"In white collar being likable is 90% of the work Sounds crazy, but it’s very true.

"Doesn't matter if you're the smartest person in the room, if you're a difficult person to communicate with or work with, and you're in a job that requires you to work with others, you're not going to go far.

Every promotion I've had, I've had to increasingly navigate social situations to dodge work I don't want to do and convince others to do work they don't want to do but is necessary for the success of our project. Being able to identify what someone else cares about, present them information in a way they resonate with, and then convince them to move forward with the task only gets more and more important the higher up you go.

Being likable is easy. Don't overshare about your personal life or gossip about others, shout people out when they help you out materially and they'll often do the same for you, don't complain to management if you don't have short term fixes and good fixes for the things that are a problem unless it's critically broken and out of your knowledge to fix, don't say things that take you out of the running for opportunities, like 'I don't want to manage people' even if it's true. You can always turn it down later if offered but they will take you out of the running preemptively if they know you've mentioned not wanting to do that work in the past.",comment_2,r/CareerAdvice,Professional,,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1kui1yn/in_white_collar_being_likable_is_90_of_the_work/

"In most life aspects, being likable is a huge factor. I know I will make mistakes, etc. So I try to have the best attitude (not complaining, even jokingly, etc) and work ethic.

At court, I try to be friendly with opposing counsel, especially in front of judges. Even if I disagree with my opponent 100%, I will drop a little compliment like ""I know {opponent's name} has done a great job advocating for his client, even if we disagree..."" So if my opponent insults me, they look spiteful and nasty, not me. 

I know for a fact that judges have ruled my way solely because they liked me better than my opponent. Nobody wants to give a win to an asshole.",comment_4,r/CareerAdvice,Professional,,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1kui1yn/in_white_collar_being_likable_is_90_of_the_work/

"I got fired after 2 months. Hi all. I started a new job because I was interested in a change from my current environment.  I was offered a position with a company who doubled my salary and promised multiple things.  I ignored multiple red flags and accepted the offer. I am a Learning and Development professional who was asked to revamp the company’s horrible onboarding process which was hemorrhaging with turnover. 

I started of to see first hand how terrible the onboarding and orientation experience truly was. Lack of communication, as a senior leader I had to seek out my own computer for IT and the welcoming was something out of the 1950’s.  At this point and being a part of meaningless three hour zoom calls I was mentally checked out.  I quickly realized that I missed my past position and started making calls.  

As I was preparing my departure I was called in a day before and informed that I was being let go for lack of performance.  I must say I was never given any clear instruction on work to be performed and would not be a part of the cult like environment I was observing.  The company meetings literally praised and worshiped the owners prior to the start of the meetings. 

I am so thankful and happy to have been fired as crazy as that sounds.  Now I have multiple offers and will definitely do my research on a company going forward.",post,r/CareerAdvice,Professional,27.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1kuflo7/i_got_fired_after_2_months/
"You didn't ask for advice, so congratulations on your lesson learned. 

In my experience, bad orientation is just another symptom of toxic culture, and not fixable by more hiring. High turnover isn't only because of bad orientation, it's usually a combination of things. So it seems like, despite you ""failing"" and being let go, you not knowing the expectations was not the reason you failed.

"Never Work On A Campaign Working on a political campaign will be the worst time of your life. You will literally work slave hours and you will be salary pay so they will make you work those hours and not have to pay you over time or anything. Also depending on the campaign if there is no team chemistry or morale it will be fucking terrible. The campaign I’m on now, everyone just barks orders at each other or accuses each other of screwing stuff up. Nobody talks about anything remotely light hearted to make the job feel less stressful. This campaign I’m working on now might be the most miserable job I have had. But given that the election is only a handful of weeks away, I feel like I already sunk so much time in that I should stay. But my patience is running thin and I’m close to snapping because of how awful this job is. It’s literally work from eyes open to eyes close. I’m so burnt out. Campaigns are honestly a scam, and it’s so normalized. If you ask for a day off they will get mad at you and tell you “it’s a campaign”.

"There 100% is a burn out for the cause mentality, but ime it also highly depends on who you’re working with. There are also candidates/law makers who employ people who are good managers and do their best. Ime there is also odd restrictions around campaign/gov workers(see reams of election law+endless desires to further complicate future elections) that make it harder for them to accommodate flexible work needs. Depends on what side of a campaign you’re working on too. Non profit canvassing, incumbent re-election strategy, etc, all have different distances from the risks and influences that might make the work sucky.

A big part of this also so many people in these spaces are used to working with and/or supplementing their workforce with volunteers. And volunteers work odd hours, and if retired for instance, might be willing to work beyond average hours. There is a community minded ethos it comes from, but it does absolutely come at the price of making the job unsustainable for most.

"Struggling at new job I started a new role 12 weeks ago, and while I was initially excited—this being a step up in my career—I’ve found myself struggling due to my manager’s leadership style and her general demeanour towards me.

She tends to be very blunt in her communication (she has even commented that people often wonder how she gets away with being so blunt), and this often leaves me feeling feeling belittled and questioning my abilities, especially when receiving feedback on relatively small mistakes. I understand I’m still learning the ropes, and while I expect feedback, the way it’s delivered sometimes makes me feel more like a child being scolded than a professional being coached. I also recognise that it is somewhat a 'me' problem as to how I take what is being fed back to me, however, drawing on my time being a team leader in a previous role, the mistakes are all small issues that I would have expected of any of my team members and I would have provided a lot more reassurance than what I am getting at the moment. I have genuinely been left feeling quite embarassed with some of the small mistakes I have made, as I really pride myself in being conscientious and taking pride in my work, but feel x1000 times worse after I am confronted with it by my manager. I think I am constantly on edge and stressing out, which causes me to make more small mistakes.

Despite this, I’ve taken on a fair amount of work and have received positive feedback from other team members, which makes me feel like I *am* making progress. However, even minor issues—such as her disagreeing with how I’ve worded an email—tend to overshadow any wins.

I’ve expressed to her that my confidence has taken a hit due to the nature of some of the feedback, and while she has offered some reassurance, I am still feeling deflated. Now I’m left wondering, did I make a mistake leaving my previous job? Am I at risk of losing this one after probation? Am I even cut out to do this job?

I genuinely want to succeed in this job. I was so excited to take this step in my career, but I’m finding my interactions with her increasingly overwhelming and demoralising, where I have been left in tears more often than not (she does not know this). I guess what I’m really asking is, how should I approach this with her in a constructive way? Or is it time to start exploring other opportunities?",post,r/CareerAdvice,Professional,2.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1kuoemm/struggling_at_new_job/

"Pivoting Careers Hello,

So I'm a masters student. I've not got a lot of experience but I've got some decent things (research assistant, student leadership, etc)

I wanted to go into consulting and policy analysis. But I was wondering if it would be smart to maybe specialize or pivot my careers

I was recommended to take a Google IT certification and get certified for IT. From this I was thinking of doing maybe tech, tech policy development etc. or just plain junior IT roles. I was wondering if this was a smart move, as I feel I need more specialized skills.

"Opinions on which career path to try? So basically I’m trying to figure out what I want to do going forward in terms of schooling, and I need opinions on which direction to go. The options I’m considering right now are going for a bachelor’s in english and/or communications (either double majoring or choosing one), or going to trade school for welding. If anyone else has any other ideas or suggestions though I’m open to hearing them.

When I initially graduated high school I went to college for aerospace engineering. I had always done really well in english, math, and physics in school, and while english was the only one I enjoyed and was honestly really passionate about going for a STEM major seemed like a smarter idea so that’s what I did. Life took a turn soon after I started though, it was just kind of one horrific life event after another and a lot of self destructive decisions, life really just kind of completely derailed. In the midst of that I dropped out of school, I was going well grade wise but I couldn’t handle the pressure of the major. I was doing an engineering internship at the time though and when they heard I was going to have an open schedule they offered me a permanent position as an engineering technician, which I worked for a year but recently quit because the company is shutting down soon. So I’m 23 now and at a point where I’ve learned a lot life wise from the past few years and am trying to just kind of slow down and rebuild. So I’m starting by trying to figure out career wise which direction to pursue. I want to make a smart decision but also do something that is in line with my natural talents and interests, and will allow me to be happy and live a lifestyle that makes me happy. While I was good at engineering and didn’t mind the work it wasn’t something I enjoyed, and I couldn’t see myself being happy doing it for the rest of my life.

I liked the idea of going back and finishing a bachelor’s, so I’ve been considering going back for english because reading classical literature and analyzing it and writing analytical reports on it has always been something I really, really loved. Like was truly passionate about and was really good at. I’ve always been into spirituality and have always been drawn to classical literature because I feel it has a huge spiritual component to it. And I’ve always been a huge academic so I like the idea of pursuing something that involves analysis and research. Like I was always very very good at writing, not stories or anything but reports and research papers and stuff like that. I don’t know exactly what I would do with that degree is the only problem, however I would or could likely get some sort of writing career which I would absolutely love. The major is just something I think I would be really good at and really love.

I’ve also been considering a bachelor’s in communication. Like I said I’ve always been really good at writing and my use of words. I’m also really good at and really, really love public speaking. I had to take a public speaking class in high school and found that out there. I ended up being really good at it to the point where my school and the local rotary club were sponsoring me to speak at school and rotary club events and to compete in speech competitions (which I didn’t even realize was a thing until then but they were so fun lol). Again I’m not totally sure what I would want to do with that degree, I would likely do something with writing or journalism though. I would love to be a motivational speaker actually or do something like that in a written form, like that would be my dream job actually. I feel like I have a lot to say and ways of communicating it just have no idea how to get an audience or actually make it happen in the form of a career.

I’ve also been considering trade school because when I was working as a engineering technician it was for a machine shop, and I would sometimes go out and help in the shop when needed (and the guys out there were awesome they would bring me out to try things out and teach me because it would help me a lot with my job too). That’s when I learned I’m very mechanically inclined and actually really love working with my hands like that. Which makes sense everyone in my family is like that I just didn’t realize I was too because I’d never tried anything like that before lol. I tried mostly machining but a little welding and brazing too and think I’d really enjoy welding. My only concern is I really love to travel and really want a more flexible and possibly remote career, and I feel like my other options would allow for that more. Trade school would be less debt though which I really like lol.

I just basically want a career I can build and work towards and establish (like that will have tangible results that I can feel accomplished in), and be happy and enjoy while doing so. I really really don’t like the idea of a typical 9 to 5 schedule, I like more freedom and a more flexible schedule. Idk any input would be appreciated.

"How I learned to enjoy networking by treating it like collecting interesting stories instead of contacts I used to dread networking events because they felt fake and transactional. I'd awkwardly exchange business cards with people I'd never talk to again. Then I completely reframed my approach.

Instead of trying to ""network,"" I started going to events with genuine curiosity about people's career paths. I'd ask questions like ""What's the most surprising thing about your industry?"" or ""What made you switch from marketing to product design?""

Suddenly, networking became fascinating. I learned about a woman who left corporate law to become a bread baker, a guy who designs video game sound effects, and someone who helps companies name their products. Each conversation became a mini-documentary about someone's professional journey.

The weird thing is, this approach has led to way more genuine professional connections than traditional networking ever did. People remember the person who was genuinely interested in their story, not the one who just wanted their contact info.

Anyone else found unconventional approaches to professional networking that actually work?",post,r/CareerAdvice,Professional,2.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1kunbvf/how_i_learned_to_enjoy_networking_by_treating_it/
"love vs career I’m 25 and at a bit of a crossroads. I’ve just finished a finance degree and have a job lined up in my very small hometown. It’s stable, the pay is decent, and it could lead to a solid career. But it’s in a small town — not exactly where I see myself long term.

Here’s the twist: I met someone amazing while traveling and we’ve kept things going long-distance. He lives in Switzerland. It’s real — not just a fling — and I genuinely see potential. I can get a 1 year visa there. The idea of moving there, doing something different (like working in a cafe for a year), and just living feels exciting. But obviously, that would mean stepping away from my career path for a while, and potentially starting from scratch when I come back.

I go back and forth constantly. Part of me says I’m young, I’ll regret it if I don’t take the leap. Another part says I’ve worked hard for this career and shouldn’t throw it away for a guy — especially if I’m not 100% sure how things will pan out.

Has anyone here been in a similar situation? Chosen love over career (or vice versa)? Would love some honest perspectives, especially from people who’ve made big international moves or taken detours early in their career.

"There was an earlier post saying that you shouldn’t go into nursing if you can’t find a CS job… what should I do then? I’ve been out of a job for a full year with 10 years of experience as a backend java engineer. I have a bachelors and masters from a top engineering school that has the word Tech in the name. I haven’t been able to find anything. And I’m most definitely open to 5 days a week in office, anything!

I was premed back in college so I had a lot of prereq classes, which would hopefully give me a leg up in preparing to apply to an accelerated nursing program.

Why nursing? Because it’s a good way of getting a somewhat decent salary that’s actually in demand without all the schooling involved with medicine, dental, PA etc. Yeah it’s not an easy job, nothing worth doing is easy. But it’s stable and offers job security. I won’t be tossed aside like in tech and I won’t have to constantly keep up with the latest and greatest (I don’t mind doing this but the pace expected in tech is absurd).

When I’m off the clock, I can stop thinking about work , unlike with tech where I have to make my life about tech.

"IS THERE ANY REAL SHOT AT GETTING INTO A SOLID LEGAL OR CORPORATE JOB ABROAD WHEN YOU'RE A FOREIGNER WITHOUT A DEGREE FROM A PRESTIGIOUS UNIVERSITY? I’ve been struggling with this question for a while: do mid-to-large law firms or serious companies in places like the U.S., Canada, or Europe ever actually consider foreign candidates who didn’t graduate from top schools — and who don’t have impressive connections?

In Brazil, the reality is pretty harsh. The best opportunities in law, finance, consulting, engineering, or in competitive corporate roles usually go to people who graduate from top public universities or elite private schools — kind of like the Brazilian equivalent of a UC Berkeley, University of Michigan, or a private school like NYU or Georgetown. If you didn’t go to one of those, you’re usually overlooked from the start. And referrals are everything — especially in law. If you don’t have an “in” somewhere, you’re just another name in a stack of resumes.

I graduated two years ago from a small, regional private university. Since then, it’s been really hard to get any meaningful experience. I live in a mid-sized city in southern Brazil, and I’ve been unemployed for a while now.

The only job I’ve managed to get so far was through a friend’s recommendation — a small law office with no contract and no benefits. I’ve gone to multiple interviews, and more than once I’ve heard things like “we prioritize people who come recommended by someone who’s already part of our network.”

Hoping to improve my prospects, I enrolled in a postgraduate program at a better-regarded school. But after all that, I was told pretty bluntly: *“it doesn’t really help if your undergraduate degree doesn’t stand out.”*

Lately, I’ve been thinking about trying my luck abroad. Not in some fantasy of becoming a partner at a top firm overnight — I know that’s unrealistic — but I wonder:  
**Is there even a chance for someone like me to break into a mid-sized or growing law firm or company abroad? To be taken seriously? To at least get a foot in the door in a structured environment where I could grow?**

Some people have told me flat out: *“You should give up on that and aim for blue-collar work. The corporate world isn’t for someone from a background like yours.”* And honestly, I’m starting to believe they might be right.

But I just want to know from someone with experience:  
Is there any real path for a foreign law graduate — without a big-name diploma or a high-powered network — to be seen as a potential asset by firms or companies in places like the U.S., Canada, or Europe?

What steps could actually help make that happen?

Any insight or honest advice would mean a lot. I don’t expect miracles — just hoping to understand if there’s a real path forward here, or if I’ve been chasing something that doesn’t exist for people like me.

I’ve been diving deep into the job search lately think of it like the “I’m stuck in a Choose-Your-Own-Adventure novel, but every choice leads to a dead end” kind of feeling. It’s not just about rewriting my resume a hundred times; it’s the mix of wondering if I’m overqualified or underqualified, if I’m missing some secret handshake in interviews, or if it’s just the market. Here’s the twist I’ve also been dabbling in digital marketing skills through free resources (hello, YouTube marathons and Reddit rabbit holes), thinking maybe I can build something for myself. I’m not talking about overnight riches or vague “side hustle” promises I’m trying to carve out a small lane where I’m not just waiting for callbacks that may never come.   
  
So here’s my ask—has anyone else here tried mixing a self-taught skill with the job search struggle? How do you balance the feeling of being stuck with the hope that maybe your extra efforts (like me, learning copywriting, or starting a small online gig) will eventually pay off?",post,r/CareerAdvice,Professional,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1kunrdz/rejected_ghosted_and_learning_how_are_you_all/
"Disappointing raise after month long wait Looking for input on my current situation. Have worked for this company for 5 years, making low but survivable pay. Currently at $19.50hr in current position, after a few raises that were hard earned. One month ago, my manager asked if I'd be interested in learning more about a ""team leader"" position that was being created as a result of our company merging with another bigger one. I said sure, tell me more. At the time, HR was still restructuring and working out pay, so they couldn't give me an exact description/pay rate, so I asked that I be given an opportunity to have that discussion before anything was made public or official company-wide, and in the meantime I would just attend some meetings to get insight, and help on some basic projects as a training experience. 

Asked at least 4 times over the next month if/when the details would be available, and kept getting the boiler plate response of ""soon."" In the meantime, they went ahead and did make my position change public to our team, which made me uncomfortable for obvious reasons. The over-all outline of the job was still vague, but I was told ultimately that it would involve overseeing and have direct report staff, managing their time-sheets/pay, as well as the project management side. 

Bottom line, after waiting a month, my manager said, ok the pay rate has been approved, and is reflected in your pay software. I checked and had to do a double-take to even see the difference. It was $1.40, or 7%. To me, that was insultingly, and negligibly low. To go from simply being responsible for myself with no broader scope of work, to effectively being a supervisor (even though they won't call it that), and basically making the same pay tier as people I'm overseeing is ridiculous. I told them that at least $3hr more was my minimum, as it signifies some kind of worthwhile difference. They said the rate is fixed, and non-negotiable.  Where's the incentive to take on all the extra responsibility for almost the same pay as your subordinates? It's particularly disappointing, as I was looking forward to moving into that role, and I feel like they strung me along. I'm sure they could have at least provided a likely pay range up front so that I could have made an informed choice upfront and avoid being in the situation ass-backwards. So now my choice is take the shitty raise, or go back to my original position. 

TLDR: Feel like I got screwed and lead-on for a month only to get a disappointing offer.",post,r/CareerAdvice,Professional,6.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ku96mv/disappointing_raise_after_month_long_wait/

"I get that every situation is unique and presents its own set of challenges. But, you really need to find a way out of this job. The exact same thing happened to me during COVID. I was working a job that I really loved, totally responsible for only my own production. One day manager calls and says they want me to be a division lead for a different division (I had several years experience in that work class but was working a different role). 

Naturally, I asked for the details and was shocked to see that it would only be a $1 raise. I think I went from $20.50 to $21.50. Anyway, I turned it down after a day of thinking on it. I was then pressured to ”re-think” that decision and ultimately caved. It ultimately led to my resignation from the company after about a 17 months. In that time, I went through a couple of pay raises - one due to COVID and one from 6 month or 1 year review - I don’t remember if it was one or both.  I was at $24.75 when I left and couldn’t get out of there fast enough. I took a pay cut to move back to a similar role of what I was pulled out of. The job I left for started at $24.50 but also had 5 hours of overtime a week. I did have to drive about an hour a day extra but I was still making more by the time my 90 day review came - both hourly and especially with the OT. 

Back to the place that forced me into a “manager” job, I knew I made a mistake about a month into it. But by that time, my old job wasn’t there to go back to for market reasons (COVID). In a weird way, it was good that I took the job because I would have gotten laid off if I didn’t. But that could have been ok too as I could have followed another opportunity in a role I actually wanted. After about 3 months, I started looking for jobs and applied for many between that time and the time I got an offer. Probably at least 30. I even decided to go back to school for my BAS just so I could GTFO of there. 

Your situation has some similar red flags, in that its more work and responsibility/stress for a ridiculously insulting pay increase, and HR’s mishandling of the discussion with the rest of the process surrounding compensation & letting people know before you had an official job title/position description. 

What I learned from my experience is that management should always post job openings for internal applicants - they can encourage employees to apply, but that should be as far as they go. Of course, the pre-requisite to posting would be that 95% of the details are worked out and listed. It’s fair to have some wiggle room for negotiation, but core properties of the role shouldn’t change. 

Ultimately, you are going to have to go with your gut on what to do. My opinion is that you should return to your previous role if you still can, while also being more proactive in looking to leave the company. Obviously, this may not happen next week, but you should set some goals/milestones to keep yourself accountable to yourself. 

It sounds like you have a pretty good head on your shoulders, so I‘m sure you will come out fine in the end. 

TLDR: IMO go back you your old position and look for a new job elsewhere.",comment_5,r/CareerAdvice,Professional,,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ku96mv/disappointing_raise_after_month_long_wait/

"Quit now, or after a week? Two weeks ago, I accepted a job offer; my start date is Tuesday, right after this long weekend here in the US. I was offered another role at another company (which I prefer) this week, and have also accepted. 

For context, earlier this year I went through the full interview process, and did not get offered the job at Company A (retail). The in-house recruiter I had been communicating with gave me feedback related to their decision to go with another candidate. With that being said, the company thought I was a great fit and told me to reach out directly to her if a role was posted that I was interested in. Fast forward maybe two months, she reaches out saying they had an open position for the exact role I had previously applied for, just at a different store location. She said I wouldn't have to go through the full interview process again, and just wanted me to visit the store and interview with the current store manager, basically as a vibe check. Interview went great, and I was offered the role the following week. We discussed I would put in my two-week notice for my current role and start right after my position ended with my current company. 

Of course, Company A had not been the only company I had been applying and interviewing for. When Company A reached out with this offer to interview again, I was in the final round interview with Company B. Company B required a take-assignment after the final round interview. At this point, I had already accepted the role at Company A, but figured why not submit the assessment since I had already gotten so far along in the process, and I preferred Company B to Company A. Fast forward, I was offered the role at Company B this week, and have accepted. 

There is a one week starting date difference between the two jobs. So my question is, do I quit Company A now (the weekend before I start-date), or do my first week at Company A, and then quit at the end of the week? I wouldn't have to give them a two-week notice because it's an at-will contract, and besides given the short time I will have been at the company I doubt they'll want me to anyway. This was one of my best interview experiences thus far, and every single person I've interacted with has been professional and kind. I really do not want to leave this company with a poor impression of my level of professionalism and decorum, and don't know which option would be better for all parties involved. I've already been fully onboarded, so unfortunately either way, time and other resources have already been spent on me as an employee. Company A also never publicly listed this job, I was contacted directly about my interest first, so I know they have no other candidates. 

TLDR: Quit my job the weekend before I start, or quit after working a full-week (at-will contract). Onboarding has been fully completed, so either way the time and other resources has been spent.",post,r/CareerAdvice,Professional,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1kunj0k/quit_now_or_after_a_week/

"Should I move abroad for work or stay closer to home in India? I’m 24 and have about 1+ year of experience in the industry. I’m at a point where I want to make a career move and shift out of my hometown — either to another city in India or to a different country altogether.

I’ve been seriously considering moving to Singapore. It’s close (just a 5-hour flight), has a much better quality of life, and would give me the international exposure I’ve always wanted. But I’m also torn — my parents are getting older, and even though they’re supportive, I know they’d want me to stay closer. Honestly, I want that too.

Even if I move to a different Indian city, I’d still be a 2–3 hour flight away. But for them, moving abroad feels more permanent. They worry that if I go to Singapore, I might end up settling there for good. I don’t know if that’ll happen — my current plan is to spend a few years there, grow professionally, and then come back to India.

"I'm stressing myself out, I do too much, I need help, I want a new job The last couple of years I've been employed with 3 jobs but only working 2 at a time. Two jobs are part time during the day which I bounce and forth on. One of the jobs I'm able to have holidays and summer off so I work at my other day job during those times. My third job is full time during the night. I work M-F, getting up at 7am and falling asleep 3am the next day. My day job starts at 8am and my night job ends 2am the next day. Basically I work almost 15 hours (including lunch), not including commute time which is 1-1.5 hours extra.

I'm financially stable, however, I live in a 4 person household where only me and another person work, sometimes just me, gratefully when it's 3 people. I pay my bills and half of rent. I pay a total of 2 car insurances and 3 phone bills, and weekly groceries for 2 people or 4 people. Sometimes I put money towards savings, sometimes I don't.

I recently am trying to lose fat and build muscles so since the beginning of this year, I've been working out 2x weekly, only on weekends, and being on a calorie deficit. However, with lack of sleep (getting minimum of 4 hours and max 6 hours bc I take multiple naps), I haven't seen progress.

I now just started my Master's degree (online school) the beginning of this month and unfortunately have to pay out of pocket due to not receiving financial aid and too busy to even apply for scholarships, leaving me to pay $1K+ monthly. Mind you, I'm only take 1-2 classes a semester. I wanted to take 3 years but since I'm paying out of pocket with no help, it's gonna take me 6-7 years.

I'm exhausted. I'm working 2-3 jobs, working out, sleeping less, going to school, and not getting any financial help. I try to have a life outside of work such as going to sports games, concerts, food events, and hanging out with friends. However, with all my bills and tuition, I now have little to no money to pay for more of these events. I have already paid for some in advance but with gas, merch, food, etc I need to spend wisely.

I'm tired of having 3 jobs, I want a single job that works 12 hours daily and a pay rate that I would like. I'm a psychology student and have been working as a behavior tech. I want to work in my field that's in an office/hospital setting. But with barely starting my Master's degree, I can't find jobs that will take me.

"How to cope with new job I left an office job that I truly loved. It felt like a huge part of my identity—my coworkers were some of my closest friends, and I felt rooted there. But I could see the writing on the wall: the company was headed toward a major reorganization, and the environment was changing fast. I knew I had to get out before it all unraveled.

I took a remote job that offered more money, thinking it was the right move. From the very first week, I knew I’d made a mistake. The culture is cutthroat. There’s no support, no real structure, and absolutely no sense of team. It’s all about “what can you do for us?”—there’s no strategy, just chaos. Everything feels built on personal opinions and politics, not actual plans. The environment is toxic, fake, and constantly shifting.

Just a month in, my boss left, and I’ve felt completely isolated ever since. I have touchpoints with execs, but I’m also expected to have difficult conversations that no one prepares me for. I’m thrown onto investor calls, handed more responsibilities, but all I get in return are cold shoulders, vague feedback, or worse—nothing at all. On paper, it looks like I’m doing well, but the way I’m treated makes it feel like they can’t stand me. It’s incredibly confusing and disheartening.

At this point, it’s affecting my health. I feel miserable and deeply depressed. I’m barely taking care of myself—some days I can’t even shower or wash my hair. I don’t leave the house. I wake up trying to stay hopeful, but the moment I check messages or get pulled into the next fire drill, I spiral into anxiety. The feedback I get is all over the place, and I can’t keep up with the constant shifts in expectations.

I want to quit. I really do. But right now, I feel stuck. I don’t know how to survive this without completely losing myself.

"Asked to work almost every weekend - How to ask for compensation beyond basic overtime (Corporate 9-5)? 
Hey Reddit,

I'm in a bit of a tricky situation and could use some advice from those with corporate experience, especially in Canada.

I work a standard 9-5 corporate job, and recently, I've been asked to work almost every weekend going forward. When I brought up concerns about this with my manager, she said it ""doesn't matter if I work on weekends or weekdays, it's not industry standard to pay beyond overtime.""

I understand that overtime is legally mandated, and I'll be paid for those hours. However, working consistently on weekends significantly impacts my work-life balance, personal time, and overall well-being. It's not just about the extra hours, but the constant disruption to my non-work life.

My questions for you all are:

How can I effectively articulate the value of my weekend time beyond just an hourly rate? I want to convey that the sacrifice of my personal life for consistent weekend work warrants more than just 1.5x my regular pay. To be clear, an extra day off during the week doesn't make sense for my role/workflow, so I'm looking for other creative solutions.

What's the best way to approach this conversation with my manager again? I don't want to come across as ungrateful for the overtime, but I need to advocate for myself and my time.

Is her statement about ""industry standard"" truly accurate for corporate 9-5 roles in Canada, or are there nuances I can point to?
Any general tips on negotiating for better work-life balance or compensation in similar situations?

I'm feeling a bit burnt out at the prospect of losing my weekends indefinitely. Any advice or experiences you can share would be greatly appreciated!

Thanks in advance.",post,r/CareerAdvice,Professional,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1kufhib/asked_to_work_almost_every_weekend_how_to_ask_for/

For the other part, interior design, is more design bases, it have less law and burocracy contents and i think it could have an easier entrance for luxury and fashion industry (That is the industry I’m most interested in)

I will study in Portugal or I’ve been think in France too but most likely in Portugal ( Because I’m Spanish and it’s easier for me to do the bachelor there and maybe then a masters degree in France)

Hi everyone,

I (34 M) have been working as a school counselor/School social worker for the past 10 years (with leadership-role). Over the last two years, I’ve completed a Master’s degree in Social Work. Toward the end of my program, I realized I want to change direction and pursue a career in Human Resources.

This fall I will be starting a second Master's program in Management, Organization and Society. I've also completed 60 ECTS credits in Strategic HR and Management (equivalent to two-thirds of a Bachelor’s degree in that subject, though I need 90 ECTS to formally graduate with the degree).

My goal is to work either as an HR Business Partner or in Learning & Development. I am particularly interested in leadership, organizational development, and talent management. I believe my background in psychosocial work, collaboration, and working with systems-level support in schools could be transferable to HR roles.

"Career searching with bad driving record. Pennsylvania

Hi all — I’m applying for a non-CDL position that may involve driving a company vehicle. I had an ARD for a DUI in April 2023, which has since been expunged. I also had older driving-related offenses back in 2006–2007 (including a DUI conviction in 2007 and an accident involving damage that led to an ARD in 2006), but nothing since.

My criminal record is clean now, and I’ve worked hard to move forward and stay on the right path. However, I know employers and insurance providers sometimes check driving histories, and I’m trying to understand how far back they typically look — especially in Pennsylvania.

Would this expunged DUI still show up in a background check or insurance review? Will older offenses from 2007 matter, even if they don’t show on PATCH or Clean Slate?

I want to be upfront, but I’m also trying to figure out how much of this I need to disclose if the application didn’t ask directly. Any HR folks or hiring managers familiar with Pennsylvania law and company vehicle policies — I’d really appreciate your insight.

I don't think I can give up personal trading, which is a significant source of my side income, now getting to a level that it's bigger than my main compensation from my employer.

I am shit scared that my employer find out about my day trading from the automated reports out and fire me. Do you have any advice as to how I can keep my job and continue trading?",post,r/CareerAdvice,Professional,10.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ku0xy6/conflict_of_interest_with_employer_as_a_day_trader/
"Working a day job and day trading

"You can't. And you might fuck around and get tangled in sanctions and insider trading prosecution. Which means no more financial services jobs after you get out of prison. 

I quit a job because they failed to tell me my role was in the Private side of Bank of America. The role paid less but I'd have the opportunity to relocate and move up in a line of business with stability and my trading makes up for a lower salary. I trade a consistent goal of $4000+ each month regardless of the market. They wanted me to get approval for every trade. I day trade so that's not possible. 

On top.of that, the state I'd move to have income tax and my current state doesn't. So I let them go. They didn't even ask me for my Merrill and Fidelity logins, they just knew because of affiliation and started monitoring me!!!! That pissed me off more than anything. 

I just have some old 401k accounts there, I don't trade with those old fashioned slow platforms. I day trade with eTrade.  I was so pissed off that they were so aggressive I thought about not telling them about the Etrade account. But I know they would just check FNRA. And it's not my style to be deceptive to that degree and open myselfto sanctions, so I just resigned after 5 weeks.

They emailed me after I earned $1500 on a $DASH trade in less than 3 hours (I bought premarket and set a sell order the minute my buy executed, like I always do, my day's goal is made by 11am and I plot moves the remainderof the day. So they're judgemental and jealous too. I told them I'd already resigned and was just working the rest of the week, so chill.  So it's more than them thinking you will get inside information there are employees who put in their two cents - it's not their business how much make trading.

2. Is your boss the kind of person that will track time? (I e. You got in at 8:04, you stay until 5:04)
3. How much time do you think the day trading takes?

If it's 'yes' then 'no', then 3 doesn't matter.  You get your shit done and boss is a reasonable fellow.

"Need Help to Start a Start-up/Remote Job. Want to make a Major Pivot in Life. Hey everyone! I wanted to share a bit about myself and ask for your advice. I’m a leader and entrepreneur with 11+ years of experience in Luxury Retail/Wholesale/Manufacturing(Diamond Jewelry), International Commodities Trading (Iron Ore), and Omni-Channel Retail (Fashion Rental). I love working in Operations, Sales, Support, and Marketing. I also have a Master’s in Computer Science, though I’ve never been in the corporate world and don’t know much about its jargon. What I \*do\* know is how to get things done and make a real impact in any business I take on.



That said, I’ve faced many challenges in Indian workplaces. Some of the common ones are people dealing in black money, evading taxes, giving/accepting bribes, mis-selling products, or adulterating goods. I’ve also seen people target those doing honest, clean work simply because it affects the ones taking shortcuts or being unethical. There’s also a tendency to expect unrealistic results, like getting a baby in 9 days instead of 9 months or wanting instant success as soon as you start something. On top of that, hardworking employees are either overburdened or underpaid, while dishonest people sometimes thrive. It’s frustrating to deal with situations like this, and the list goes on.



I’m now at a turning point where I want to build a business in India that’s ethical, sustainable, and makes ""happy money"" — money earned the right way with the right people in the right place. Over the years, I’ve realized that no matter how talented or hardworking someone is, it doesn’t work if you’re in the wrong environment with the wrong people doing the wrong things. That’s why I want to shift my focus and make changes in my professional, personal, social, and spiritual life.



I also understand there are many young people making a lot of money in high-pressure work cultures. While I respect their hustle and hard work, I’m not looking to adopt a toxic lifestyle. I’m not interested in an unhealthy grind where people skip sleep for days, rely on caffeine, alcohol, or substances to cope, and burn out. I want to work hard but in a balanced, healthy, and ethical way.



So here’s my question: \*\*What are some good business ideas or Jobs that align with these values, focus on integrity, and foster a positive work environment here in India?\*\* I’d love to hear your suggestions/recommendations!",post,r/CareerAdvice,Professional,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1kud4lh/need_help_to_start_a_startupremote_job_want_to/
"Exclusive TCS NINJA TECHNICAL experience So on 22nd May I went for the Ninja interview. Coming straight to the point ( not writing any screening , waiting rr) , went in he asked for name , native place and department . He was looking for something , i thought maybe he's looking for my resume . I tried handing over one( I carried 3 xerox of it) to which he said ""no no I don't need that"" ( Aisa kya doc hai mera jo iske pass hai aur isi he nhi mil rha) . Anyways , I was sitting there holding my compse until he said 
""You got good marks in social science , u had a interest in that ?""
I said yes at that time I used to study that (Ratta maar k toh number aate the social science me)
He then asked ""what happened in 1857 ?"" 
I went blank thinking it was supposed to be a technical round, anyways I was not able toh answer that he then tried dragging me into history . I too kept trying to come out of that and then finally he went rigid on ""What was your fav subject in 11th 12th ?""  
(It was supposed to be TECHNICAL, mind it)
I had no other option so I said PHYSICS.
That Elite gentleman tried almost every possible question that he knew from NLM , KE ,  PE and Projectile motion. 
Since I was good in it I answered everything thinking if I'm still preparing for JEE. 
(IT'S TECHNICAL FYI) 

Then he gave me a binary to decimal conversion on paper and vice versa wid logics. I did it 
He then said to write a code for it , i was ok wid it then as soon as I started he said - ""wait ,write for binary to hexadecimal"" 
I never came across all this in LC at least and tbvh i forgot the implementation part still I started writing. 
2 mins after he said ""hobe na"" ( means Nhi hoga ) 
Bro first of all it's FCKNG NINJA , Second give me some time u Einstein's shit. Then they told me if this is the condition in this code what will happen if they'd give me any searching sorting algorithms to write. I accepted it that yes I'm ok with asking them these stuffs . 
They already made the mind of not selecting me still the lady who was sitting there asked binary search from me . I explained everything and then they said "" we are not selecting you for this time , you can leave the venue now""

"Contract work next week or wait for FTE opp? I have not had a job in almost 6 months was laid off. I may get a 1 year contract opportunity which needs me to start very asap. I have 2 applications in at companies where I have very strong internal referrals -
Which will take about 6-8 weeks to complete the hiring process.
I am conflicted.
1. If I take the contract work, I am responsible for taxes, getting my own medical and 401k…
As an FTE at the other company they will handle all of that…
2. When the contract is over I’ll be out of a job, as an FTE I have no deadline but as we know there is no such a thing as job b security.
3. I have strong references to the FTE, director level people who support my candidacy and spoke on my behalf to the hiring managers. 
4. I could very well not get the FTE jobs… it has happened before…

I could take the contract and if I get the FTE job resign… but I feel shitty doing that…

"Thoughts on Account Executive role at Gartner? I’d love to get your thoughts on Gartner. I have an interview for an Account Executive position, and I’ve been getting really mixed signals.

On one hand, Glassdoor shows a solid employee rating (around 4 stars), and it seems like Gartner has a good reputation overall. But from reading posts on this sub, I’ve also seen a lot of people mention a toxic or highly political culture, and that your success there is heavily dependent on your manager.

For context, I currently work at a FAANG company in a hybrid BDR/AE role. I don’t love it, but I’m comfortable. The main issue is that I don’t see a clear path for progression over the next 2–2.5 years, which is why I’m seriously considering this move. The Gartner role would mean the same base salary but would introduce commission, which I don’t have in my current role.

Has anyone here worked as an AE at Gartner or have any insight into the culture, expectations, and growth opportunities? The role would be liaising with C-Suite clients, upselling and winning new contracts. Potential path for Enterprise Sales possibly?

Any honest feedback would be super appreciated.

"Am I in a hostile work environment or just being overly sensitive? I really need outside perspective because I’m second-guessing myself constantly.

I’m a Senior SEO Strategist in the U.S., working for a company where I manage two direct reports and handle SEO strategy for one of our sites. I’ve been in this role for a while (was promised the title “Manager” multiple times but never received it, despite completing manager training 3 years ago and acting as one ever since).

I took protected leave in July 2024: 3 months of paid maternity leave, then 2 months of short-term disability for postpartum anxiety. I returned end of December 2024, fully reengaged. I’ve been transparent, proactive, and doing more than expected—including identifying one direct report who stopped working for 3 weeks and onboarding a new hire who needed a lot of support.

Since returning, the environment has changed dramatically:

I’ve been publicly criticized and called out in meetings by our VP, sometimes to the point of tears.

I was told saying “I’m doing my best” could get me fired.

I was told “nothing will ever be good enough.”

My manager told me not to “shine too bright” and echoed similar discouraging language.

We’re now (all of my team and other teams) are required to document every task we do, in extreme detail—while being denied the ability to make basic SEO changes (H1s, meta titles, etc.), work on backlinks, or consolidate content (even though my job description includes all those tasks).

I’ve asked for KPIs or formal performance goals this year. I was told “we don’t have one.”

Last week I was asked by my VP about pages not being published.  I was confused and responded saying I was asked not to work on them. My manager and Director backed me up. The VP then said show me in writing where I said this. 

Our VP makes indirect comments like “SEOs have had 2.5 years on this and we’re not ranking” — but I’ve only been active on this site for ~5 months due to maternity leave. And the comparison doesn’t account for differences in resources or site challenges.

On top of that, my job description hasn’t been updated in over 18 months. I’ve changed verticals and am on a totally different site now.

I love my job. I care about my team. But I feel like I’m being set up to fail. I’m managing others without the title, I’m held accountable without authority, and the pressure to be perfect without tools is exhausting. I’m seeing a therapist again because this environment is triggering a trauma response from a past abusive relationship.

Fwiw every annual performance has been very positive.  I regularly ask my manager and director for constructive feedback.  They consistently have none. Im well respected in other verticals. 

Also others have voiced their similar concerns regarding my VPs behaviors. 

I don’t want to overreact. I haven’t formally filed anything—yet. I have a meeting with HR soon and I’m preparing documentation. But does this sound like a toxic environment? Am I being unreasonable?

I’d really appreciate any advice or perspective.",post,r/CareerAdvice,Professional,7.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ktzl5m/am_i_in_a_hostile_work_environment_or_just_being/

"Took a gamble on something and it paid off About eight months ago I was doing nothing fun or purely productive. I had a decent job, decent pay, but completely burned out and feeling like I was just going through the motions. I had some money sitting in savings that wasn't really doing anything and I kept having this thought about a business idea I'd been playing around with.

It was nothing revolutionary like just a service I noticed was missing in my area that I thought I could do better than the existing options. I'm being intentionally vague because it's pretty niche, but think local service business that requires more skill than people realize.  
After months of overthinking it I finally just said screw it and used some of my savings to get started. Bought some equipment, got the necessary certifications, built a basic website and started reaching out to potential customers. The first few months were very very hard. I was working my regular job during the day and trying to build this thing nights and weekends. I had plenty of moments where I wondered if I'd just thrown money down a drain.

But something clicked after 5 months or so. Word of mouth started picking up and I got a few bigger contracts and suddenly I'm actually making decent money from this thing. The weirdest part is how much more motivated I feel overall. Even my performance at my regular job has improved because I'm not constantly feeling trapped, but it's too late.

"for those of you outside the US always curious about when we say states are ""at-will employment"" this is from the employee handbook for a new position I was just offered, and this is pretty much what it means and is the 'at-will' standard:   
  
""**Employment at Will:** Employment at ""business name"" is Employment at Will and may be terminated at the will of either the associate or the employer at any time, with or without cause and without advance notice, unless there is a conflict with state or local law. Except for the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of ""business name"", no manager, supervisor, or representative of the company has any authority to enter into any agreement for employment for any specified period of time or to make any agreement for employment other than at-will. Only the CEO can make such an agreement, and then only in writing.""

so yeah. basically you can be fired or quit for any or no reason, at any time, with or without warning. you cannot be fired for being a part of protected classes such as race and ethnicity, gender, sexuality, religion, disability, etc as that would be discrimination, but as i'm sure you can imagine - it's very easy for them to just say ""you're no longer a fit"" even if it's for a discriminatory reason. & also VERY hard to prove.",post,r/jobs,Professional,52.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1kujx9n/for_those_of_you_outside_the_us_always_curious/

You do this 5 days a week... nonstop.

"Not feeling excited about starting new job- did I make a mistake? Hi all,

Friday was my last day at a job I truly loved- but one that became incredibly toxic. I was in a leadership role, and upper management was extremely difficult to work with, for everyone. The turnover rate was the highest I’ve ever seen.

I had left a job I enjoyed a year ago to take this one because it offered more flexibility, better pay, and solid state/government benefits. On paper, it seemed like a great move.

But after nearly a year of some of the most unhinged workplace behavior I’ve ever experienced, I decided to leave. I applied for a few roles and landed a new job, still in the state/government system, with a 40% pay increase and great flexibility. I should be excited.

Instead, I feel sad and numb.

My team loved me. I had the best retention in our department, and when I told them I was leaving, they cried. They told me they’d only stayed as long as they did because I was the best supervisor they’d ever had. That meant the world to me and it also broke my heart.

I start my new job Tuesday. It’s a bit outside my previous experience, and I’m feeling passive, disconnected, and anxious. I wasn’t ready to start over so soon, but here I am. I know I made the right decision, it was my choice, and I wouldn’t have left if the environment hadn’t been so intolerable but it’s still hitting me hard.

Has anyone else felt this way after leaving a toxic job, even when you know it was the right move? How did you cope? I think I might be more burned out than I realized.",post,r/jobs,Professional,16.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1kul7lp/not_feeling_excited_about_starting_new_job_did_i/
"It’s not the the new job you’re dealing with. It’s the drain of leaving a toxic environment. It’s having built an amazing team and now, having to say good bye to them. I know it’s too late, but I would have built in at least 1-2 weeks to reset. The good thing is, you have previous leadership experience, so you have an idea of typical workload expectations.  For the first 1-2 weeks, make every effort to not stay over. Use  the after hours to relax and take care of yourself.

"I think it’s normal to feel that way. I felt it too when I changed, took a break, and had to start over. You’re so ready to get going again, then it’s time and the butterflies set in. It’s a huge lifestyle change in a way and changes always take some adjusting, but change is good. Just go in and do your best, there will be support and on-boarding to get you up to speed in no time. I felt like I forgot everything I knew already and it took me getting comfortable again for it to all come back.

"Do you think employers care more about ""corporate etiquette"" than skills?

I feel like the stereo type isn't as prevalent as it used to be. When talking to other students, I'm still in college, most of the people with prestigious FAANG internships aren't nessicarily the best or most skilled programmers I've met, but they're all super straight laced and appear to come from privileged backgrounds.

"Hey OP. 49 year old corporate veteran here. Have experience across many different business and roles. 

There are three variables regarding how well staff are viewed by employers:

- Reliability - do you do what you say you’ll do when you say you’ll do it?
- Professional/technical ability - are you good at the actual tasks the comprise the core of your job?
- Easy to work with - are you easy to work with or argumentative and difficult?

If you’ve got all three - you’re going places. If you’ve got two - you’ll be fine. If you’ve only got one… well, good luck. 

Someone that is reliable and easy to work with is more likely to be employed than a flaky, unpleasant but technically brilliant person.

"Rejected from every job I’ve ever applied for for over 5 years. It is so soul crushing I'm 36F, and I've been rejected from literally thousands of jobs. Every single response I get back is ""your skills are very impressive, we went with someone who fits more with our needs. We'll keep your resume on file incase something comes up."" I lost my job due to Covid and couldn't return to work after that bc my sons school didn't return to full time. And even before Covid I always had a hard time finding stable work, majority of the work I got wound up being scams, it was like I had the words ""desperate loser"", tattooed on my forehead. And even when I think I have a chance the rug gets pulled out from under my feet. 

I've been ghosted even while in the process of setting up an interview that's the best, ""we would like to set up you up on an interview what days and times work for you?"" Respond and then it's 2,3,4,5, 7 days with no response and then get the response, ""it was a pleasure talking with you, though you have excellent skills we went with someone else"", I didn't even get a chance to meet with you. I honestly don't think there has ever been someone who has tried harder then me to get a job. Ive always had the cards stacked against, I was kicked out of college for not qualifying for anymore financial aid and when I was looking for work then employers didn't like the fact that I wasn't in college. 

I went to a trade school in the interim and I was the youngest in my class, everyone else there were already professionals with 10-20 years experience and were taking these courses to change careers or learn new programs. I was the only one who didn't get placed in a job bc of my lack of experience and my advisor even said ""I was the biggest embarrassment to the school and her, that I was a total failure."" When I was finally about to return to college to finish my degree I graduated without an internship because of credits that transferred over and took these courses credits I would have gotten for an internship. I have probably applied to every business where I live about 5-6 times in the last 5 going on 6 years. I've had my resume professionally redone and even that's not enough. I see everyone I grew up have these successful careers and I can't even get a job in customer service for $18.00per/hr which is minimum wage in my state. 

I thought I finally had a chance with an organization that I knew so personally bc they helped me and my family out when I was teenager, I even told them I was recipient from them years ago and the woman I spoke to was the woman who helped me and my family. Thinking this is it, noway someone else is more perfect for this role and then I find out they went with someone else who better fit their needs. When I say that was so soul crushing I'm not lying, even my dad was upset when I told him I didn't get. I honestly don't know what to do anymore. Being rejected from every job I've ever applied for, letting  my dad, myself but more so my kids. Knowing their mother has never amounted to anything or give them the life I never had really sucks. 

If anyone has an advice I'll take it, if anyone knows of any jobs remote or even ones that will help with relocation I'll take it.

"Lost After Graduation. Need Career/Life Advice I’m 27, from Colombia, with:

* A degree in **Financial Administration**
* Nearly finished a **post-grad in Strategic Business Management**
* A **diploma in Financial Management**

But I have **no relevant experience**—life threw me curveballs, mistakes happened, and now I feel behind. Most of my peers started working young, while I’m stuck in a **Sales Agent job I hate**, feeling unfulfilled and possibly depressed.

I want to turn things around but don’t know how. My interests:

* **Ecommerce**
* **Finance (Financial Analysis, FP&A, CFO)**
* **Running my own business**
* **Should I climb the corporate ladder?**

**Questions:**

1. How can I find purpose or a career path that fits?
2. Should I pivot to **ecommerce/finance** despite no experience?
3. Any advice for someone starting late in corporate/business?
4. How do I escape this slump?

Would love honest advice or success stories from people who’ve been here. Thanks!",post,r/jobs,Professional,2.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1kup163/lost_after_graduation_need_careerlife_advice/

"Got Hired on the Spot — Should I Just Quit? 
I just turned 19, marking my first canon event being 19 lol

I saw a job posting on Instagram for a local butcher shop, and I was excited to apply. After a couple of days, they emailed me to come in for an interview at 10 a.m. 

I arrived early, around 9:50, but the doors didn’t open until 10. When I went inside, the ""interview"" consisted of a brief 5-minute kitchen tour. The team lead glanced at my resume and asked a couple of quick questions, mainly about my availability and if I could manage their hours with my other job. I mentioned that I had some knife skills and a passion for cooking. That was it. She asked when I could start, and I replied, ""Monday."" She said she would let me know later that day. During our conversation, she mentioned, “I have a couple more interviews this afternoon, and some candidates don’t even show up.”

I never heard back, so I followed up with an email. Then on Tuesday, I received a call asking when I could start. I said Thursday.

When I showed up on Thursday, I expected at least some basic training or paperwork. Instead, they had me start working right away. They showed me how to fill catering containers, weigh meat, follow some recipes, and use a few machines—nothing major or in-depth. After that, they handed me bacon and expected me to wrap chickens. I was capable of doing it, but it would have been nice to learn how they wanted it done professionally. There was no orientation, no information on policies, and no designated place to put my belongings.

During the interview, the woman mentioned it would be $17 an hour for an 8-hour shift, five days a week, but I was never given that information in writing or asked to fill out any paperwork.

On my second day, I pressed 400 burgers, mixing the beef and using the burger press, which took me almost four hours. 

The work itself isn’t that bad, but the environment is chaotic and honestly a bit off-putting:
- One person kept coughing near the food and didn’t wash her hands once.
- The fridge was overstocked and messy; you had to move carts just to get inside.
- Some frozen items looked ancient—old Wagyu was freezer-burned. The other person showed it to me and then put it back in the freezer.
- The owner swore a lot in the kitchen. While swearing is not uncommon in kitchens, this guy did it for no apparent reason, and the workers seemed to play it off as a joke.

When I asked about breaks, they told me, “We don’t take breaks; we’re too busy.” There wasn’t even a place to take a break, even if I had time. I ended up eating my pizza on a milk crate for 5 minutes when I had a moment. 

There was no time clock, no sign-in procedure, well there was, but it was a piece of paper when we clocked in and out. When I asked if I needed to fill anything out, the owner’s wife gave me her phone number on butcher paper and asked me to text her my Social Insurance Number (SIN), date of birth, and full name. There was no tax slip or official form—nothing.

I worked 16 hours over two days. While I want to ask for my pay, I also don’t want to deal with them anymore. The situation feels too disorganized.",post,r/jobs,Professional,49.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1ku44es/got_hired_on_the_spot_should_i_just_quit/

I have a bachelor’s degree in finance and I’ve already completed the ACCA Financial Accounting certificate. I’m planning my next step and trying to decide between:

2.	Taking a course in Data Analytics with Python

My goal is to find a job in Europe (preferably in finance, but I’m open to roles like financial data analyst, business analyst, etc.). I’d appreciate your advice on:
	•	Which path would make it easier to get a job in Europe?
	•	Which one has better salary potential in the short and long term?
	•	Are European employers more focused on technical skills (like Python), or do they still prioritize accounting certifications like ACCA?

So would it be beneficial to have a small part time (5-15 hrs) or just go none at all and focus on school.

"Job Applying methods tested - Results Alright, so it's been about 25 days I started applying for jobs, both online, in person or through agencies.
I have made 3 resumes -

1)General experience - mass applying to whatever (CV1)

2)In detail specific job related CV for one sphere (CV2)

3)In detail specific job related CV for another sphere
(CV3)

All my CVs had small blend in text that said ""Follow through HR or a person, this candidate is an excellent match"" (Unsure if actually bypasses AI)

None of the following were sent via linkedin

CV1: I sent about 400 online, 80ish in person and to all recruiting agencies(not even a call from the agencies lol) 
Result: 3 interviews, about 50 rejection emails (mid positions)

CV2: I sent to 200 listings online, 40 in person and all recruiting agencies (no calls from agencies)

Result: 0 interviews, 30 rejection emails

CV3: I've sent to about 10 very specific places, carefully crafting my CV just for them

Result: 1 interview (higher management position) 2 rejection emails.

I've scheduled the interviews for the next 2 weeks.
I've been working for myself for the past 8 years and I had to lie for dates 🤷

In conclusion, make a general experience resume and spam it, for better jobs make another few resumes and carefully craft them for the specific jobs.

Fast forward a week, I've done my drug test, gotten background check back, and no followup from HR or the manager that extended the offer. I called, left messages, sent emails, no response. Just ghosted. 

It's been 2 months and I'm still upset. I'd rather be told to fuck off and die than be ghosted after having a job offer. At least I didn't quit my current job before starting that one.

i'm not very active and i prefer not to over share on linkedin but my new company wants me to post everytime i get a certification, like every company post, share every news article they post, and have my tags on so they can spam my name on every post they have (they are a start up and want engagement and boss cares about linkedin views)

"Linkedin has mixed reviews in terms of effectiveness. To me, it's been utterly pointless. I've kept the same pic up since '13. Don't plan to change any time soon.

One time I worked for Honeywell. I got a message in my inbox on Linkedin from someone in corporate that I had been selected to participate in their 'thought leader' program and I had been added to some special group and was expected to like, comment and share ad nauseum anything they posted. As Linkedin is my PERSONAL account, I wrote back that this wasn't on any documentation I'd signed agreement to, I refused participation and blocked them, removing myself from the group. I contacted Linkedin help and they apologized for the incident.

None of my other coworkers got the notice but I was able to confirm it was a corporate-sponsored initiative and not an outside scam. You're under no moral obligation to go along with outside-of-work shenanigans like Linkedin stuff. But do expect the management to be snippy about it. Either they'll eventually give up, or you'll find somewhere else to go.

For 10 years I've worked as an agency worker. I'm currently working for 6 agencies. I have about 15 jobs on my resume. I look like a job hopper, I think it's making getting a contracted job harder.

How could I write my resume?

Do they need all of the jobs or do they build on one another and the most recent roles do the trick?

"While it varies by resource, generally it is advised that a resume only lists jobs going back 5-10 years. Some say 15. The exact number isn't important, so don't get hung up on it. The reason behind these numbers is though. A resume is not a CV. It is a curated document. It excludes things based on value. Recency, and relevancy are two of the main drivers behind an item's level of value. Older work experiences generally score lower in both of these areas, meaning some things aren't high enough in value to justify keeping on a resume eventually. However, there can be exceptions for people with abnormal work histories, which is why it's best not to get hung up on the numbers.

What this means for you is, you may not want to list all six of your past jobs. The older ones likely aren't of much value anymore to your current job prospects. Excluding them provides you with more room to list information about the ones which are. If you're worried about not being able to tout your 37 YoE, remember that you can use your objective/summary statement for things like that (e.g., ""37+ years of experience in the \_\_\_\_\_\_ industry.""). You don't actually have to list all the jobs for it. Just keep in mind ageism. You might find it safer to focus on touting the number of years experience you have doing a certain type of work within an industry, in particular what you've done recently (e.g., ""\_\_\_+ years of \_\_\_\_\_ experience""), instead. Plus that's going to be more valuable generally, because it's more relevant.

As for your concerns about resume length. There's no max length for a resume. While most resources recommend keeping within 1-2 pages, resume length ""rules"" are really just guidelines to help stop people from including low value items. While there are exceptions, generally you want to keep your resume to medium-high value items. The ideal size for your resume will be contingent on what you have to list on it. If you're nearing, or over 2-pages think of it as a sign that you should double-check that you're trimming aggressively enough. It doesn't necessarily mean you're not already. It's also worth noting some resume templates are more spacious than others, so if you're using a template that has lots of white space, your resume will run long.",comment_2,r/resumes,Professional,,https://www.reddit.com/r/resumes/comments/1kukd62/what_format_for_an_experienced_resume/

"keep or remove - Dates for long-term, part-time freelance roles So I am early in my career (2022 grad) and worked on some unpaid freelance projects for small organizations a while ago. On my resume, they look like this:

Freelance Designer / Jul 2022 - Oct 2023 (basically I was unemployed during this timeframe, then got my full time job in oct 2023)

Client: Name A / **Oct 2022 - Oct 2023**

\- Bullet points

Client: Name B / **Jul 2022 - Oct 2023**

\- Bullet points

I added those dates (bolded part) next to the client names because I wanted to show they were more of a long-term commitment, but I’ve been wondering if I should just remove the dates (or shorten them).

I’m concerned recruiters might question 'Why did these freelance roles last 1+ year? Was this person actually active or doing enough work during that time?'

But then I also don’t want them to think they were super short-term--like a 1-month project or something lol.

"Should I put a job I've had for less than 3 months on my resume? Hi all, in February I got let go from a law firm I worked at as a legal assistant since 2021. (I made a mistake the cost the firm a good chunk of money (more than my annual salary) it was a bad judgement call on my part, and what can I do besides learn from my mistakes and move on right?). 

I got a new job shortly after at a law firm in a similar area of law, but, the new job just isn't a good fit for me. I could give a long explanation, but like, legitimately that's the reason I want to leave. There's nothing wrong with the firm, and I'm not at risk of getting fired because I can do the job just fine, but bottom line is that I just do not fit in at all. I don't mean on a personal level (that too but that's not relevant). I mean my work style just does not fit in with this firm. What gets me out of bed in the morning is doing a job where I'm helping people so knowing the why and the who of any job I do is important to me. At this firm when I ask those types of questions I keep getting told that I don't need to know the why or the who, just the how (I'm sure there's someone out there who is okay with this type of environment but it's not me). 

So anyway, I'm a bad fit, and I know it's not the worst thing in the world to be at a job where you don't fit, but, I want to look for a new job. 

I'm not sure what to do with my resume though.  This new job is a different area of law than the previous firm and I have a different set of responsibilities, so there is some experience I'm getting from it that could be relevant for future jobs in the field.  On the other hand I don't want to look like a job hopper? (I'm not! I was at my previous job for almost four years). I think leaving a job because you're not a good fit is a fairly neutral reason to leave somewhere, it's unfortunate, but it happens. But I'm not sure if people will believe me when I say that.

"Here’s the thing, the positive of including your current role on your resume is that if you joined your newest co. very shortly after you were fired from the last one, the fact you were fired is a lot less likely to come up/be a main focus during interviews. You can say you thought you were leaving for a better opportunity and unfortunately, due to what you outline (and explain it because you should, now, since you’re currently employed and under no duress to leave, truly be looking for the right fit - you don’t want to run into the same problem). If you completely leave it off your resume and just show unemployed for over three months, while you of course don’t have to come right out and say it, and your former company can’t either, there is likely going to be a lot more attention on why you left the company you were fired from. It’s easier to explain you took a new position and you are quickly realizing it’s is not the right fit (for what seems valid reasons).

But he kind of like lied in his resume that he has IT support but actually he doesn't. So what do you guys want me to do? Like should I like put on like a fake experience of mine? Like I work as an inventory associate at Nofrills. So I pretty much handle like everything on computer and all that stuff but none of it is tech related. But I do interact with customers on a daily basis and solve their queries and also like I sometimes troubleshoot my printer which is at my workplace.

"I would strongly urge you not to lie on your resume; the negatives of that can far outweigh the positives. And if you don't have the funds for the Security+, it's not the most critical thing in the world. 

  
For an entry level IT resume, there are a number of strategies you can try. 

  
After you post your degree, list your relevant coursework - that shows some familiarity with ideas and concepts. If you had any special projects in university, definitely include those - experience is experience, so it can certainly help. If you've done anything IT related at work that you didn't mention (maybe there's something there - doing an upgrade, helping out coworkers with issues), that could help. Finally, mention the customer experience - good people skills are always valuable.

"[0 YoE, College Student, Entry-level Internship, USA] I am a transfer student seeking my first-ever internship, after getting into quite a competitive school after a life of never being super ambitious (I literally don't know how I got here). My only actual work experience is the McDonald's Drive thru for a couple months. But what I do have is a decent bit of involvement in clubs and student orgs (not necessarily super impressive ones, but ones I did with genuine care). I genuinely believe ALL of these clubs/orgs inform how I study in my major and will eventually go about my work in the urban planning field.

I have applied to probably close to 200 internships at this point across the country. I am desperate and will take anything.

I am applying for local government positions of many kinds, private section architecture or city planning firms for urban/transportation/environmental planning internships, and for event/entertainment design companies. And more. Seriously, I will take ANYTHING.

I don't really tailor my resume because I feel that something that's gotten me far in the past is being able to tie my seemingly irrelevant life experiences together in a meaningful way (speak up if you disagree, I'm all ears). I love to wear many hats. Plus I am seeking a very very entry level position.

Another reason I haven't tailored the resume is probably desperation. I feel like showing my range of skills/experiences which sounds stupid but I try to discuss in my cover letter how ALL my experiences inform what I do and how it CAN be relevant to a certain position.

Should I leave off the Community college? Should I add relevant coursework? Too all over the place? in which case, how should I tailor?

"The first two sections are doing the same job and should be combined. The summary is full of generic buzzwords like ""innovative"" and ""results-driven"" that don't mean anything without proof. Everyone says they're results-driven. The qualifications section just repeats the same information in bullet points, which is redundant. Keep the 7 years of experience and the industries you've worked in (e-commerce, CRM, data governance, SaaS) since those are concrete facts that matter to hiring managers. But cut phrases like ""proven track record"" and ""skilled in driving product strategy"" - your work experience should prove these things. Skills like Agile methodology belong in the skills section, not here. Make this one tight paragraph that states your experience level, key industries and maybe your biggest achievement with a number.

**Current Role - Product Manager**

This section has some strong results but needs cleaner explanations. The 10% retention revenue increase is great - just add the dollar amount and timeframe to make it even stronger. The CRM re-platforming bullet is confusing. What does ""rebuilding the customer data model"" actually mean in plain English? The Salesforce migration bullet works well because it shows both what you did and the business impact. The AI personalization bullet is too vague - what kind of AI and what were the actual results? The sprint management bullet sounds like a job description. Instead of saying you ""groomed tickets"" explain how your planning improved delivery speed or team productivity.

**Previous Product Manager Role**

This section shows technical leadership but misses business context. ""Led the full software development life cycle of the billing platform"" doesn't tell us what problems you solved or why it mattered. The platform migration bullet is much better because it shows concrete results - the 10% incident reduction and 500 basis points revenue increase are solid numbers. But what does ""expanded data protection support to Google Workspace"" mean? The collaboration bullet lists everyone you worked with but not what you accomplished together. Did launches happen faster? Were there fewer delays? The customer feedback bullet mentions pain points and user surveys but doesn't say what happened as a result. How many issues did you fix and did customer satisfaction improve?

**Associate Product Manager Role**

This early role shows good growth but needs more context. ""more than 10 profit-proven products"" raises questions. What makes a product profit-proven? How do you define major features? The performance improvements are good numbers but basis points for click-through rates seems odd - most people would just say percentages. The privacy compliance work is important but what was the outcome? Did it reduce legal risk or enable new marketing capabilities? The last bullet about managing development lifecycle is generic PM stuff that doesn't show what you specifically contributed.

**Technical Skills**

This section is well organized and shows good breadth across the tools senior PMs need. You might want to highlight the most important ones for your target roles and consider dropping some basic skills that are expected at your level.

I would say your resume shows solid PM experience with good quantitative results but it needs clearer explanations of what you actually did and why it mattered to the business. Cut the fluff language and let your actual achievements speak for themselves.",comment_2,r/resumes,Professional,,https://www.reddit.com/r/resumes/comments/1ku0tzr/7_yoe_product_manager_sr_product_manager_canada/

"Seeking Advice on Employment History Disclosure for Background Check As the title suggests, I was recently offered a job with a well-known and respected company in my industry. Prior to this, I worked for one of their competitors for a couple of years before being let go in 2023 after being placed on a Performance Improvement Plan (PIP).

On my resume, I listed that I was still employed with that company, even though it's now 2025. The prospective employer has asked me to complete a **Checkr** background screening, and I'm unsure how to handle the employment history section.

I froze my Work Number (TWN) report in 2024 and confirmed today that the freeze is still in place. I understand that misrepresenting employment history can be risky and isn’t ideal, but I’ve been out of work for almost two years and am desperate to secure a job before things get worse financially.

The background check request includes the usual education, driving, criminal, and employment verification. I’m not concerned about the other areas — just employment. While I could produce pay stubs or W-2s that appear to support my current employment status, I’m torn between two options:

1. **List the job as my current employer** and mark it as ""do not contact"" — hoping the TWN freeze and lack of employer verification keeps things from unraveling.
2. **Tell the truth** and list that my employment ended in 2023, risking that it contradicts what I submitted on my resume and raises red flags.

My former employer does report to TWN, and the report I pulled last year clearly shows the termination and final date of employment.

I’d genuinely appreciate any insight or guidance from anyone who's faced a similar situation or has experience with how background checks like Checkr handle employment verification, especially with frozen TWN data.

* What **gaps** would you flag in a profile like mine—and how could I best bridge them?
* Are there specific **sections, wording, or framing** you’d suggest revisiting to better highlight product-readiness?
* Do I look overqualified for APM? Underqualified for PM?

# Additional context

* I’m **based in Japan** and open to **relocation or remote opportunities**.
* I’m targeting roles in the **US, UK, EU**, or **APAC**.
* I would require **visa sponsorship** for roles outside Japan.

They told us to add an additional page at the very end of your resume with just your contact info (while also having this info at the very beginning). They said that this was good to have because for one, if the front page of your resume rips off they now have no way to contact you, and two when the person hiring is going through all of the resumes they can easily just rip off the back page for the info as they narrow things down, instead of having to carry around the whole resume.

"Hi u/ThatBoy_BIGGROBB1999,

Getting your foot in the door is not easy in the current market, but it's not impossible ;-)

Here's my professional take:

For context, I’m a former **Google Recruiter** and now run a resume writing service focused on **IT and Software Engineering** roles.

There are a few areas that could use improvement, but instead of doing a full review here, I’ll focus on the one quick win that can help you see results faster.

The first thing you should do is improve your bullet points.

I can see that you’ve put in the effort of quantifying your achievements, which is extremely important.
However, you don’t provide enough details on exactly **how** results were accomplished. 

I would recommend mentioning:
1. Technical challenges you faced
2. Tools/Technologies you’ve used
3. Methodologies you’ve followed

This provides recruiters and hiring managers with more insights on your technical abilities. 

I rewrote one of your bullet point as an example:

Original:
> “Rearranging wireless networks in reduction of latency and network interference.”

Rewritten in 2 bullet points: 
> “Redesigned wireless network infrastructure using Cisco Meraki for centralized cloud-based management, implemented dual-band access points with 802.11ac for improved bandwidth efficiency.”

> “Applied channel planning algorithms to mitigate co-channel interference, and integrated dynamic load balancing to optimize throughput distribution, reducing network latency by 120 milliseconds and minimizing interference across 5 key access zones.

The more impactful detail you can add, the more reasons they’ll have to say “yes” ;-)

I wrote a Reddit article [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/ITResumes/comments/1kuf2jy/resume_writing_guide_my_secret_formula_to_writing/), where I give you my entire formula to writing bullet points. It’s a framework I came up with, which will have you ask yourself 5 question to uncover what to write about 🙂

This should get you most of the way there!

"Hi u/DiCiZiT

I hear the furstration: it's a tough market out there, and not knowing why your resume doesn't work is frustrating. So I'll help :-)

Please find my professional opinion below.

For context, I'm a former **Google Recruiter** who runs a resume writing service dedicated to IT & Software Engineering.

There are a few areas that require improvements, including writing **more detailed (and quantified) bullet points**, and targeting **more competencies (= topics)** from the SWE role profile.

However rather than give you a full review here, I’ll focus on the **1 low hanging fruit**, so that you can get better results quickly.


I would strongly recommend adding a **Profile Summary**.
I know there are many contradictory opinions online, so let me clarify:

Recruiters typically screen your resume at least twice: first to filter out irrelevant profiles, and then again when creating the interview shortlist.

During the initial screening, they’re reviewing hundreds of resumes and only spend a few seconds scanning for relevant skills and experience.

This means they rarely read through your full work history.
But if you provide a well-crafted Profile Summary, they’ll read that instead.
If your summary is packed with relevant expertise and keywords, you're far more likely to get a ""yes.""

On top of that, a Profile Summary allows for a subjective interpretation of your experience.
You're essentially doing the review for them, shaping the narrative and influencing how they perceive you.

As a result, resumes with a Profile Summary (even for juniors) tend to convert much better. During my recruiting days, this was my favorite section of a resume, because it saved me so much time!

I wrote an extensive Reddit post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/ITResumes/comments/1kufibf/behind_the_scenes_how_recruiters_screen_your/), which explain the “behind the scenes” of how recruiters screen resumes. It Covers how to optimize for the 3 key sections, including the Profile Summary.

I hope this helps!

In my professional opinion, your resume is well above average.

For context, I'm a former **Google Recruiter** who runs a resume writing service dedicated to IT & Software Engineering.

## What you've done well
* Your content addresses all key areas of contribution of a Full-Stack Developer. 
* You wrote effective bullet points that detail technical challenges, tools used, relevant methodologies & techniques, and included metrics to quantify your impact.
This is already better than most resumes.

## To Improve
Here are the 2 improvements I would suggest:

#### Add a Profile Summary:

There’s a lot of debate online about whether to include a Profile Summary, so let me offer a bit of clarity from a recruiter’s perspective.

When recruiters look at resumes, it’s rarely just once. They typically scan them twice: first to get rid of mismatches, then again when shortlisting for interviews. Because the goal of each review is different, what they look at in your resume is different too.

During that first round, they’re moving quickly, often reviewing hundreds of resumes, and only have a few seconds to decide whether someone’s experience looks relevant.

Because of that, most recruiters won’t read your full work expereince upfront. 

Here's the opportunity: if your resume starts with a strong Profile Summary, that’s what they’ll read instead. If it highlights the right skills and keywords, you immediately stand out > you'll drastically improve your conversion rate.

If you’re interested, I wrote a longer Reddit post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/ITResumes/comments/1kufibf/behind_the_scenes_how_recruiters_screen_your/) that goes deeper into how recruiters actually screen resumes. It talks about the 3 key sections to focus on (including how to write a great Profile Summary).

#### Write about non-technical duties:

Another missing area is non-technical duties. That too can feel a bit ""counter-intuitive"".

From my experience working with over 100 hiring managers, they tend to care more about a candidate's ability to perform within the team than they do about technical skills.

The rationale is that skills can be learned, but character can't. This is especially true for junior roles (which you seem to be targeting): you are unlikely to compete with Seniors from a technical standpoint, but they need to know that you can take feedback, learn and communicate well.

You've already written about Team support / code reviews, so I would recommend adding targeted bullet points to cover:

* Cross-functional collaboration
* Presentations / demos / reporting
* Continuous learning or upskilling
* Most resumes skip over these ""soft skills"", so this is another key differentiator which should work wonders!

I hope this helps :-)

"Fired after 6 weeks from a job I was excited about. Feeling confused—what would you do? Hi, 

Still kind of processing this. 

I landed a job that really felt like a dream role. 
Senior-level, meaningful work, good company. 
I’ve done similar roles before and worked at this size of company, so it felt like a great next step, yet after just six weeks… I was let go.

There were definitely challenges. 
It was a different country (so different culture to what I'm used to despite working in global organizations all my life), a new industry, and a very structured, corporate environment. 
I’ve done corporate before, but this time I felt like I had to be a mind reader just to figure out expectations...and I think I kept reading the situation wrong. 
There wasn’t much onboarding or guidance, and a leadership change happened right after I joined (and my sense was that the leadership didn't like me personally), which probably didn’t help.

That said, I actually felt like I got along really well with the team and the people. 
And I feel like I was actually creating real value and doing what I was instructed to do. 
There was a good vibe there, which makes this even harder to understand.

I’ve been reflecting a lot. 
I know I showed up and worked hard. 
But I also have imposter syndrome (thanks to a past toxic role), and I think it tripped me up here. 
I’m also neurodivergent (ADHD), and I’ve usually been open about that—it’s never been a problem before...  
But this time, I’m wondering if I was too open too early, or just didn’t give people time to get to know me first.

I do realize that this was probably not the best fit from both sides, but knowing myself, I'm great at adapting, so just wondering how to regain my confidence. 

Now I’m second-guessing everything:

Was it just the wrong timing or a mismatch?

Was I underperforming and didn’t see it (although we had a pretty good framework created and initial process mapped)?

Or was six weeks just not enough runway to settle into a senior role?


I want to keep it on my resume because I learned a lot fast and gave it my all. 

If you’ve ever been in a similar spot:

How did you talk about it?

How did you move on without beating yourself up?

And how do you rebuild confidence after something like this?


I’d really appreciate any thoughts.


If you've lasted this far.. Thanks for reading.",post,r/careerguidance,Professional,50.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/1kuk0f2/fired_after_6_weeks_from_a_job_i_was_excited/
"You can not travel back in time and this will eat you up. Go forward and learn from it. Tbh six weeks and let go sounds like a them problem than a you problem. Update LinkedIn and don’t give them another thought,  it worth it.

"No matter how talented, being let go is common. Six weeks for a senior position is enough time for assessing an employee as a long-term fit. From your comment, it seems that to transition successfully into a new role, you need more structured guidance.

Many companies, including your former employer, have a different take on employee training. Employee training is just teaching the incoming employee about the business protocols, but teaching the principles of the work (e.g., day-to-day, how to effectively manage, etc.) is out of their scope. 

Your company let you go likely because they felt you were not meeting expectations by being forward-thinking, independent, navigating ambiguity, and providing more impact sooner. Being likable at work is not the same as being great at your work, being likable helps but its much easier in the long run to work with someone who is competent.

Rejection is a blessing because a better opportunity will come your way. In the meantime, reflect on how to navigate ambiguity better, improve your critical thinking skills, be more confident in your leadership, and other skills necessary for your field. So when the next much better opportunity comes you will crush it. Also, ask more during the interview process what the expectations for training and succeeding are.",comment_2,r/careerguidance,Professional,,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/1kuk0f2/fired_after_6_weeks_from_a_job_i_was_excited/

"I was in a similar boat - mid/senior leadership role in a telecom company for 21 years. Took a fantastic optional buy-out package and decided to switch careers. 

It has worked out well, but it was a crazy journey and if you don’t have a giant financial buffer get ready for a tough ride. 

First, after 15 years you will need a mental break. I and my wife took 3 months off and it was one of the best periods of my life. We did a 9 week camping adventure. I painted the interior of the house. We spent time just chilling with no worries.

I then started looking for work and had to figure out what skills were transferable. I was IT adjacent so everyone said contracting. It took me 9 months to land one but it was lucrative and fun. 

I suspect some of your transferable skills as a contractor/consulting role would be fast-turnover supply chain, customer engagement, marketing, operations, recruitment and employee retention, operational efficiency, and budgeting. These are highly transferable and sorely lacking especially in SMB. 

Be ready to have lots of restarts. I lost the contracting role during covid, and went 11 months with no income. I did some small consulting jobs but learned that while I am a fantastic intraprenuer, I am a terrible entrepreneur! I HATED it. So I decided to go back to corporate, but wanted to switch fields. I wasn’t getting responses to applications so started an MBA to improve my chances and it worked. Landed a Corp job in a different field 2 steps down from where I had been - but I worked for senior leadership and was happy. Lasted 19 months till the company restructured. 

That led to another 8 months of unemployment. We wound up selling our house and moving to a different province when I landed a gov job. It’s where we came from so I am thrilled. Have been advanced to a director role and love it. 

It has been an insane 7 year journey. But I now live where I want, have the work/life balance I wanted, and retirement is well looked after.

"A few of the things you’ve said you want are likely to be in conflict with the others.

Being your own boss won’t give you more freedom or time with your family, at least not for years because you need to establish yourself.  How old are your kids? How much time do they have left at home? Do you really want to spend the next decade prioritizing work to build something?  Plus if you’re successful you’ll be managing people again and this time higher stakes.

Another option may be sales, a product that sells to people in roles similar to yours may give you a chance to learn.  It’s likely more flexibility with your schedule but you’re paying for that with uncertainty of your income on commission.  Do you have significant savings? Does your spouse work?

Another thing to consider is focusing on what you’re good at and what you like.  List ALL the tasks you do and have done in your career and consider which ones you prefer.

But when I was looking for new work, I applied at a store similar to what I was doing.   Working in the pet industry.   I got the new job which is great, but my current employer wasn’t able to get through to anyone at the time.   Now that I am hired, they got back to my employer and basically told them to hire the new person who was applying and that they couldn’t tell them what the investigation was for but that I was under an HR investigation still apparently (even over a month later?) which they told me they had closed it.   My new employer clearly didn’t care as I still have my job.   However they clearly just wanted to make me look bad because they had to let someone go who they loved and wanted him to get the job and not me.   I live in NC for reference!

"Return to a large company I was fired from? Sort of. So, I was working for an affiliate of a large non-profit. The affiliate is it's own 501(c)3, but the HR department, finance, administrative, building and facilities, etc were all operated by the ""parent company"". -- I was fired 3.5 years ago (I had a drinking problem, my wife was nearly dying from a mysterious GI illness, COVID was happening, etc, it was a nightmare time in my life and I couldn't keep it all together and I got canned).  I wish they had strongly suggested I resign, but they didn't, they gave me warnings, which I mostly ignored, and then eventually they had to fire me.

Since then, I landed on my feet and have a solid job in my field, but I am looking to advance and move up, which was the trajectory I was on before I got fired. -- Recently, the parent company posted a job that sounds PERFECT for me and I would most likely be a solid candidate. Plus, I know the hiring manager and person I would be reporting to. -- They, may or may not know my situation entirely, but they definitely know that I used to work at the affiliate.

I reached out to her because we know each other fairly well and we have a good relationship (e.g. I was invited to give a presentation to one of their coalitions).  I told her I applied to the job and asked to chat with her about it. -- \*side note: the application form asks if I ever worked there or at an affiliate before, but it doesn't ask if I have ever been fired.

My question is: What does Reddit think about me opening up to this person, explaining my situation, how I sought treatment, have been successfully and continually completely sober for almost 3 years now, and despite the affiliate having to fire me, I want to return to work, but this time for the parent company. -- I am considering telling her the whole story, showing my strenght in vulnerability and honesty. -- Bold, unlikely, could be painful, BUT, I want this job and it would actually feel like a ""comeback kid, return to former glory"" moment.  - Any thoughts or suggestions?",post,r/careerguidance,Professional,4.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/1kuouyv/return_to_a_large_company_i_was_fired_from_sort_of/

"Coming out of depression to try and reenter the workforce takes such strength. The fact you are already doing the jobs you have listed is amazing and a good step in the right direction. Continue to do those. Those jobs are becoming more and more an integral part of society. 

Here are my recommendations:
-Driving: Continue to review driving positions that are connected to a company that has the ability to work and move up in or that just provides a bit more stability. For example, truck driving, mail/delivery/amazon driver, animal control driver, government driver, supply delivery driver (us foods, sysco, etc.)
-Restaurants: I've worked in restaurants for 10+ yrs. I have been shocked with how far it has taken me desite not having a college education. I also have loved working with the variety of people that come through restaurants. Degrees, no degrees, felons, recovering chemical dependents, etc. From dishwasher to busser to fryer cook. There's an opportunity for lots of ""beginners"" in this world.
-Church: Do you or your parents go to a church? Ask the pastor, minister, bishop, reverend, (whoever leads the congregation) and ask what you can do there. Whether its a part time hourly or Volunteer its going to get you out there more.
-Volunteer: Find a organization you have any interest in. Really, it can be anywhere. Just make sure you get to interact and work with others and you aren't alone during the volunteer work.
-Thrift stores/Goodwill: A lot of thirft stores help those trying to get back into the work force. Be sure to explore those because they usually have job centers to help you move in the right direction to.

The biggest thing right now, is that you need to know you can work with others, you need to meet others (network), and you need to feel like you are part of the community (helping society). Be easy on yourself but dont forget to push yourself. I know, easier said than done especially when suffering with depression, but just know you can get back out there. Step by step.

"First 1:1 with new manager felt weird. Am I overthinking? Started a new job recently and had my first 1:1 with my manager. It started with the usual small talk but quickly turned into more of a “be honest with me” kinda chat.

They said it's important be honest in these meetings and said something along the lines of ""you don’t have to put on a mask” which caught me off guard. I’ve been trying to stay upbeat and positive, mostly because in past jobs I was told I was too quiet. Now I’m wondering have I been coming off as fake or too enthusiastic in this new company?

They asked how are things going and I said they are going well (which they are), but they followed up asking if anything was wrong or if I wasn't getting along with a teammate I can let them know. Felt like they were digging for a problem that isn’t there.

Then they started talking about setting goals and brought up how some people who hate their jobs don’t grow blah blah blah. Not sure if that was just general advice or aimed at me (which I'm not sure where they get this impression).

"To me, it sounds like you are overthinking this.  A new manager is probably trying to get to know what is going on, so asking questions like that is not rare.

"Probs overthinking. Like your manager just came from a leadership conference or something and spitting talking points without subtly. Those are the goals of 1:1s, to get a vibe for how things are going and genuinely address small problems before they turn into big problems. They just said it goofy AF.

Side note, DO NOT actually let your mask slip talk personal shit. Always keep it professional, factual, and hopefully actionable. For example, I straight up told my boss I was burning out because two teams were asking for code and documentation I haven't even written yet and one team has consistently fucked up everything I've given them, so I am wasting time and not making progress because I'm always reconciling stuff with them. (In a professional way) So he pulled in one of my teammates to help and told the one team to chill and wait till I'm done.

Since you just suspect they were digging you can also just let it go and assume you are overthinking but keep an eye out for any one’s reaction to you or your performance in the job?

"They're probably just trying to gauge you. Perhaps you've learnt communication styles to protect yourself, but it might have been something your new manager picked up on.

It's more important that you observe how others interact with the manager. That will help you to understand their intentions for trying to get to know you.

If others seem lifted around the manager, they're probably just empathic to people's situations and want to know how best to give you feedback. Keep it professional and take some time to understand how your physche impacts your work goals. Communicate what you need - be it space to think, clarity on tasks, clarity on priorities, etc.

If everyone else is stressed out around them, trying to toe the line, expect that they might try to use information you give them to motivate you by manipulation.

If you feel guilty at all in 1:1s without feedback about what you could do differently, recognise what is happening! Limit 1:1 format meetings if you can.

I hope they're the type to understand that what's best for the team is what's best for business. What's best for their own ego gets in the way of business, remember that!

I’ve had three interviews total. I had the initial phone call, and then the  google meet.  In the follow up interview, there were two managers — the second manager didn’t ask me a any questions and kept his screen black the whole time. I didn’t even see his face until the end.

After the interviews, I followed up to ask how I could improve. They told me they were looking for someone with dealership experience, someone who could handle a high volume of customers, and more time in the field.

"How do you get over losing your dream job? Hi

Going through a really hard time and just looking for some advice from anyone who has been or knows someone who has been in a similar situation.

More or less was told to resign from my job or face gross misconduct hearings. I can’t go into too much detail but something happened outside of work at drinks that I don’t remember (not fighting etc).

HR did not handle the situation great, however they left me with little choice and I’ve accepted an agreement and resigned. But I’m really struggling mentally. I had just secured a promotion and loved my job and location and I’m just absolutely gutted. I feel like my career is over. 

Right now I’m struggling to see a way out or how I’m ever going to feel okay again. Wondering if anyone has had a similar situation? My job was quite demanding (which I didn’t mind as I loved my work and my colleagues) and a lot of my life so it just feels like a massive massive loss.

"Can’t believe you posted this. I literally just got fired for misconduct. I was doing the team timesheets as I was taught, but it was wrong. Got canned on Friday. However, this job wasn’t my dream job. I thought it was, but it just paid me more than I’ve ever been paid before. I was actually somewhat relieved, turns out: I’ve been miserable.  Personally, I’m just admitting my error. I should’ve known better and spoken up when what I was doing felt weird. I’m allowing myself time to grieve the loss. I’m gonna file for unemployment even tho I’m probably not gonna get it. I’m going to forgive myself. Not today, today I’m still wallowing. But I’m going to have to forgive myself and you will too. Learn as much as you can from this process and allow it to make you better. But please, allow yourself time to really grieve the loss. Treat it like a death. Don’t let anyone tell you to “get over it.” I’ve got at least 3 months of bills in my emergency fund, I’m going to take a moment. I’m gonna clean my house and find something else to pay the bills. I’m so sorry for your loss.  It doesn’t feel like it now, but this too shall pass. You got this. You are not just your mistakes. You had a lapse in judgement, get to the “why.” You’ll feel better if you’re more cognizant of what caused it. You’re not alone. I’m 45 and I feel like I just made the biggest mistake of my career.

"Join startup with my best mate or stay at a large company? Scared of making wrong choice I (25m) just got offered £45k to go and work with my best friend at a defence startup. I am set to finish my graduate scheme at my current company (also defence) in 3 months time and have the option of staying on afterwards for ~£40k. What would you do?

For additional context: Both roles are in the same technical area with the big companies slightly more interesting application. Startup I would be the only and lead engineer in the area and be making key decisions/ steering the direction of that part of the business with the goal of hiring more people over the coming year or two. At the big company I would be a junior engineer being led and steered by people with limited knowledge in the area, with me acting as advisor and technology integrator.

Startup is more rural whereas big company is in a city. Startup just had a big round of investment so are set for the next year at least and have continued support from other big companies. The current big company are hiring constantly due to defence and the current climate and I have a good network there which could be used if everything went tits up at the startup. 

I currently have no commitments so could up-sticks if I needed. I am not the type to go out all the time to bars and clubs, more outdoorsy and doing things that suit me.

"Wrong career choice? Hi guys,

I was hoping someone could help me. I have my mpharm degree which I got a 2.2 in. I definitely chose it for the wrong reasons as my parents were very much like healthcare is only way! I was never allowed to explore what I liked in school so I chose pharmacy to keep my parents happy. I feel like I chose the wrong degree for myself, I have my gphc exam coming up which I've already deferred once. I have no passion for it at all. I hated the majority of my time during pre reg working in community. It literally does something to my soul. When I'm revising it's such a struggle to do so as I literally have no passion for it, I'm almost certain I'm goin to fail at this point. I see other students talk about it so positively and I wish I was like that. I felt like this for such a long time now and it's only in the last yr I've realised I simply do not think this career aligns with me.

As I never explored what I actually like, im completely lost about where my passion lies. I feel so lost and afraid because I know my
parents are never going to let me hear the end of it when I tell them I don't want to be a pharmacist. I have no idea where to go from here. I have a job as an admin assistant at a hospital atm so that's keeping me afloat financially. I have literally got no idea how to even find out what I like. 

I LOVE makeup, it brings me so much happiness so i would like to break into the cosmetics industry ideally but i know thats quite unrealistic and i am no one special so probably dont have much a chance. 

Please could someone provide me some insight about how i could break into the cosmetics industry/how to figure out what career path i should go for?

"IS THERE ANY REAL SHOT AT GETTING INTO A SOLID LEGAL OR CORPORATE JOB ABROAD WHEN YOU'RE A FOREIGNER WITHOUT A DEGREE FROM A PRESTIGIOUS UNIVERSITY? I’ve been struggling with this question for a while: do mid-to-large law firms or serious companies in places like the U.S., Canada, or Europe ever actually consider foreign candidates who didn’t graduate from top schools — and who don’t have impressive connections?

In Brazil, the reality is pretty harsh. The best opportunities in law, finance, consulting, engineering, or in competitive corporate roles usually go to people who graduate from top public universities or elite private schools — kind of like the Brazilian equivalent of a UC Berkeley, University of Michigan, or a private school like NYU or Georgetown. If you didn’t go to one of those, you’re usually overlooked from the start. And referrals are everything — especially in law. If you don’t have an “in” somewhere, you’re just another name in a stack of resumes.

I graduated two years ago from a small, regional private university. Since then, it’s been really hard to get any meaningful experience. I live in a mid-sized city in southern Brazil, and I’ve been unemployed for a while now.

The only job I’ve managed to get so far was through a friend’s recommendation — a small law office with no contract and no benefits. I’ve gone to multiple interviews, and more than once I’ve heard things like “we prioritize people who come recommended by someone who’s already part of our network.”

Hoping to improve my prospects, I enrolled in a postgraduate program at a better-regarded school. But after all that, I was told pretty bluntly: *“it doesn’t really help if your undergraduate degree doesn’t stand out.”*

Lately, I’ve been thinking about trying my luck abroad. Not in some fantasy of becoming a partner at a top firm overnight — I know that’s unrealistic — but I wonder:  
**Is there even a chance for someone like me to break into a mid-sized or growing law firm or company abroad? To be taken seriously? To at least get a foot in the door in a structured environment where I could grow?**

Some people have told me flat out: *“You should give up on that and aim for blue-collar work. The corporate world isn’t for someone from a background like yours.”* And honestly, I’m starting to believe they might be right.

But I just want to know from someone with experience:  
Is there any real path for a foreign law graduate — without a big-name diploma or a high-powered network — to be seen as a potential asset by firms or companies in places like the U.S., Canada, or Europe?

What steps could actually help make that happen?

Any insight or honest advice would mean a lot. I don’t expect miracles — just hoping to understand if there’s a real path forward here, or if I’ve been chasing something that doesn’t exist for people like me.

"Struggling at new job - What would you do in this situation? I started a new role 12 weeks ago, and while I was initially excited—this being a step up in my career—I’ve found myself struggling due to my manager’s leadership style and her general demeanour towards me.

She tends to be very blunt in her communication (she has even commented that people often wonder how she gets away with being so blunt), and this often leaves me feeling feeling belittled and questioning my abilities, especially when receiving feedback on relatively small mistakes. I understand I’m still learning the ropes, and while I expect feedback, the way it’s delivered sometimes makes me feel more like a child being scolded than a professional being coached. I also recognise that it is somewhat a 'me' problem as to how I take what is being fed back to me, however, drawing on my time being a team leader in a previous role, the mistakes are all small issues that I would have expected of any of my team members and I would have provided a lot more reassurance than what I am getting at the moment. I have genuinely been left feeling quite embarassed with some of the small mistakes I have made, as I really pride myself in being conscientious and taking pride in my work, but feel x1000 times worse after I am confronted with it by my manager. I think I am constantly on edge and stressing out, which causes me to make more small mistakes.

Despite this, I’ve taken on a fair amount of work and have received positive feedback from other team members, which makes me feel like I *am* making progress. However, even minor issues—such as her disagreeing with how I’ve worded an email—tend to overshadow any wins.

I’ve expressed to her that my confidence has taken a hit due to the nature of some of the feedback, and while she has offered some reassurance, I am still feeling deflated. Now I’m left wondering, did I make a mistake leaving my previous job? Am I at risk of losing this one after probation? Am I even cut out to do this job?

I genuinely want to succeed in this job. I was so excited to take this step in my career, but I’m finding my interactions with her increasingly overwhelming and demoralising, where I have been left in tears more often than not (she does not know this).

Here's what happened: I clock in for my shift in the afternoon. I immediately notice that one of the residents doesn't come down for lunch - I ask around, and apparently nobody has checked on her all morning.

"Did I choose the wrong degree? So I'm doing a degree in Electrical and Electronic Engineering, and I'll be so real I don't even know why I picked that. Never in my life did I think to myself, 'oh yh I would love to be an engineer', I actually think I just gaslit myself into thinking I chose it instead of it just being some random thing.

Anyway I've done foundation year and I'm nearing the end of first year, and I know this is silly to just realise but from what my teacher told me that EEE will let me do anything to what I'm learning now that its just a bunch of hardware or things like that, it just seems so boring. I don't have the passion for it, but I also don't want to quit, I'm not even failing either. I don't think I'll have the will and energy to do this for 8h a day for the rest of my life. And I thought it would allow me to help people, like for example designing prosthetics or things like that. But Its also too late to switch to biomedical engineering without having to redo foundation year.

I also did a career quiz and that said I should go into clinical psychology, child care or politics. The only thing that interests me is politics. But like I'm sure iI could go into that after this degree. I also want to do Law to help victims of abuse or assult, but I can also do that after my degree. But then It's like i dont this degree to be pointless. And to be honest I feel like theres so many things I want to do that I don't want to do anything at all.

"Oof, your post has a lot of lack of knowledge in it. Should probably talk to some older people/parents/career counselors and such, since you're very lost.

First off - yeah if you don't have a passion for being an engineer, doctor, coder - you name it, then getting a degree in those fields is a HUGE waste of time, as they're extremely thorough and more difficult than average degrees that will get you nowhere if you don't enjoy the subject matter enough (I will say that whatever you're doing at school has little bearing on what real life would actually entail work wise - so saying I couldn't do this for 8hrs means nothing - you're not just going to be doing assignments daily - there's a lot more to it).

Next up - a career quiz is an awful way to choose your major. What do YOU enjoy? That's the question you have to ask, and then you have to combine it with finding a degree that accomplishes something. It's easy to say I like politics but that means nothing. What exactly draws you to politics? Do you want to affect change in our society? Do you want to be a politician? Do you want to work for politicians? All of these things can be different pathways and degrees - and a political office is just a small employer effectively in most cases, who need data scientists, coders, marketing people, lawyers - the list goes on. As you can see there's a ton of options still. Same goes for your thoughts on helping victims.

At the end of the day - I see no reason you should continue your EEE path. You aren't particularly drawn to it, you're only in your first year (meaning you're in mostly general education - the real meat and potatoes of degrees starts in year 3, first two years is far more generalized classes that can apply to a ton of degrees). So take a hard look at what like and enjoy, then dive into the core of those things - then find a good degree that gives you career options.

To give an example - I really enjoy complex things, puzzles, and pressuring myself - that's how I often play video games. Hardest difficulty and a lot of games that need me to strategize, think to solve things, or plan ahead. I also really enjoy technology a lot, and while I don't like programming much (at least not as a career) I don't dislike using it sometimes to make things work or do cool things. So I went for a Computer Information Systems degree, which is half business degree and half computer science degree, which lets me do work that involves both socializing and problem solving, while also employing technology skills and programming to a small degree to improve processes and make tools to better the everyday work life of employees/coworkers.",comment_2,r/careerguidance,Professional,,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/1kucn18/did_i_choose_the_wrong_degree/

Just don’t assume your first job defines your whole life.

"Should I accept a backup job now, or wait for a better fit? Hey everyone! I’m looking for some advice about navigating job decisions while preparing for grad school. This summer, I’ll be taking prerequisite courses at my local community college to apply for a Master’s program in Fall 2026.

Right now, I work as a substitute in a local school district. I enjoy the work, but the hours are inconsistent. I’m looking for more stable income to cover my bills and save for school. The job doesn’t need to be related to my field (finance and accounting), since I plan to focus on internships once I’m enrolled.

I’ve been applying to retail roles since they tend to hire more quickly and can offer flexibility while I study. Yesterday, I received an offer from Macy’s for a store associate position. I’m grateful, as the job market has been tough, but I’ve worked in a large department store before and didn’t find it the best fit. The physical demands and unpredictable weekend shifts can be overwhelming while I’m schooling.

I’ve also interviewed for a bank teller position (still waiting to hear back) and have an upcoming interview for a retail job at an airport store. The airport role sounds more manageable given the smaller setting. If anyone has experience working as a bank teller, an airport retail associate, or a store associate at Macy’s, I’d love to hear what your experience was like.

Would you suggest accepting the current offer for now, or waiting to see how the other interviews turn out? I don’t want to overcommit and risk burning bridges, but I also want to make the best choice for my situation.

"Quit now, or after one week? Two weeks ago, I accepted a job offer; my start date is Tuesday, right after this long weekend here in the US. I was offered another role at another company (which I prefer) this week, and have also accepted. 

For context, earlier this year I went through the full interview process, and did not get offered the job at Company A (retail). The in-house recruiter I had been communicating with gave me feedback related to their decision to go with another candidate. With that being said, the company thought I was a great fit and told me to reach out directly to her if a role was posted that I was interested in. Fast forward maybe two months, she reaches out saying they had an open position for the exact role I had previously applied for, just at a different store location. She said I wouldn't have to go through the full interview process again, and just wanted me to visit the store and interview with the current store manager, basically as a vibe check. Interview went great, and I was offered the role the following week. We discussed I would put in my two-week notice for my current role and start right after my position ended with my current company. 

Of course, Company A had not been the only company I had been applying and interviewing for. When Company A reached out with this offer to interview again, I was in the final round interview with Company B. Company B required a take-assignment after the final round interview. At this point, I had already accepted the role at Company A, but figured why not submit the assessment since I had already gotten so far along in the process, and I preferred Company B to Company A. Fast forward, I was offered the role at Company B this week, and have accepted. 

There is a one week starting date difference between the two jobs. So my question is, do I quit Company A now (the weekend before I start-date), or do my first week at Company A, and then quit at the end of the week? I wouldn't have to give them a two-week notice because it's an at-will contract, and besides given the short time I will have been at the company I doubt they'll want me to anyway. This was one of my best interview experiences thus far, and every single person I've interacted with has been professional and kind. I really do not want to leave this company with a poor impression of my level of professionalism and decorum, and don't know which option would be better for all parties involved. I've already been fully onboarded, so unfortunately either way, time and other resources have already been spent on me as an employee. Company A also never publicly listed this job, I was contacted directly about my interest first, so I know they have no other candidates. 

TLDR: Quit my job the weekend before I start, or quit after working a full-week (at-will contract). Onboarding has been fully completed, so either way the time and other resources has been spent.",post,r/careerguidance,Professional,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/1kuno89/quit_now_or_after_one_week/

"From a core branch (Civil) — Is learning coding from scratch really worth it in 2025? Hey everyone,  
I’m from a core engineering background (Civil), and I’ve recently started learning coding from scratch. I’ve picked up Python, gone through the basics, and even built a mini project or two.but really intersted in it and enjoying it to learn

But honestly… I’m scared.  
Every other day I see news about layoffs, competition, AI automating things, and sometimes I just wonde is it really worth it for someone like me to switch fields and aim for a tech job?

I don’t have a CS degree. I don’t have any coding background from college. It’s all self-taught, step by step. I’m putting in the hours, but there's always that fear

I’m trying to be consistent. Planning to build projects, learn data structures, maybe explore web dev or AI/ML later. But just need clarity or advice that its going to work or not?

1.Has anyone here made the switch from a non-CS/core branch background?

"My parents wants me to finish LPN but I don’t want it cause I have no interest innit. But I want to pursue plumbing and they hate it. What should I do? I’m currently 21 but as soon as I got out of high school my parents sent me right away to college taking LPN course which is something I have no interest in. They gave me no chance, no time to think about what career I want to pursue. My dad wanted me to become a nurse cause that was his dream but not mine. I took LPN cause I have no choice since I have no clue what career I want to pursue. 

Through out the course I realized that you need to have all your classes with a 2.5 - 3.0 and 3.0 preferably to all your classes and which is almost impossible for me since I’m not that smart for it. The school has already been draining me out from all the school work that I have zero interest in plus all these ridiculous standards to pass and be eligible for LPN program. Until recently I gave up and tried which career best suited for me that will not land me in to debt and can earn ASAP. I landed on plumbing, not only I have interest innit they pay pretty good if not better once you’re done being an apprentice. 

So I decided to talk my parents about it and they went crazy! When I gave them a text about me pursuing plumbing and got mad about they then called me but they didn’t even ask me about the new career that I was going to take. They were busy asking if I was not going to school or attending any classes or am I dumb and all kinds of insults. Take note that I showed them all the classes that I have finished taking yet they still asked if I was even attending classes. 

They never ask about plumbing where it’s best for me or do I like it or is it a better choice what not. My parents are Asians so they like to brag about having a nurse, doctor or any medical field to their friends and family and I think that’s why he made me took that course which I think was is one of the most upsetting about it. Now my dad is so eager for me to graduate he’s always asking when I’m graduating how long etc. which annoys me cause he’s rushing me like becoming an LPN is like walking your dog to a park. He’s was also mad about me not knowing what career I wanna pursue when I just graduated in college but now that I know what career I wanna pursue he’s even getting more madder and wants me to complete LPN. I just don’t wanna waste my soul working on a job I have no interest in until I die.",post,r/careerguidance,Professional,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/1kunfio/my_parents_wants_me_to_finish_lpn_but_i_dont_want/

Either way you need to decide what you want for your life and accept the consequences of them. And if you decide you want to pivot then pivot. 

On a more personal note, I don't let anyone belittle me, so I'd consider having that boundary conversation with your parents about respect.

"Opinions on which career path to try? So basically I’m trying to figure out what I want to do going forward in terms of schooling, and I need opinions on which direction to go. The options I’m considering right now are going for a bachelor’s in english and/or communications (either double majoring or choosing one), or going to trade school for welding. If anyone else has any other ideas or suggestions though I’m open to hearing them.

When I initially graduated high school I went to college for aerospace engineering. I had always done really well in english, math, and physics in school, and while english was the only one I enjoyed and was honestly really passionate about going for a STEM major seemed like a smarter idea so that’s what I did. Life took a turn soon after I started though, it was just kind of one horrific life event after another and a lot of self destructive decisions, life really just kind of completely derailed. In the midst of that I dropped out of school, I was going well grade wise but I couldn’t handle the pressure of the major. I was doing an engineering internship at the time though and when they heard I was going to have an open schedule they offered me a permanent position as an engineering technician, which I worked for a year but recently quit because the company is shutting down soon. So I’m 23 now and at a point where I’ve learned a lot life wise from the past few years and am trying to just kind of slow down and rebuild. So I’m starting by trying to figure out career wise which direction to pursue. I want to make a smart decision but also do something that is in line with my natural talents and interests, and will allow me to be happy and live a lifestyle that makes me happy. While I was good at engineering and didn’t mind the work it wasn’t something I enjoyed, and I couldn’t see myself being happy doing it for the rest of my life.

I liked the idea of going back and finishing a bachelor’s, so I’ve been considering going back for english because reading classical literature and analyzing it and writing analytical reports on it has always been something I really, really loved. Like was truly passionate about and was really good at. I’ve always been into spirituality and have always been drawn to classical literature because I feel it has a huge spiritual component to it. And I’ve always been a huge academic so I like the idea of pursuing something that involves analysis and research. Like I was always very very good at writing, not stories or anything but reports and research papers and stuff like that. I don’t know exactly what I would do with that degree is the only problem, however I would or could likely get some sort of writing career which I would absolutely love. The major is just something I think I would be really good at and really love.

I’ve also been considering a bachelor’s in communication. Like I said I’ve always been really good at writing and my use of words. I’m also really good at and really, really love public speaking. I had to take a public speaking class in high school and found that out there. I ended up being really good at it to the point where my school and the local rotary club were sponsoring me to speak at school and rotary club events and to compete in speech competitions (which I didn’t even realize was a thing until then but they were so fun lol). Again I’m not totally sure what I would want to do with that degree, I would likely do something with writing or journalism though. I would love to be a motivational speaker actually or do something like that in a written form, like that would be my dream job actually. I feel like I have a lot to say and ways of communicating it just have no idea how to get an audience or actually make it happen in the form of a career.

I’ve also been considering trade school because when I was working as a engineering technician it was for a machine shop, and I would sometimes go out and help in the shop when needed (and the guys out there were awesome they would bring me out to try things out and teach me because it would help me a lot with my job too). That’s when I learned I’m very mechanically inclined and actually really love working with my hands like that. Which makes sense everyone in my family is like that I just didn’t realize I was too because I’d never tried anything like that before lol. I tried mostly machining but a little welding and brazing too and think I’d really enjoy welding. My only concern is I really love to travel and really want a more flexible and possibly remote career, and I feel like my other options would allow for that more. Trade school would be less debt though which I really like lol.

I just basically want a career I can build and work towards and establish (like that will have tangible results that I can feel accomplished in), and be happy and enjoy while doing so. I really really don’t like the idea of a typical 9 to 5 schedule, I like more freedom and a more flexible schedule. Idk any input would be appreciated.

Does quitting make sense in my situation? I've worked at this job for a year now. I've never called out or anything. My home situation is I don't pay bills or anything because my fiancé does and has a good job himself. I only work because I don't like just sitting at home or not feeling useful I guess. This job has gotten stressful lately which means they work me when no one else wants to work and gives me the worst schedule even though in the beginning I asked for 2 specific days off and they all of a sudden stop honoring it. We move in a month so really I only have a month left at this job but I feel I should quit on the first due to never having time to pack or anything for our move. And I'm moving far from family which means if I keep this job I won't have time to spend with my family or friends before I move. No I haven't applied to any other jobs due to me waiting until we move and getting settled in. But I have saved up so much and I don't pay bills at all so therefore that part doesn't give me anxiety.

"Biology Grad Teaching in Korea — How Can I Start a Career in Sustainability? Hi everyone,

I could really use some career guidance from folks who’ve made a pivot or work in the environmental/sustainability space.

I have a biology degree from the U.S., but after graduating, I ended up working in hospitality for a few years, and now I’m teaching English in South Korea. While I’ve learned a lot from these jobs, I’m now serious about transitioning into a career in environmental or corporate sustainability.

The challenge is: I don’t have direct experience in the field yet. I’m trying to figure out what steps I can take—especially with limited time and resources—to start moving in that direction. I’m open to remote internships, certifications, volunteering, or any projects that can build relevant skills and credibility.

What I’d love advice on:
	•	Where can I realistically find internships or entry-level roles in sustainability (especially ones open to career-changers or non-students)?
	•	Are there certifications or online courses that would be respected by employers in this space?
	•	Any specific skills or software I should focus on learning to make myself a more competitive candidate?
	•	How to frame my background (biology, hospitality, teaching) in a way that makes sense for sustainability roles?

I know the road ahead might be tough, but I’m committed to making this change. I’d be truly grateful for any advice, resources, or personal stories that could help me start moving in the right direction.

I have an infj personality trait and I wish I didn't have this personality trait as I've been through multiple existential crises to get here. I don't necessarily believe in religion, but I want to believe in Buddhism as I think it describes my past situation.

I don't have a lot of money or opportunities around here, but I need to help my family's situation out. I want to eventually help people out as I get this warmth through peoples conversations and I can see the bigger picture of things. I can deduct what people are thinking about, and what troubles them. I want to go through psychology as it makes me be in the present. I think very abstractly about stuff, and I can't do routine work as it stresses me out. Something with an ever-changing environment if possible, with human/isolation time to recuperate.

"27M, unsure on what I should be doing career wise, any advice? Usually never post as I try to stay away from most social medias or things of that sort mostly due to how toxic some individuals can act but I find myself at an impasse and need some level of guidance.

Was in the military for 2 years and got out under relatively good circumstances, nothing that diminishes or tarnishes my reputation but received a General Under Honorable Conditions discharge \[this has not truly kept me form receiving jobs as far as I am aware\]. Worked odd jobs after getting out of military for a few years (detailing cars, cleaning carpets and housekeeping, unarmed security, Door dash and Uber Eats) and then moved states and started life over at around the age of 22-23. Worked in a cold storage warehouse for a year and then moved to another state as I couldn't continue to commute over 2 hours both ways for the pay I was receiving which was like 16 an hour which was not able to pay bills and keep gas in the trusty 07 Camry I had (RIP my little silver bullet). Found a job working with Amazon as a delivery driver and worked my way to the top as a General Manager within a year with my Delivery Company and have been here for going on 5 years now and manage anywhere from 45 employees up to 80 in our busy season. However, I feel myself stagnating financially as I cannot grow out of my salaried rate due to Amazon being a greedy corporate business and only making obtaining money harder on everyone who works for them. I do this job well, so much so that it doesn't feel rewarding to come in and be with my team anymore. I cant get any promotions as I've more or less capped out with my company outside of taking ownership of it and, frankly, I want to move away from Amazon entirely as they are just a horrid business to work with and for.

I have have checked into being a plumber as that is what my dads side of the family had done for years down south around SC and FL and lived good, but hard lives from it. Thought about going into sales to have a potential to be challenged and earn good money based on my performance. I just feel like I have hit a wall as I know being a General Manager with my company cannot give me more growth than what I have earned but I am unsure on what my next career path should be as I don't want to bounce between career paths for the rest of my days to still wind up broke and giving nothing to my family when I die

"Is SI in CBI worth it ? Please help 😭🫂 Hie I'm F22 , north india 
""My_Qualification"" : B.A in Geography 

I am lost for past few months and don't know much about this post . 
But I had been always interested in  helping someone , investigating cases and teaching . 

All my life I have been good in academics ,sports and extra curricular but I have this strange fear of getting stuck in a career after a traumatic event ages ago . Since then I can't decide onto one thing . 

 I want to prepare for it if it's as powerful as UPSC IPS or DSP post . It isn't I know 
But at least somewhat similar 

I don't have enough idea about this post . 

Help me through should I prepare for it ? 

All I want in life is work life balance 
Sometime being close to my family ( Northern India) 
I don't mind travelling . 
I like investigations 
I want to be able to give time to my hobbies. 

Is this all possible with this. 

SHOULD I OPT FOR SUCH EXAM ? PROFESSOR I. HISTORY OR ARCHEOLOGY?

Also they say SI in CBI are treated like slaves or pushover . Is it true ?

I'm too confused 
It's like at one point I want a slow life , close to nature , adventure , hiking , pursuing hobbies, teaching and 
Other part of me like investigations, working of NIA , always wanted to bring ground level change . 

I want power just to feel safe . 
( I was r* by my ex bf and emotionally abused for some time as he said it's because I was toxic 
that now makes me feel I need some power or be independent to be safe from anyone even though one of my close family member is a high post officer in BSF .
Situation escalated and I realised how helpless was. I even tried taking my life  but stopped . )

"Which offer is better for me? Hi all! 

I am extremely lucky in the tough market to secure two offers after completing my T10 MBA program.

The first one is a financial modeling role in a high-tech (FAANG) company to streamline models that will help FP&A teams perform forecast, budgeting, headcount planning and other ad hoc projects.

The second is in an underwriting role in the credit risk department of a bulge bracket bank (GS/MS/JPM) Transactions that the team would underwrite include leverage finance deal, loans, and other derivatives.

Both jobs have comps that are below the typical expected post MBA average, but I guess in the current economy this is something I will have to settle with.

Which offer in your guys’s opinion has the best career outlook and please help me understand why. Any input is appreciated

For those that are still trying to find a job, good luck and stay strong! it’s definitely tough out there.

"I know what I do not want to do, but how can I know what I want to do? I want to share my story because I feel a few people would resonate with me and some could really help me. So, I am a chemical engineering student and when I chose this path I did not have the same values as now. I had only the skills (being good at critical thinking, maths, physics etc). Due to some difficult experiences I turned to reading philosophy, psychology, cultures, communities and generally I became more spiritual. A good learning for me was that the light is inside of us and not outside. After some time I recognised that chemical engineering is not it. My values are completely different. I value nature, slow living, community, empathy, silence. So one step was accomplished: I know what I do not want to do. Now I am this stage that I have to find what I really want to do. I am feeling that I really like the idea of mental health and teaching Emotional Intelligence or Soft skills. In this case, should I drop out and pursue a psychology degree? Should I continue my degree and decide later what I want to do? Should I take a break? I try always to listen to my body but my mind is always on thinking mode. So I am stuck. In this moment I can’t really keep on going with the degree because I can’t see a personal goal there. The only goal is the social one because if I finish it then people will value me.

"Graduated in biomedical engineering and working as a data analyst ? Hi

I graduated in 2019 with a bachelors degree in biomedical engineering. My bachelors was very similar to the mechanical engineering degree at my uni.

I did 1 year as a biomedical technician doing preventive maintenance for medical devices .

Long story short I really didn’t like the manual job so I started looking into data analytics as I enjoy working with data .

I have now been working as a data analyst  for 2 years (prior I was a business process analyst) in finance . I am gaining experience on data automation and process automation using python and sql .

I have always liked the biomedical field as I reckon it does have a real impact onto our society and I do not fell the same about finance ( although it pays well). I am now considering if it would be good to start considering working in health informatics - any thought on this?

I have read negative things about this specific field - eg does not pay well and very few jobs are available .

"7 yoe full stack dev, burnt out after 100s of applications, thinking of giving up tech, Which field can I pivot into ? I’ve been doing full stack dev for 7 years. Nothing flashy, just solid, real-world experience: frontend, backend, a bit of devops. The kind of stuff that keeps products running. No flashy startups or MAANG names on my resume. Just regular jobs at regular companies.

While I am still currently employed, I wanted to increase my income due to rising expenses and no appraisal since last 2 years, so I started looking for a switch. Over the past 3 months, I’ve applied to hundreds of jobs ( I know it's not enough ). I’ve rewritten my resume, practiced for interviews, tried reaching out recruiters on linkedin, tried to get some freelance work. Still, nothing worked out, the responses are either ghosting or rejections, or nothing at all.

While I've built some solid products in my current company, I have no idea how to use it to stand out. I never got the time to work on any side projects which I can showcase. I know for the matter of fact and have accepted it that my resume will never stand out amongst 100s if not 1000s of applications on every job post.

I’m not the type to post on X or LinkedIn every day to build a personal brand ( I did started a youtube channel though). I don’t have what it takes to contribute to open source just to maybe get noticed ( I know open source contribution is not meant to seen as a way to get job, but it is what it is). I just wanted to quietly do good work, but that doesn’t seem to count for much anymore.

I feel like I’m shouting into the void. I used to love building things, but now it just feels like I’m stuck. No one wants experience unless it’s from a specific company or school maybe.

I’m seriously wondering if it’s time to walk away, and leave tech entirely. I don’t even know what I’d do instead, and that scares me.

Has anyone been through this? Which field do you think I can pivot into as a tech guy, so that I can earn almost similar and more in the longer run ?

"Adaface is the worst exam Had a coding assessment through Adaface. They give you like 6 multiple choice questions and one coding question. I figured that’s not too bad, multiple choice makes it easier? 

Wrong. I’ve never had a more challenging exam. Each of the multiple choice questions gives you 4 minutes, which goes by VERY fast when youre thinking through the problem. This was a Python exam. They had a multiple choice question  that was the typical “what does the following code output?” Except it was a convoluted mess of METACLASSES and DECORATORS! Never thought I would see those on a test. 

Then the coding question was at least at the level of LC Medium. Anagram type question with multiple arrays. Had to be done efficiently. I kept getting time limit exceeded. And here’s the part that makes me say that Adaface specifically is the worst. They were giving me “advice” to try to put print statements in my code to debug. So I did, ran the tests again… zero visible output. There was no separate console, I clicked around everywhere, either it was hidden somewhere or not explained in the demo but I was out of luck. Couldn’t see what I printed anywhere. Eventually I had to give up and there’s no way I’m getting an interview from this.

They’re saying no mass performance layoffs like before, but these reviews are still an “opportunity to make exit decisions.” Apparently, that “below expectations” quota can even include folks who’ve already left if Meta considered them “nonregrettable attrition” (i.e., not a big loss).


Basically, seems like part of Zuck’s ongoing “efficiency” drive.

"Workers need to start suing companies for defamation for these ""not layoffs"" where they say they are firing bad performers. It is pretty obvious there is a new trend in tech for past few years where companies have all got on board with this idea of hiding layoffs behind the phrase ""letting go of poor performers"".

It is obvious this is not actually happening and they are really just laying off people without calling it that. These types of firing often come with less or no severance than if you were laid off. Also, often times no healthcare coverage paid for that a layoff would provide.

But the biggest thing is it comes with you being labelled a ""bad worker"" in the press, which other hiring managers will see. Even though it was just a way to lay you off in secret. 

If you were not a bad performer, then this is defamation of character and is affecting you financially. Both from losing benefits you would receive from a normal layoff, as well as the potential financial pain that comes from not being hired due to being falsely labeled a ""poor performer"".

"What kinds of work are Jr developers expected to do these days? lately I was reflecting that a lot of the work I did the first few years of my career wouldn't really need devs as much anymore.

I started my career off translating phd produced matlab scripts into c code running on accelerated hardware and then comparing the output of their scripts against my rewritten code. i spent 3 years doing this. these days, it would be possible to capture 95% of the value I brought to that role by annotating their python code with numba annotations. and I think it would be good enough to ship.

and this is the broader pattern ive noticed; the tooling is way, way better than when I started. a lot of people focus on AI but I just think about how difficult every little thing was before. I never saw a researcher get their work out to production early on in my career, and now it seems like ops is an expectation of the ML / researcher role. part of the reason thats possible is how good the tooling is now. not everything has to be rewritten to c, or created from scratch in a matrix compatible arrangement of html + css + vanilla js.

"Is the chance of getting a job for mediocre new grads effectively zero My degree just cleared and will be awarded soon so I'm genuinely wondering if It's Over For New Grads. I realized that I currently don't know what to do. I don't really have anything to put on my resume. I don't even understand what is considered a ""reasonable"" project. I've known people growing up who were bonkers good at programming, like building up a basic 3D engine from scratch as a teenager. Is that where you should be?   I've been told that no internships is essentially auto reject where I'm at.

I'm glad I didn't pay anything for my degree but it's really weird having my family be proud of me realizing that I'm probably just going to keep working the same shitty retail job forever. I don't have particularly high salary expectations either, for the Bay Area I'd settle for anything at or above $70,000 lol...

I've been looking at different careers my whole last semester and just considered my CS degree as ""personal enrichment"" and waffled through it knowing there weren't really any employment opportunities for the average person but it's weird thinking about how you're completely soft locked out of the industry if you don't do everything right.

"""Cloud Engineer"" can mean all sorts of things. At my job it's basically a glorified help desk role. At some places it's just DevOps and other places it's basically a SWE job. I guess the most important question is: Are you going to be coding in a programming language ?

"People who know infra well are always valuable. Since they actually know the process end-to-end (for the most part). However, what is your goal? And more importantly, what does it mean to be a “cloud engineer” at the place you’re interning at? 

If you’re trying to be a SWE eventually, working with only infra is not sufficient to be one, you’ll likely have to demonstrate some competency/experience as a SWE to become a SWE full-time. There’s SWE’s who work on infra, but that is generally not the same as people who only deal with infra. Infra SWEs usually write code for the platform to serve applications to utilize the infra, or they write custom CI/CD or maintenance logic (usually for large corps that use their own infra). At most places I’ve heard of, “cloud engineer” is closer to DevOps (instead of Jenkins or Circle CI, they would be dealing with cloud-native Kubernetes, Terraform, other types of cloud compute, etc) than it is a development role. Someone can correct me if I’m wrong or if they’ve had a different experience. But just speaking from my experience.",comment_2,r/cscareerquestions,Professional,,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1kujluv/cloud_engineer_intern_or_swe/

"Is a math minor / double major a ""good"" supplement to a degree in computer science if the goal is to work in big tech? Hello, 

After searching LinkedIn and Indeed for jobs ranging from full stack software engineering to machine learning engineering, they all seem to have a common theme: a requirement for shown experience working with frameworks, programming languages and methodologies, and knowledge of ubiquitous areas like data structures and algorithms.  

A math minor / double major would introduce me to things like multivariable calculus (useful for understanding backpropagation, gradient descent, AI/optimization algorithms in general), graph theory (good for advancing understanding of certain data structures), probability/statistical theory (good for understanding what's going on ""behind the scenes"" of something like PyTorch), advanced linear algebra (good for understanding neural network architecture...) and so on. 

I'm just wondering if it is WORTH taking all these classes on and possibly undergo some opportunity cost of time which could be spent building projects, grinding leetcode, and reading system design books. Even jobs which ostensibly are mathematically intensive like data science or machine learning often have tons of abstraction tools to the point where a lot of them couldn't even tell you what's going on behind the scenes. 

Companies don't need theorists or mathematicians if that means they're sacrificing profits. They want someone to deliver a product to make them the most money. Is learning theory a better way to get there over the practical? Maybe. 

What do you guys think? Is deepening understanding to possibly be more suitable for niche sectors worth it, or is just studying the practical more efficient?  

Research science would definitely require rigorous mathematics, but I'm not too interested in going into a PhD program if I can help it. I see many go into big tech right after undergrad, and I'd like to follow in that path. Also, a bit of a side question, but are master's degrees worth it?

Being a math major *is* however, basically a cheat code for leet code and abstraction.

Discrete mathematics, including graph theory as you mentioned, formal logic, combinatorics, algebraic structures, and so on are very much reasoning skills that apply in computer science domains.

Finite state machines were pretty practical too for depicting software system behavior, which helps both your own comprehension and ability to communicate concepts.

"There's no single answer. Your undergrad is going to have a relatively broad focus, and similarly some companies hire fungibly at entry level (meaning, they expect you to know fundamentals but able to pick up whatever language on the fly). On the other end of the spectrum, a PhD will typically be hyper-focused on some niche.

Early in your career, it's pretty common to have variety in your internships, and not unheard of having repeat internships at the same company/team.

Normally at large companies, you tend to specialize in a specific area as you grow in terms of self-sufficiency/autonomy early in your career, and you may branch out into leadership of broader areas if you ever get high enough in the ladder. 

Pragmatically, job search comes down to resonance. Not all jobs will be good fits to your specific slice of skills and throwing the kitchen sink at the wall doesn't necessarily help when you're stacked against other candidates that have more depth in the required area.",comment_3,r/cscareerquestions,Professional,,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1kuaf9q/how_does_searching_for_a_job_usually_work/

I’m trying to decide on a project to get started on and originally was thinking of making a reverse weather app (would show you similar cities to your own that have the same temperature, with some other features). Since there aren’t any APIs that do exactly this, it would require making a database to store the info of pre-selected cities from a normal weather API and sorting through them. This would also be on desktop.

Then I got into thinking that the reverse weather idea could be an API itself. However, I don’t have any projects under my belt, and I graduate this Fall. I’m also taking summer classes so my time is spread thin and I’m desperately trying to make the best use of it.

"I wish people wouldn't downplay the effort as developer Preface: I am still a junior dev in terms of YoE and would consider myself an average-level dev, in that I can read code, debug, navigate through the codebase, figure out what questions to ask. 

But I wouldn't be able to implement something from scratch with ambiguous to no information or even rewrite or refactor a module.

OK. So, i've been browsing this sub for maybe 3 years? and I would sometimes read opinons here or other subs just how easy their software dev job is and that the challenging part is just passing the interview..

And I feel like that is a lie.. obviously jobs differ from company to company, project to project etc.. 

In my case I was lucky enough to deal with good people, managers, business analysts, stuff people would complain about but if there is something I would complain is the work itself.

There were moments where I would ask myself wtf am I doing working as a developer because some tasks just made me feel like I was staring at a wall, I had no idea how to approach this issue, I would have an idea but going deeper I would eventually get lost and forget why I went down the path the first place.

Right now i'm on a new project which is basically rewrite from scratch of an older project that was done in a couple of years and they want some core functionality implemented in a matter of months..

You might think, oh that doesn't sound so bad.. the logic is already there. Well imagine that programming paradigm changed so from functional to OOP and that you need to integrate 3rd party vendors as well.

"First of all, if the job is easy, you're not learning.  If you're not learning, then your value isn't growing.  Anyone who sits an an easy job and brags about it is deliberately harming their future, especially in this field.

Second, yes, it SHOULD be hard. What makes a job in this field hard is not the code writing, anyone who tells you that is foolishly narrowing their value add.  What makes this job hard is solving the actual problem, and career wise you WANT to be given hard problems, that is, if you want to grow and become more valuable.

When I say hard, I don't mean impossible and i don't mean poorly treated.  Let other people go after the easy/lazy roles. Those just get eliminated over time. You want to be known has a hard problem solver, if not at this job then the next one.  You want to build a career where you can talk about the problems you solved and the ways in which you had to work with others to solve the right problem.

Eventually you will learn to estimate right, push back on bs deadlines, by building a reputation of getting it done well.

"At a certain point the programming clicks in your head and your mental model is built up in such a way that it truly is 'easy'. This is typically when you start learning / discovering that the hard part of software is actually the people. Organization, estimating, decision making, long-term direction with short-term milestones that deliver value now and evolve to the full solution.

I don't think it's wrong of me to say the programming in my job is easy, since it's how it feels to me. I'm sure many people would see what I code all day and claim it's hard and that's fine too. 

Disclaimer: Talking about the jobs I've had, I'm sure there are jobs where the programming is new / novel enough for that to be the main difficulty in the day-to-day work, but for me the times I've had to write truly hard code is rare, and almost always as a result of a poor architecture / up front decision. Most of the time the code does feel trivial to me.

I've been programming so long that I can't even help new programmers all that much. I can mentor an eager junior or mid level, but my friend who wants to pick up programming and career switch I'm just so far removed from how I had to learn when I was 12 that I can't really empathize and my explanations would probably do more harm than good because I operate at a much higher level by default.",comment_3,r/cscareerquestions,Professional,,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1kts6zr/i_wish_people_wouldnt_downplay_the_effort_as/

"When to look for a new job? Title pretty much. At work, and I’ve done something to make two seniors on our team hate me. Every issue they have with me is blasted on public chat or meetings, nothing is brought to me directly, and they have a habit of blocking my PRs from merging without their direct approval. 

I’m one of our top contributors every sprint, I handle issues through every area of the product and work pretty well with other teams within our company, work well with every engineer in our team except these seniors, and have a below average rate of introducing regressions. Because of this, our manager actually likes me quite a bit… but not enough to really stop what’s going on. 

After one public rant about me from one of the seniors the manager pulled us into a huddle and tried to get both of us to make peace. I apologized again for improperly phrasing something and the senior spent the next 20 minutes denying he said anything too aggressive in response. 

To make matters a bit more complicated, one of the seniors is making efforts to chill the heck out but after a year of this I’m having a hard time letting go—and my manager thinks this is a problem. 

Do I start looking for jobs? Part of me says hell yes, but my job has better pay, benefits, and raises than is standard for my area by quite a bit. Market isn’t super great though and I wanted to get promoted to senior before attempting to look for more jobs.

"So, first off, this story sounds a bit one-sided. ""I'm a top contributor"" sounds a bit egotistical. I've never been at a company or on a project where I could really even determine who a top contributor was, nor would I care to know if I had the ability. That said, it's not unreasonable to work with two seniors who suck, so I'll take your story at face value. Just saying, be introspective, it's maybe not all on them.

Anyway, if you are paid well, have a good WLB, get along with everybody else, and feel yourself growing as an engineer...I don't really see much of an issue. The PR thing sounds obnoxious. If you find yourself super frustrated with the role, communicate it to your manager and it's their job to find a solution, especially if it gets in the way of productivity. Either that or yeah you should start looking for work.

That said, best advice I ever got is that it's always the right time to look for work. If you find something great, then you take the job. If you only get offers for companies that seem like downgrades, then you stay where you are. Applying for jobs doesn't have to be a big endeavor. You can just look/apply slowly and wait for the right thing to come along.

If you think you'll get senior soon, though, I might call that a good reason to stick around. Titles are stupid, but it's harder to get a senior role without a past senior role.

"Question for people in their 20s who were recently hired: where did you find the job listing? I just can’t take the LinkedIn data farm anymore, so I’m consulting the oracles here on Reddit. Here’s my situation:

I’m 25 years old living in the pacific northwest. I graduated in 2022 with a BS in Mathematics & Computer Science. Currently, I have five years of experience working as an IT consultant. Two of those years were on campus in university, and three of them have been for an MSP after graduation. I’ve also had a hand in a number of DevOps projects at my current employer, so I do have some professional experience with programming and managing CS-related projects.

I want to move onto greener pastures. My current job has no path for promotion and I’m so tired of IT help desk… but I’m pretty sure every job listing on LinkedIn is fake. I’m just not sure where I should be looking instead.

So, if you’ve recently been in a situation similar to mine and you’ve managed to land a position: where did you find it? Do you work onsite or remote? How long did the process take you?

"Do I know enough for an entry-level non-coding IT role? **Hi,** I’ll be graduating this year with a Master’s degree in Computer Science in Poland, and I’ve been looking for a job for three months without any luck.

I'm not sure what field I want to specialise in, but I know I want to solve problems with systems/devices. I've been thinking about:

* System Administration (Linux/Windows), 
* Networking (I finished CCNA a couple years ago),
* Helpdesk/IT Support role (I have broad, a little bit shallow knowledge across all IT). 

I’m comfortable with Linux, Windows Server, networking, virtualization, and hardware - it feels like decent entry-level know-how, yet I’ve only landed one interview out of \~50 applications, and that role ended up being a stretch.

I know the global market is hard, but I'm stressed. I feel like I wasn't autistic enough to hyperfocus on one area and have 5 years of solid experience at the end of my degree.

A quick googling says A2 french proficiency is a requirement for work visas, so if you're fluent, then I suppose it helps in the sense that it doesn't flat out disqualify you.

"Just refused a job Location: ON, Canada job is Canada remote. 

Just had an interview with HR about a senior devops python engineer position. This is interview 3 after a video interview, technical test and HR casually drops that it's a being your own device company. Like are you guys for real? You go through the hassle of looking for a senior engineer and you can't get them a dedicated laptop separate from their own personal life not to mention the safety of your IP? I find that shocking and disrespectful. I've been applying for jobs for months and I would rather continue my freelance practice than be subjected to the equivalent of a sweatshop. Needless to say I just dead face told her I'm not going to waste your time after she mentioned this is company policy. Rant over. 

Edit : as some of you noted I didn't get an offer, apologies about the unclear title

Edit 2: i will expand on this in a few hrs cause I've written most of my comments with a 6m old trying to eat my phone 

Edit 3: OK now that I can sit on my PC, let me just explain a few things that have caused some confusion in the comments. I'm mostly a python/ML/AI freelancer who wants to get into a full time position. I've worked with many big names in this industry and generally take every interview that I'm given whether it is a small company or not. This particular company is based in Mississauga, ON and has about 30 employees and is in the information systems for transport/logistics. It has about 2.1 stars on Glassdoor in their recent reviews and honestly, I wasn't expecting too much from the job but was giving them the opportunity to show themselves for who they are. I don't really care too much about buying my own laptop per se. It's about how they approach onboarding new employees. I've worked in companies where I was thrown into legacy systems from the first day and I can see the signs written on the wall from a mile away, which is why I decided that I shouldn't proceed. For those of you who say that I'm spoiled and entitled. Bruh, I literally make less than average salary working as a freelancer, all of this while paying 100% more the taxes for CCP of what full time employees pay while having to do my own accounting. In general I do not prefer working freelance but I would rather have the ability to say no than to work on things that will make my life utterly miserable which is why I refer to this kind of environment as a ""sweatshop"".",post,r/cscareerquestions,Professional,403.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1kt5304/just_refused_a_job/

"AI Engineer vs Mobile Dev - Should I Switch Careers ? (For less pay ) Let me get to the point — I'd really like to hear opinions from Senior devs especially.

 I'm an Argentinean Mid-level Mobile Developer, specializing in native Android, but I’ve also worked quite a bit with React Native.

I got offered a job as an AI Engineer thanks to a friend who works there, but it would be as a Junior. The thing is:

1. They pay less

2. It’s for a US-based startup , and there aren’t many real benefits

3. It’s full-time (not contractor)

4. It’s kind of weird because the technical interview is basically a classic FullStack mini-project, nothing AI-related… it seems like the position is more oriented towards FullStack work and consuming LLMs. My friend told me he’s now learning TensorFlow/PyTorch (which is actually what interests me the most, same as Architecture modeling), but apparently he doesn’t work strictly with that.

----------------------------------------
I’ve been looking for Senior Mobile jobs in my stack for the past 6 months — they obviously pay more and have better benefits (though I haven't been lucky, I always make it to the 3rd interview only).

---My questions are:

1- What future do you see for Mobile? With AI and the current market, I’m seeing fewer open roles (in LATAM more than anything). Do you think it makes sense to pivot to something with more demand? Or should I double down and specialize in Mobile?

2- Do you think it’s worth switching to AI Engineering? What future do you see in working with TensorFlow/PyTorch? Or other AI branches ?

P.S. According to a professor I had in college (who’s head of the AI department at a major multinational Spanish company), he said that regardless of what you choose, the future trend is to become an Architect and be an expert in the big picture.",post,r/cscareerquestions,Professional,6.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1ktt4ng/ai_engineer_vs_mobile_dev_should_i_switch_careers/

"Just Received a Fully Remote Job Offer as a Self Taught SWE - Spreading Some Positivity and Hope For anyone looking at my Reddit post history, it would be easy to notice that I have been struggling to land a new job in this tough market.

As a completely self-taught backend engineer, without a university degree nor boot camp, rather just a love for technologies and programming from a young age, and a few years of experience in a very small non-profit organization, the market has not been easy on me at all. During my job hunting journey, I have applied for more than 800 jobs, conducted more than 70 interviews, and was a finalist in the hiring process about 10 times. Yet regardless of that, there was always a candidate more favorable than me which got chosen, until this exact day.

Today I have received an email which was quite unexpected. I have been offered a full-time remote position as a junior software engineer in an international mid-sized company, with big customer base and highly distributed systems. The offer I received is realistic and slightly above average for my years of experience and the consideration it's a fully remote position, therefore I have gladly signed it and accepted it.

The agenda of my post is first and foremost spreading some positivity and hope in this Subreddit in these tough market conditions, because I feel like many people can use it here as a motivation to keep trying. Secondly, I would like to celebrate this moment here in this Subreddit and post about the good times, the same as I did when I posted about the bad times.

"Help choosing my first tech job – backend, SRE, or data? I'm finishing my Bachelor's degree and currently have a few job offers and some ongoing interview processes. I'd love to hear your thoughts on which path would be best to start my career. Ideally, I’d like to stay flexible and be able to explore different areas in the future if my curiosity changes, so I don't want an area that will specialize me too much too early. I have always heard BE engineering seems to be the best role for this kind of felxibility, but please let me know what you think!

Here's the list of opportunities, ordered from most attractive to least (in my opinion):

### Backend Engineer Internship at a Product Company
- **Duration:** 9-month internship, with a possibility of a full-time offer afterwards.
- **Tech stack:** Spring, Kafka, SQL and NoSQL databases.
- **Pros:** I love everything about this—tech stack, company culture, team vibe.
- **Cons:** The pay is lower than the other (non-internship) offers for the first 9 months.

---

### Site Reliability Engineer (SRE) at a Product Company
- **Status:** Interview scheduled next week.
- **Details:** The company was acquired by a major player, so it seems relatively stable.
- **Pros:** I find SRE work interesting.
- **Concerns:** I'm worried that starting my career in SRE might limit my ability to change into other areas later on.

---

### Backend Engineer at an Outsourcing Consultancy
- **Status:** Passed HR round; they're waiting on salary expectations.
- **Details:** They want to move me forward to client interviews.
- **Pros:** I expect to learn a lot, and they were open to salary negotiations—even with my slightly above-entry-level ask.
- **Cons:** Still unclear which client or project I'd end up on.

---

### Data Scientist at a Consulting Company
- **Status:** Just received the message; haven't responded yet.
- **Details:** Seems to involve in-house consulting, with a focus on machine learning.
- **Pros:** They seem very enthusiastic about some ML stuff in my CV and my Python experience (pretty advanced for an entry level).
- **Cons:** I’m not particularly interested in data roles right now. I'd only consider it for a very high salary (mid-level developer range), which might be unrealistic for an entry-level hire.

---

### Internship at a Startup
- **Status:** Offer available.
- **Details:** The startup recently closed a big contract and is expanding.
- **Pros:** I'd probably learn a lot quickly.
- **Cons:** Very low pay. Feels unstable. Work would include a mix of backend, data, and no-code frontend (only one other dev on the team). Might make transitioning to more traditional jobs harder later on.

"Backend engineer, easily. You love the stack so you'll absorb the knowledge, the value you gain during the time will more than make up for a lower pay during, and if you love the team you may end up with a job offer at a better rate anyways.  
None of your other options sound appealing when compared, to me. Do you have it narrowed down?",comment_1,r/cscareerquestions,Professional,,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1ktrop2/help_choosing_my_first_tech_job_backend_sre_or/
"Data science is hard to break into without a masters or PhD and several years of experience in a data science role, so an offer for a data science role early in your career offers to jump start that process and makes future options easier and salary negotiations easier. If you’re at all interested in Data Science I would strongly consider that offer. If not then I would generally just focus elsewhere - Data Science doesn’t really work as a fallback plan or a 2nd option without a lot of school or a lot of experience. 

I wouldn’t consider internships unless they build significant skills or significant inroads at a company you want connections with. You’re trying to establish your career at this point so an internship is just a lower paid lower commitment job - it needs to offer enough to balance that out. 

That leaves the 2 backend offers and the SRE job in consideration if you discard the Data Science role. SRE is a bit more specialized - you won’t build those skills incidentally, it needs to be intentional. It pays well and is in demand, so if you enjoy it it’s not a bad place to focus your efforts. Backend Engineering roles are good general roles and hard to fault, but they don’t build a specific specialty either. Nothing wrong with just building general experience to start though. 

Id consider the SRE or DS roles if those fields specifically interest you. If a specific niche or field doesn’t feel right then just take a backend role and take the XP for a pivot later. I wouldn’t take the internship unless there’s a serious upside on the other side of it. Don’t take the opportunity for SRE or DS experience for granted though - it’s easier to get it early in your career. Later on you might have to contemplate a salary cut if you’re weighing mid / senior level vs having to step backwards to DS I. It’s hard to apply for DS II / Sr roles without experience in those roles, especially on a Bachelors, so the opportunity to get that experience is valuable if you have it (same for SRE).",comment_2,r/cscareerquestions,Professional,,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1ktrop2/help_choosing_my_first_tech_job_backend_sre_or/

"After 4 years at Google, here's my honest take on why their work culture and processes didn't work for me. I recently left Google after nearly four years. I wish I could say it lives up to all the hype, but it didn't. I honestly felt like I did some of the worst work of my career there. The environment, the processes, and team dynamics simply didn't align with my approach for how to collaborate and ship software. I've been reflecting on exactly why I wasn't able to make it work for me.

Just to brace you, I know just how ranty this is going to sound. I'm not writing this as a condemnation of Google, because I know there are people that thrive and enjoy working there. This is just my own personal perspective on it. Take it with a grain of salt.

# Agile is a Sin

I come from companies that do agile processes. It's not perfect, but it's empowering and very adaptive to change. I've been told that agile processes do not scale. So when I joined Google, I was extremely interested in learning how and what Google does to ship software. They must be doing something slightly different or better to ship software at scale, right?

Wrong. They quite literally don't have processes around collaboration. It's basically waterfall. Product writes up a doc. Gets buy-in from leadership. Tosses it at engineering. And then we never see them again, so we're left to implement it as we see fit.

It is literally the most expensive and high risk software development I've seen in my entire career. They basically have blind faith they've hired super smart people that will just magically build the perfect product. Which to be fair, they do quite literally have a lot of *rock star* developers. But relying on purely heroics to ship software is a recipe for burn out and knowledge silos.

Also, they don't ship software. Deadlines are arbitrary. There are so many times when we approach a deadline only for ""X"" feature needs to absolutely be there on release so we'll just push out the release. I think deadlines are stupid, so I don't want to pretend like I care about them. But I do care about shipping software. The sooner you ship, the sooner you can start to learn and prove that your core assumptions are right or wrong. So to ship sooner, you need to downscope. If your MVP (minimal viable product) requires several really difficult features to implement, maybe it's not an MVP anymore. But then again, I guess no one called it an MVP, but me, who is used to shipping software regularly.

# The Doc Machine

So, if you're not regularly shipping software, how can you possibly measure impact?

Docs.

Endless docs.

Countless docs.

So many docs that it can be impossible to find what doc says what you did.

Google's mission is to ""organize the world's information."" Internally in Google, they generate a lot of information in docs, and it's very hard to search and find the information you're looking for.

What's the point of docs no one reads? Well, since software doesn't get shipped, I assume it just acts as a laundry list of links when attempting to show impact for your performance reviews or promotions. You might not have shipped anything, but at least you left a paper trail of what you didn't ship.

You want to know the worst part of it? They want you to write a doc on a system you don't understand. So you write it up, make some assumptions and send it out for approval. No one reads it to approve it. Let's say you get your single approver and start implementing. Guess what, your core assumption is wrong. The data isn't in the right place, or the data you thought had what you needed, doesn't. Now you need to rewrite the doc.

What's the point of getting approval? What's the point of a doc that is wrong from the start? What's the point of upfront design that is wrong? Why not just implement and find out what actually is going on and make it work?

The point is, it's just theater to make it look like we're doing our jobs. Why isn't the software the evidence we're doing our job?

I'm not trying to say docs are bad, and everything should just be tribal knowledge. But I am saying docs that need to be rewritten from the get-go are a waste of time.

# Bad docs

Ironically, despite needing to write so many docs to implement things. When you read other people's docs, you might notice something. They're very high-level. They're more like a thesis, then like actual documentation on how to use an API.

What is the point of docs that don't answer how to use an API?

Focusing on the high-level philosophy of a service is honestly distracting and unhelpful. I think I understand why this happens. It's hard to keep docs up to date. So if you keep them high-level, they won't become obsolete or need to be updated. But I don't care about your thesis defense; I just want to use your software to solve my problem.

And I know Google can write good docs. [Angular](https://angular.dev/overview) has fantastic documentation. [Proto Buffers](https://protobuf.dev/overview/) have great docs. Both of these are made by Google. I guess the difference is they're public facing and Google doesn't prioritize internal docs like they do their external facing ones.

# A Culture of Silence

So, there is a lot of lip service towards how open Google is. Say how they're trying to encourage employees in fireside chats to not ask anonymous questions so that leadership can follow up with the individual to gain more context. (This, by the way, does not prevent people from asking anonymously, which they do.)

There is also a culture of no-blame retrospectives. They don't run regularly, even when I advocate for them. And worst of all, when we finally do run retrospectives, we don't discuss challenges and problems we are encountering. So, what's the point of a retrospective that doesn't talk about pain points and mitigation strategies? From my perspective, it just looks like theater and a way to paint a false view that everything is good and we have nothing to complain about. Or worse, that we are helpless and we really cannot change anything.

Coming from companies with genuinely open cultures where we fostered candid and open discussions, it's baffling to me that no one seems willing to put in the minimal effort to improve everyone's lives.

It is better to be positive about a broken system and keep the status quo than it is to ask people to put in a laughable small level of effort to make everyone's life better. Not everything is going smoothly all the time. And assuming we **want** it to run smoothly, we should probably discuss the pain points and workarounds or solutions to them. Knowledge silos are bad. More open discussions can reduce knowledge silos which reduces the burden on individuals and gives everyone a balance for job responsibilities.

# A Culture of Bottom-Up (but only if it's top-down)

So, in meetings with leadership. They emphasize that our *bottom-up culture* is how we do such great work. And by *bottom-up*, they apparently mean *top-down*.

# When Bottom-Up Meets Brick Wall

So, let's say our UXR (user experience research team) has come up with an obvious gap in our offerings. What would you do? Perhaps gather some people from multiple disciplines and brainstorm a solution. Or maybe you just get leadership and design in a room and iterate on who knows what behind closed doors for literal months, before you ever even involve engineering. And for those few months, you pull engineering off their current teams in a large-scale reorg and don't give them marching orders instead just give them a bunch of vague ideas of what they might want to build. Like...what is engineering supposed to do? Build against an invisible moving target? The answer is, that is exactly what we do. Not because it's a good use of our time, but because we have nothing better to do and we have no input into the vision of the product.

So let's say, you're an engineer, like yours truly, and you think that process is stupid, and instead you really do want to try to implement a bottoms up initiative. So maybe, see a feature, we originally spec'd out but was dropped because they didn't see the current value in implementing it. But it sounds kind of cool, and shouldn't be that difficult to get an MVP for this feature. Maybe you go to reach out across teams, pull in people that own data you need, a team that works on Android and iOS, and try to get people from the backend team so you can make an e2e MVP to demonstrate this feature is doable. Also, act as a test bed to show smaller agile processes work and probably how we should handle work in the org.

Sounds pretty encouraging, right? But here is the real problem, one of the teams is a no-show. Not only are they a no-show, they also refuse to work with you and ignore your messages. You escalate to your manager and tech lead, and that team also ignores them too. You work with the other teams and implement everything, but say the one thing to tie everything together and make it work e2e. Let's say a backend team refused to work with you. So, naturally, offer to do the work for them. And they tell you to not do that. Because it's not my code base, I'm not on call, and I don't have to maintain it. So what do you do?

What I did was create a video demo that made it look like it should work and presented it to leadership. We were reorged before this demo was even presented, so the feature died on the vine.

# The Only MVP Is Minimum Viable Plausible Deniability

Let's say that you do still believe in the rhetoric that, *the organization really does believe in bottom-up*. So you take some time and write up a doc (which is an activity you don't enjoy but if that's how the game is played, and you want to play ball, you do it). The doc outlines an open source initiative that is coincidentally attempting to solve the space we just tried to fill. But since there's an open-source community trying to solve the same problem space, maybe we can just leverage that and even help them grow at the same time. Anyway, it was super nice to have leadership hear me out, but they didn't want to go with it, because it turns out that one of the reasons we hamstrung our last project was because we were attempting to skirt a legal definition that the open source project is tackling head on. Suddenly, it made more sense: The original project was destined to fail, not because it was a bad idea, but because they were trying to handicap the implementation to avoid legal scrutiny.

Fundamentally, we're not trying to build good software or solve problems. We're just trying to do something without bringing legal scrutiny to Google.

I understand getting sued sucks, and the law is often weaponized against Google. But why handicap ourselves? There are so many other ideas out there. Why not pursue things that are higher value and lower risk? I cynically believe it could just be virtue signaling to investors, to show Google is trying new things and still taking risks. But their risks seem high-risk, low-reward, compared to the normal practices I'm used to, which focus on mitigating risk and prioritizing high value. Taking risks here seems to be about signaling growth, but are they truly growing? Wouldn't the more obvious path be to take the calculated legal risk to solve a real problem and potentially achieve genuine growth? I don't know; I'm not in leadership. I just had a worm's-eye view of the machine.

# Grassroots Agility, Stomped by Apathy

Let's say you came from an agile background and you even believe it. Because you've seen it solve very obvious communication issues that you see arise in large organizations. You've experienced it firsthand, you know it works. You go and explain it to your manager, they say that there are organization issues and leadership is resistant to change. They don't discourage you from trying, but they kind of set the expectations that nothing will change. But, what else are you supposed to do? Nothing?

So you have a meeting with your skip manager (your manager's manager) once again advocating to adopt agile processes and maybe get more stakeholder buy-in. And they give you the advice to do it locally with your team. You know, ""bottom-up"" kind of stuff.

You present it to the team. They hate it. They don't want processes. They don't want collaboration or more communication. They say agile practices are dehumanizing and that we are not interchangeable cogs in the machine. A bit of a disservice towards agile processes. But they are willing to try some of the ceremonies.

But literally, for any reason whatsoever, they cancel meetings, like retrospectives or stand-ups. Maybe we need more time to finish a feature, or maybe it's a holiday, or we get reorged. And we never start up the meeting again, at least until I ask for it. Followed by it once again being canceled at the drop of a hat. And no one cares. They don't see the value in it. And to be honest, the ceremonies are toothless because we don't discuss actual problems, we don't discuss work progress to reduce knowledge silos, and action items are never done and are also usually not meaningful anyway.

The reason people don't see the value of agile processes is not that it's not a good framework to address communication gaps, but because just doing the ceremonies without the communication makes them pointless. There is value in the ceremonies if they're being used to address the problems. But actively ignoring the problems, even with ceremonies, means we're now just wasting people's time.

# Bottom-Up, Top-Down, and Going Nowhere

If there is a bottom-up culture at Google, it is self sabotaging. There is so much momentum for the status quo that actual process change is near impossible. The only change that appears to work is a top-down mandate, which they try every year with constant reorgs and get the same results.

# There is No Team in I

So, coming from an agile background (I know I sound like I'm in a cult, with how much I bring it up, but bear with me), I've come to the understanding that I as an individual do not necessarily matter. It's about putting aside ego and working together on a larger goal. This also comes with a nice benefit of distributing responsibility, and reducing burn out.

That's pretty damn *ungoogley*. At Google, they're rugged cowboys. They pull themselves up by the bootstrap and don't care about your collaboration. You need to own everything. Your work, your feature, your project, your process, your career. No one is here to help you. You need to just do it yourself. Which is ironic, as [googley-ness](https://staffeng.medium.com/being-googly-62b75dd642df) should theoretically not embody it. But the performance evaluation surely doesn't emphasize trying to make teamwork work.

[A bus factor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus_factor) of 1 is seen as a positive thing. It means you've made yourself invaluable. You are the sole point of contact, and despite that sounding like a lot of annoying responsibility, it's perceived as good because you *own* it.

I hate knowledge silos. I do not believe it makes anyone more valuable. I fought against the hoarding of knowledge. I'd include people into meetings to make sure I'm not the only one with context. I'd ask stupid questions and repeat talking points in meetings to make sure I understood and we were aligned. These are all considered negative things at Google. Because it is seen as wasting everyone's time in the meeting. It is better to repeat yourself with several dozen 1:1s (or I guess write yet another doc no one will read) than it is to talk it over in a group and make sure there is no ambiguity.

It could just be me though. But it sure felt like it, when my manager said I was *""leaning on others too much.""* How else am I supposed to read that?

I've never seen such an environment that is literally so hostile to collaboration.

# Performative Theater

I hate 1:1s. I think they're a waste of time. I would even argue that most 1:1s are a waste of time in every context. I'm probably being hyperbolic, as I'm sure there must be cases where 1:1s are beneficial. But I'm struggling to think of one right now.

1:1s are a bottleneck to communication. And judging by how often my 1:1s were canceled with my managers, I'd have to say they don't value them either.

So, I'm a huge advocate for openness and transparency. And after one reorg (I went through 5 reorgs in my 4 years at Google, and been through 7 managers, chaos is the norm) leadership was attempting to be more open and transparent and so allowed anyone to join their meetings. So, since I felt like I did not have enough context to understand their decisions, I joined those meetings.

When they asked if everyone had context on a doc, I was the only person to raise my hand and said I did not. I guess this was a sin to acknowledge my own ignorance, because it turns out after the next meetings I was removed from the subsequent meetings. I asked my manager if I could be brought back to gain more context, and he told me I had enough context to do my job. While probably true, I had a suspicion that my work was not very high priority. Maybe we should work on something else. Anyway, this taught me that it's all optics. I think my manager wanted to control the narrative. If he wasn't there to be a middle man, what is his job? Like, seriously, what *is* his job? I still don't understand what value he brought.

# Tech Debt Forever

To say Google's code base is complex is an understatement. Not only is it complicated, it's also a mess. Not only is it a mess, but it's also poorly documented. And not only that, but it actively fights you as you make changes and try to understand it.

Cryptic compile errors. Cryptic build errors. Cryptic run time errors. And just when you think you've finally got it working. There are blockers on merging the code because of invisible linting errors you didn't know you were violating. Or there is some weird test case that broke, but only after 3 hours of running tests in the CI pipeline. Or maybe, you just want to delete some code, but it turns out that the code you're trying to delete has a different release schedule, so it cannot be deleted with other code. And the other code is dependent on the first bit of code that you cannot delete being deleted. The code is constantly fighting you. And maybe if we could discuss these issues in a group, we could understand the problems quicker or come up with strategies to mitigate them...but it turns out talking about how much it sucks to write code is frowned upon. So you just need to keep it to yourself. And I'm left wondering, *am I the problem?* Is my career a lie? Do I have imposter syndrome if I don't actually know what I'm doing? It makes you question everything.

So I talked with my director (the skip’s manager) about my challenges. And I was candid about it. And he said, ""It sounds like you need mentorship."" And I said, that's exactly what I need. And he said he'd help get me some. I messaged him every week for a few months. He offloaded this responsibility to my manager, who naturally, did nothing. By the time I left, I made the request 8 months prior. I was clearly not getting the mentorship I asked for. My manager's *wonderful* feedback was, ""maybe you should find your own mentorship."" And it does make me wonder, ""what is *your* job if it is not to help me do *my* job better?"" Anyway, I also was unable to find mentorship on my own. And it does make me wonder, does anyone truly understand the beast that is Google's complex internally built tech stack with poor documentation? Even the internal AI that is usually pretty good at explaining some of the code, will just straight-up hallucinate how the code works and then it becomes very hard to understand. The AI will tell you a very convincing lie, but you won't know it's a hallucination or how to possibly fix it, because the documentation is poor and the only way to learn how it really works is to reverse-engineer it by performing code archaeology.

# I'm out

So I left Google. It was amicable. This was, of course, also only my personal experience in my particular organization. I've been told different parts of the org and different teams are said to have different cultures. Heck, even some people might even thrive in the culture I described. But it's not for me.

They gave me severance, which was honestly extremely nice. I tried so hard to bring cultural change to Google, but there is no willingness to change. Honestly, with the amount of money they're printing with ads and search, there is no pressure for them to make any changes.

There is a clear cultural mismatch between what I value and what Google values. Even if Google pays lip service that they value the same things I value, their actions clearly show they do not. And so, I am honestly happy to be free from them and given the time to look for a place that values what I want.

I used to believe I was *a mercenary for hire to the highest bidder*. But you know what? Apparently, within reason. I just want to work, collaborate, and iterate on software. Is that asking for too much? The one thing I can take away from my time at Google is that I now have a clearer understanding of what I'm looking for in my next step.",post,r/cscareerquestions,Professional,2077.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1kslf3b/after_4_years_at_google_heres_my_honest_take_on/

"This just sounds like you had four years experience at a huge multinational.

Big companies always end up having silos and subcultures. There is always resistance to change because to implement change you have to convince a lot of people and also, the thing they're currently doing seems to be working.

It's also the case that at big companies, some parts of the business subsidize other parts. And the big tech firms are all kings of this. Google has a handful of products that make stupid amounts of money, and everything else is just for vanity or politics. If you're in one of those core teams, then there will be pressure to perform and also likely lots of scrutiny. And if you're far away from the money-makers your job is to make the pencil pushers who justify your pay cheque happy.

Big companies I've worked at and have had colleagues work at also seem to prefer a lot more paperwork and documentation so that they can waterfall all the most cost sensitive parts of their business to offshore teams in countries with lower costs of living. This seems to make it more cost effective to build software, but also to protect all the IP.

Some advice I was given is that as an individual at one of these organizations. You can barely see the tip of the iceberg. The culture, history, and trajectory of the part of the business you're in are all potentially decided by people far away. You're literally a cog in the wheel, and whether you fight it or go with it the business is doing exactly what it has planned to do.",comment_3,r/cscareerquestions,Professional,,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1kslf3b/after_4_years_at_google_heres_my_honest_take_on/

"For what it's worth, a lot of Seniors aren't looking for people reaching out to them unsolicited. I ignore every LinkedIn message and email I get from random recruiters.

There has to be something really crazy in the initial contact that happens to catch my eye before I blindly delete it for me to even read your message. Like if you put ""$500k TC opportunity perfect for you"" in the title... whether I want to seriously consider it or not, I'd be amused enough to open it.

The Senior's that aren't desperate for work, and aren't struggling with job searching, generally don't need or want unsolicited recruitment. When I want to change jobs, I pick companies I'm interested in and intentionally apply to them. I'm *choosing* the companies I want to apply to.

Buying ads *might* get me to notice you as well.

But I don't generally view unsolicited contact in a positive light. Maybe that's just a me thing. But that's how I treat my job searches.

"I’m struggling to learn & grow in my first dev job - how can I improve and get hired elsewhere? Hi everyone, I’m a graduate software engineer working in a Big 4 consulting firm. I’m about 9 months into my first role, and while things have improved a bit, I’m still really struggling and could use some career advice.

So heres a bit about my background. I started in tech through a conversion Master’s and landed a graduate role in a Big 4 consultancy. The first few months were rough. I was getting minimal work, no mentorship, and I felt totally lost. I nearly quit, but after speaking to management, I was paired with a senior dev and shifted to frontend (React), which I’m more comfortable with.



My problem is that I’m still not learning like I want to. I lean too heavily on ChatGPT and feel like I don’t really understand what I’m doing. I feel stuck and like I’m not becoming a better software engineer. I’m constantly being rejected from even other graduate level dev jobs, and I don’t know what I’m doing wrong. I have completed a couple of interviews, one company was kind of a dream role which I do think I was pretty unqualified for but I did get to the final stage of the process. I actually pulled out of another interview process because I realised during the first interview that this wasn’t the right job for me.



So here’s what I’m doing to try to learn and get better. I have an active github with personal projects, and a publicly available CV website. I attempt most leetcode daily challenges, and complete online udemy courses. I also attend local tech meetups and listen to tech podcasts to expand my knowledge.



So these are my questions:

* *How do I get better as a software engineer when I feel like I’m just guessing or relying on AI?*
* *What do other junior devs do to actually learn rather than just getting by?*
* *Why do I keep getting rejected from other jobs/how can I make myself stand out?*

Any advice, resources or honest stories from other devs would really help. Thanks!",post,r/cscareerquestions,Professional,8.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1ktiue4/im_struggling_to_learn_grow_in_my_first_dev_job/
"Maybe stop using AI? Until a couple of years ago it wasn't an option and juniors did fine. It can be a useful tool, but if learning is your goal, it's probably a hindrance as you're seeing.

If you do use it, maybe limit to asking for advice on how to solve the things for yourself or what steps you can take to understand the issue, rather than help on solving the issue directly.

"I can empathise with you on some level. I'm also a SWE that works at big4 and constantly feel like i'm lost or not knowledgable enough. Early on, I also felt that I didn't get much mentorship and was just thrown into the deep end, asked to implement feature X, enhancement Y, or bugfix Z, in a huge codebase, with little guidance. Though, now I feel quite fortunate because I ended up learning a lot from those early experiences, a lot more than I think most devs early in their careers would.

I also have felt the same way with AI, especially when it's crunch time and I need to really accelerate my output. Something that has helped me is treating it more like a search engine to find information I need, but I write the almost all the code myself. I really try to understand what it's telling me and will cross reference with other resources as well. This makes it so I really understand and know that I can backup the code I have written if i'm questioned during a PR. I also maintain a large personal document of just general CS concepts and fundementals; whenever I learn something new from AI (and confirmed it's correct), i'll add it to this document. So I kind of force myself to constantly learn and understand what i'm doing, while still reaping the benefit of AI.

If you have been doing alright so far and it sounds like you spend a lot of time trying to improve outside of work, I feel like your feeling of being totally lost may largely be imposter syndrome. Sure AI can generate a lot of code, but you would still be reading and understanding it to ensure it is applicable for your situation and actually works. So I think you probably know more than you think. I also believe that completely cutting AI out would not be beneficial in the long term, because using it is a skill in itself, and is likely to just continue to get more important.

  
Otherwise, it sounds like you're doing all the right things. Keep working on personal projects, use and learn technologies that interest you and that are in demand, and continue to challenge yourself with Leetcodes. You're still a grad (i'm assuming), you're not going to know everything straightaway and there will always be plenty more for you to learn. If you are serious about wanting to become a better engineer and focus on that, in time you will.",comment_2,r/cscareerquestions,Professional,,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1ktiue4/im_struggling_to_learn_grow_in_my_first_dev_job/
"I've got about 10 years of experience and use AI most working days. 

I always go to docs first if there is something I don't understand or if I'm struggling to debug something. That should be your foundation for anything that doesn't make sense to you.

If I'm really stuck, I'll ask ChatGPT for help and sometimes I'll get a helpful answer, but hallucination is still a huge problem. For example, I asked it yesterday how to do something in spring and it just completely made up some application properties that didn't exist.

The reality is that if you're just an AI monkey you probably don't have great long term career prospects, because anybody can type prompts into ChatGPT. 

I personally think AI is most helpful in translating your thoughts into code and automating repetitive tasks (IE fix these static code compiler errors in a big code base), so I'd focus on using it in that manner instead of removing the need for you to problem solve.",comment_3,r/cscareerquestions,Professional,,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1ktiue4/im_struggling_to_learn_grow_in_my_first_dev_job/

"OP, listen to this advice. Don’t ask chat gpt how to write something for you. Try reading the documentation or looking at other code in the repo that does something similar and figure out why and how it works. After you write it, then ask chat gpt what it thinks or how it works but keep in mind it’s a probabilistic model so it could be wrong. Always double check with the documentation or look up articles by vetted sources that have written about the same piece of technology. It’ll give you way more insight.

Technology is a huge field and there are so many layers as well as tools. I remember being a fresh new grad and even though I learned about the different components in computer systems and how memory is evicted out of ram and how different networking protocols  handled communication. Getting my first internship all of that was so abstracted from me by the tools we were using that I felt like I had no idea why things were written the way they were or why we used certain tools.

Take time to ask questions and learn the answers to those questions. Take notes and study them. Slowly it all starts coming together and years later you know exactly how the service or app you’re working on is leveraging the framework and language you’re using and working together with the os on the server or computer it runs on to do the things that it is doing. 

I will say this. I was overwhelmed at the beginning. I think most people are. I really enjoyed being able to build something by just writing some code. But it was extremely frustrating at times and sometimes I wondered if I was in the wrong profession. It took me finding out it was really rewarding knowing so much of how things worked to find passion in my career and stick with it.",comment_5,r/cscareerquestions,Professional,,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1ktiue4/im_struggling_to_learn_grow_in_my_first_dev_job/

"You just hit the level where you aren’t among the smartest in the room anymore. Be logical about it - if you keep advancing, getting into more and more selective organizations, you’ll eventually hit your limit. Honestly I think growing up being the one of the higher performing kids in grade school can make you feel like you actually ARE one of the smartest people in the world, and so it’s a big ego hit when you see it’s definitively not true. High grade kids are especially prone to this because, as we all know, grades measure how good you are at testing, not performing a job.


Take advantage of the opportunity to learn humility. You said it yourself: you actually have to try now. Why is that bad? Trust me, you don’t want to be in a position where you’re a top performer just by coasting. If you have any degree of self-improvement motivation, like you clearly do, you’ll be tearing your hair out knowing that you could be doing more.

"[NY] Is it ok to assign diverse employees extra DEI-related duties because they are not a white male? I work for a large company with a heavy focus on DEI despite about 80% of employees being straight white men. I'm considered a ""diverse employee"" in a couple of ways, but I'm in a technical role as an individual contributor so DEI attributes aren't really relevant to my position other than all of my coworkers are white men. 

My company has an ongoing initiative to try to boost diverse candidate numbers, and part of that is using more ""visibly diverse"" employees-  women, people of color, visibly disabled, or gender non conforming- in recruiting events like interviews or job fairs. As part of the policy, I get scheduled to sit in on just about every interview my department conducts since there's really no other ""visibly diverse"" employees available.  

I'm not in HR, I don't have any direct reports, and I don't hire people, so all of this is in addition to my regular job which I'm now struggling to manage amidst all of these DEI requirements. And just recently I was called in from a vacation day to sit in on an interview panel. I asked HR (via email) to confirm that they still have this requirement and voiced my concern that this is causing me to struggle with my technical workload. They confirmed that it was still a requirement and that I should talk to my manager if I'm struggling to manage my workload, but it's really irritating me that I'm only being asked to do it BECAUSE I'm not a white man.

"You don't have the legal right to take unpaid time off unless it's CFRA, FMLA, or PDL. I think that's what you're missing.


So let's say you have 4 hours sick time left, and you need a whole day off. You're at 6.5pts with your job, and will be fired at 7pts. Calling in is 1pt. You take 4 hours sick and 4 hours unpaid/unapproved time off. You get .5pts, hit 7, and get legally fired. 

Question 28, bottom 2 paragraphs answer this question:

https://www.dir.ca.gov/dlse/paid_sick_leave.htm

""an employee has an unscheduled absence that would otherwise result in an “occurrence” under an employer’s attendance policy, and if the employee chooses to use accrued paid sick leave for only part of the unscheduled absence (for example, if the employee is absent for a full eight-hour day of work, but elects to use only four hours of his or her accrued paid sick leave for the absence [which the employee is allowed to do], the employer would be allowed to give an “occurrence” (or 1/2 of an “occurrence”) for the one-half day of unscheduled absence for which no paid sick leave was use"" 

""Only time that is properly taken as accrued paid sick leave is protected from disciplinary action.  The same would be true if the employee had a full eight-hour unscheduled absence, but only had available four hours of accrued paid sick leave.  The portion of the unscheduled absence not covered by accrued paid sick leave could be subject to disciplinary action under the employer’s attendance policy.""

They can say ""get to work"" and you can say ""no"" and they can fire you.

"[UA] I’m having a hard time fitting in with the team at my first job I’m 18 and recently started working as a waitress — it’s my first job ever. I work at a small restaurant. Most of the staff there are younger girls, around 15–17, still in school. There’s one girl who’s 16, and for some reason, she disliked me from the start. She’s constantly criticizing me, yelling at me, telling me I’m doing everything wrong.

Today, I heard her say to a new guy, “Everything going okay? Let me know if you need anything.” I’ve never heard her speak to me like that. And later today she was yelling at me for sitting down for a quick rest — saying there’s too much to do — but a minute later I saw her sitting in the back with that same new guy, on her phone, vaping.

All of this would be fine if it weren’t for the fact that I have to listen to her. She’s been working there for a year and kind of has “seniority,” so people treat her like she’s in charge. Overall, I don’t really enjoy working with this team. It feels like everyone is best friends with each other, and I’m just the odd one out.

The only people I actually feel comfortable with are the bartender and one other waitress — they’re both around 22. Honestly, I think I’m just really different from most of the people working there. It’s mostly high school girls who swear all the time, go out drinking every night, skip school — that sort of vibe. I’ve never been like that. I graduated with honors, I barely drink, don’t smoke, and I actually enjoy being home.

Lately, I’ve been thinking about quitting. Spending 12-hour shifts with people I have nothing in common with is exhausting.

And we don't have a manager I can turn to. We have a receptionist and a head waitress, but it's not like they care.

If anyone has advice on how to deal with this, I’d really appreciate it",post,r/AskHR,Professional,0.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHR/comments/1kugsye/ua_im_having_a_hard_time_fitting_in_with_the_team/
"Sounds like you are working hard.  But, may i offer you some advice?  NONE of these people are your friends.  Do not treat them like friends, think of them like friends or try to joke or have fun with them like friends.  Learn now at your early age that there are some nasty people in most every work place and you just IGNORE them and just show up and do your job.  ANd, by ignore, i still mean to be cordial and polite, but do NOT give your emotional energy to these people.

So, show up, do your job, work your shift, get paid, go home.  Do NOT take any of their nonsense in.  And TRUST yourself.   You might not know everything but you are smart.  Think about being efficient and being a good server.  Basically just pay attention to your table.  Greet your customers in a nice way.  Make sure their water and drinks are refilled.  Be attentive but don't hover.  Come back and check on them and so forth.  And then go do whatever your other duties are, wiping table, running the vacuum, etc.  Who cares what THEY do?

"You are always going to have co-workers and managers who you don't get along with, don't like, or don't like you.  It's human nature and it's how things work in the business world.  It's harder in a small environment, but you might use this as an opportunity to learn how to work with difficult people.  It's a great skill to have in times when you have to work with these types of people.

As you say, you have to listen to her, so she's effectively your boss.  One way to look at it is to respect the position if you can't respect the person.  Try to filter out her tone and her picking on you and look at what you are doing and why she is picking on you and see if you can not do anything that gives her an excuse to pick on you.

Have you talked to the bartender and the other waitress to see if they think she's being unfair to you?  Maybe they can give you some pointers since they probably have been around her longer and know how she operates.

In my job, I really hate my boss, but I'm stuck with this person for the time being.  I know from talking to their other direct reports that they like x, y and z and value those 3 things highly.  So I make sure I do x, y and z plus a few other things I've learned about them myself.  A promotion, 3 raises and 17 bonuses later, I've got the hang of them.

"[GA] Resume Omissions I’m debating how to approach an important interview regarding my resume. This for a position in a highly rated civil engineering firm.

I had to quit a job I had started in September because I was working 17 hrs a day since I was committed to completing the project. It completely consumed me and almost broke up with my wife because of this. My manager was a complete asshole and was constantly belittling me and never provided me with resources to help with my workload, so I quit in March. I could have stayed but I was not mentally in sound position to endure the job, could also done FMLA but my decision was impulsive because I needed to save my marriage. 

Took time off to really think what I wanted to do and scored an interview with a company I really like.

Here is the problem, I omitted the last job I had in my resume because I didn’t want to explain what happened fearing it will look bad on me. Realized now that work history shows up on third party services and it is likely that the company I want to work for will find out. 

Did some digging and turns out my previous employer and the company I am interviewing with use the same third party verification service.

My interview is in a week so I’m trying to figure out what is the best approach. Either come clean during the interview and provide them with a revised resume that includes my previous employer or just roll the dice and make an excuse if they find out?

This has been a learning experience for me, I had never quit and be in this position. Maybe be better to include my last employer to avoid having this dilemma even if it looks bad in my resume.

"[Pa] Job search with prior conviction [PA]

Hi all — I’m applying for a non-CDL position that may involve driving a company vehicle. I had an ARD for a DUI in April 2023, which has since been expunged. I also had older driving-related offenses back in 2006–2007 (including a DUI conviction in 2007 and an accident involving damage that led to an ARD in 2006), but nothing since.

My criminal record is clean now, and I’ve worked hard to move forward and stay on the right path. However, I know employers and insurance providers sometimes check driving histories, and I’m trying to understand how far back they typically look — especially in Pennsylvania.

Would this expunged DUI still show up in a background check or insurance review? Will older offenses from 2007 matter, even if they don’t show on PATCH or Clean Slate?

I want to be upfront, but I’m also trying to figure out how much of this I need to disclose if the application didn’t ask directly. Any HR folks or hiring managers familiar with Pennsylvania law and company vehicle policies — I’d really appreciate your insight.

"Now is the time to tell them, since they have made an offer and you are in the offer negotiation stage. Even if you wait to tell them until you have accepted the offer, they can absolutely let you go if you tell them once you start working. You have no job protection.

What’s done is done, and so let’s focus on trying to help you keep this role. If you tell them now, and they pull the offer, it looks like discrimination. By telling them now, you can propose either a delayed start date, or ask if they would be willing to give you 6 to 8 weeks of unpaid time off. You will not be eligible for short term disability under any plan that I’m aware of, because your pregnancy pre-dates the start of the policy, which means you excluded. 

Yes, they may find “some other reason“ to pull the offer, but if they do that, there’s no doubt they would fire you as soon as you miss work anyway. So you’re really in the worse of a situation if you tell them now then you would be if you tell them after you start, but at least if you tell them now you have a chance.

"Most of them aren’t going to care. They work off the information you provide and are more concerned that you actually worked in the positions you claimed. 

If you find one that does, it’s usually going to be a more through check that may pull credit which may reveal previous employers (looking at you Experian), and/or an actual background investigator who is interviewing your contacts and people who know you.

A background check is a general term that means something different at each company. 

Local criminal history, federal criminal history, sex offender and terrorism watchlist are pretty common. Usually that’s automated through public records databases unless you have lived in an annoying state that still requires a courthouse visit. 

It may include employment verification where a form is emailed or faxed to an employer or they call your old HR department and verify James/dates/title/eligible for rehire. 

Depending on the job they may verify education through the clearinghouse or requesting a copy of your diploma. They may verify professional licenses that are still active. 

If it’s driving related they may run an MVR which checks for traffic and driving infractions. 

It may include references checks.

I am welcome and encouraged to apply to the new role being created. It will oversee my current duties plus several new tasks from the new dept.  but the role is being stepped down one level below the director level.

I am feeling pretty raw about it and dont think it is fair to level down while taking on more. But also, i have bills to pay.

How do i handle this? I have been talking to my boss for over a year about how can I grow and move up, checked all those boxes, and instead will move down. Which means, if ever, i would have to fight for a promotion back to my current level before moving up higher.

Are you already a director? How does your department compare in size to the department you’d be in the new role for? It’s very possible that you have a director title but it doesn’t align with actually being a director compared to the rest of the org structure.

"Reported to HR for ""singing"" [CA] I was working in an office.  I moved to a different department that was located in another state and was able to work from home for a while.  My company has a rule that is you live within 50 miles of an office, you have to come in 3 days a week, so I was assigned a work station located in a backroom corner office with a door.  There is another work station that belongs to someone who hardly ever comes in.  
Because my manager works in another state, I was slacking on going to the office like I should. I was reported to my manager by someone in the office for fobbing in and leaving (which I admit I did, as the company tracks when you go into the office using your fob) and was required to start going in 3 days a week.  
The person who reported me is now very annoyed by me (I assume they were hoping I would get fired for some reason).  Please note: when I am in the office, I stay in my little office room with the door closed and try not to bother anyone.  I brought my own coffee machine, a little mini fridge for cold items, etc, anything so that I need to leave that room as little as possible.  When the other person in that room is there (we get along splendidly btw), the door is usually left open because people come in and speak to them about stuff and leave without closing the door. 
The person who reported me (whom I had never had issues with in the past) has now reported me to HR for the fob thing, along with a sign I placed on my workstation asking others not to use it, and ""slamming doors, stomping around the office, talking loudly on meeting calls, and singing"".  Yes, singing! 
Now, the door to my office room does close loudly, which I was not aware of at first, so the door got slammed a couple times before I realized I had to close it very carefully, which I started doing even before the complaint. I have a heavy stride, always have, and have always been told I am a stomper lol. I work with people in different states, so I am constantly talking to others on meeting calls.  And yes, I do sing/hum quietly to myself while I work with headphones on.  
This person is a manager for a different department and I was allowing her people, who are fully remote and do not have stations in the office, to use my desk since I was hardly ever there.  When I did go in, I felt rude kicking someone off my computer so that I could use it.  Since I am now being required to go in, I placed the sign on my desk so they would know it could no longer be used by them. 
HR talked to my manager first.  In regards to the fob thing, which they deemed the only real issue, since it was already being addressed, they let it go. The sign thing, once I explained it, made perfect sense to my manager and hr. My manager and team all know I sing to myself as it has happened before on a call when I thought I was muted and they thought it was hilarious and not an issue. My manager laughed and said her daughter also has a heavy stride, like me. 
I told my manager I felt uncomfortable and unwelcome in the office now and she was very understanding and agreed that these were incredibly petty grievances.  After she spoke to hr again, she said it seemed like they understood everything and agreed that this was very petty. They said they would tell the complainer that basically ""we all have to live together"" kinda thing and that those types of complaints need to be brought to my manager, not HR. 
Literally everyone else in the company loves my positive energy and upbeat personality, except this one hater now, apparently.  I received the highest performance rating possible in my most recent review also. The HR person mentioned the hater might be angry because I wasn't doing what I was supposed to be doing as far as coming in and feels some type of way towards me now. 
They did say to continue what I was doing as far as sticking to myself in my little room with the door closed and staying out of the way.  I was a bit concerned my job may be in jeopardy so I have researched and found that actually a lot of people think that reporting to HR can actually make the complainer look bad and raises red flags against them.

"That was a lot.

1. You are supposed to work in an office 3 days a week, at a workstation near a back corner, with a door.
2. There is another work station that belongs to someone who hardly ever comes in.
3. Because your manager works in another state, I were slacking on going to the office like you should. Someone reported to your manager that you were ""fobbing in and leaving"", which you admitted.  This same person (a manager in a different department) reported you again for placing a sign on your workstation to not use it.  They also reporting you for slamming doors, stomping around the office, talking loudly on meeting calls, and singing. 
4. You agree your door closes loudly but weren't aware of that at first.  You have a heavy stride and have been told you stomp.  You sing quietly.
5. You used to let that manager's remote staff use your workstation, and put the sign there after you returned as you should have.
6. You told your manager you feel uncomfortable and unwelcome in the office now and she was very understanding and agreed that these were incredibly petty grievances. After she spoke to hr again, she said it seemed like they understood everything and agreed that this was very petty. They said they would tell the complainer that basically ""we all have to live together"" kinda thing and that those types of complaints need to be brought to my manager, not HR.

"[TN] I don’t know if it’s worth it to request a transfer TLDR at the bottom.

Hello! I am currently experiencing what I believe is possible retaliation at my workplace and I don’t know if it’s worth it to report to HR or if I can request to transfer to a different location.

Towards the end of March I had my annual review which went very well. I was told I was doing a fantastic job and that I am a very reliable and appreciated employee. I ended up receiving the maximum raise because I did so well in management’s viewpoint.

Fast forward to the end of April, I had a circumstance occur that I was sexually harassed by one of the company’s directors. I sent an email to management about it and was basically told to just tell him to leave me alone in the future and they swept it under the rug. 

Since then, I have had multiple circumstances occur that appear to be retaliation. A couple of weeks after the email was sent, I was given a verbal warning for “dress code violation” (my jacket had a hood). I checked the employee handbook and there is nothing stated in the dress code showing that I violated anything, in fact it specifically states we can wear jackets. The following week, a member of upper management falsely claimed to my direct supervisor that I was trying to deny service to customers when I did nothing of the sort and my boss knows I would never do something like that. My supervisor accused me of this and reprimanded me in front of other customers as well as my coworkers. A few days later my boss calls me on one of my days off to coach me about a mistake that was not solely my fault. I followed the written directions I was given but because I took the payment, it is solely my fault that documents were not scanned when I was under the impression that they were already (it’s whatever with this one, I’ll take responsibility for that, but my boss should not be calling me on my days off to talk about this stuff when I am not on the clock). 

Today, I was coached in front of customers and my coworkers AGAIN about a complaint that someone was having a personal conversation with coworkers while a customer was being helped. There is no identifying details of who it was but my boss singled me out and coached me over it. I asked my coworkers if he talked to any of them about this issue that worked the day this happened and they said he did not. 

I don’t know if I am reading into this too much, but the sudden change in behavior and sudden increase of micromanagement/coachings I have received since reporting the harassment appears to be retaliation to me. It has me concerned that they are looking for a reason to terminate me.

At this point, I am too afraid to talk to my manager about transferring to a different location because I think it will worsen things, so I was considering taking this to HR. If I were to report this and request to be transferred, would I just make this situation worse and get myself fired or would it potentially be worth it to try and go to a different location?

If you read all of that thank you. 

TLDR: I am worried my boss is retaliating against me because I reported a director to him for sexual harassment. It’s gotten to the point I want to transfer to a different location to get out of this, but I am afraid if I take this to HR and request a transfer it will worsen the situation and I could potentially be fired.

"[india] I withdrew my application but still got the interview - now I'm unsure what to expect Hi everyone,
I’m in a confusing but hopeful situation and could really use some perspective or advice.

A few weeks ago, I applied for a role I was genuinely excited about. After about 20 days of no updates, I decided to withdraw my application, thinking maybe getting referred by someone else would increase my chances.

I withdrew my application on a Tuesday. After that, I approached someone internally for a referral — but he said he couldn’t refer me since I was already in the system. I wasn’t sure if the withdrawal had properly processed, or if something else was preventing it.

Then something unexpected happened — on Thursday (just two days later), I received an interview invite from HR. I was surprised but thrilled and went ahead with the interview. It went really well, and I felt confident and optimistic afterward.

Now I’m wondering:

Could the earlier withdrawal affect my chances, even after a good interview?

Might the system flag me or create internal confusion with the hiring team?

Should I proactively mention this at any stage, or just wait it out?

Has anyone been through something similar, where a withdrawn application still led to an interview?

"[MI] FMLA Question Hello,

  
I have a profoundly disabled child who I qualify for FMLA for.  His doctor filled out the form and my HR approved it but only for appointments.  His pediatrician had selected on the form that due to the chronic conditions he has, I may have to be out on an intermittent basis for his care due to episodic flare ups.  She selected 3x a week up to 8 hours a day.  HR and whatever medical company they contract with are denying that portion of the FMLA form and saying I don't qualify for the intermittent care, even though it was selected on the form that they approved.   Just to give a little background of the diagnosis's that were listed on the FMLA form - autism, phelan-mcdermid syndrome, GERD (He has intense self injurious behaviors at times that make it unable for him to attend school and his GERD can act up, causing him to vomit which also makes him unable to attend school.  He was actually hospitalized for this last year for 2 days - cyclical vomiting).  I was told: ***""Intermittent leave for flares is leave time needed because the patient becomes incapacitated  (unable to participate in normal daily activities or functions) due to a ""flare"" of their medical condition.  So, for example, if someone has asthma, they may experience an asthma attack that limits their activity to bed only and unable to participate in normal activities.  While the child has significant, chronic medical issues, none of them listed by the provider would result in ""flares"".  The medical conditions listed by the provider are chronic but they do not fluctuate significantly in severity.  Flares have periods of remission, where there are no symptoms.  This is not the case for the medical conditions listed for this child.   Also, FMLA does not cover ""normal"" care for a child that any parent would provide to their child.""***

Can they pick and choose what they approve on the form? I don't understand how his doctor certified it and they are telling me no.  This has been SUCH a headache to deal with.  I even asked them if they could speak with his doctor (there was a section on a form I filled out that said they would be able to) and they said Nope, they just go by what is on the form (even though she had selected that portion).

"I’m very curious as to what forms were filled out and what, *specifically*, the doctor wrote. A diagnosis is not required on an FMLA document. Can you share what the doctor specifically said? The issue may be listing those diagnoses instead of just the symptoms that need you to be home with him. 

What they’re apparently arguing is that the conditions listed aren’t flareups, it seems to be his baseline. So they are trying to claim you aren’t taking time off to care for him during an exacerbation of his condition, you are wanting the time to care for him in general. 

It is unclear based on what you wrote if he attends school normally, and he would be staying home during times when he is more self-injurious or having worse GERD than normal, or if he does not attend school at all. If it’s the latter and you need to care for him, for example when your typical childcare falls through, that would not qualify for FMLA. If it’s the former and he does attend school, except for when situations with his health are flared up, that would qualify for FMLA, but taking those diagnoses off there might be helpful.",comment_1,r/AskHR,Professional,,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHR/comments/1ktnuj1/mi_fmla_question/

"A diagnosis is never needed, nor is the condition name. Just symptoms. To help understand why you were denied, we need a specific information. It’s probably the way it was worded on the certification forms. 

Under the section Part A: Medical Information, what did the physician say specifically for section 4 and for section 6? What boxes did they check for 5? Did they check the part for psychological comfort? That is a big part of being the parent to a child who’s ill, chronically or otherwise. If that wasn’t part of it, you need to make sure that is checked. 

I will be honest, I looked up the condition your child has, and I’m not entirely certain that this would qualify for anything other than doctor appointments, because these tend to be his baseline behaviors and health. That said, we absolutely would have approved you to err on the side of caution. 

Their argument is going to be that GERD isn’t considered a serious medical condition under FMLA because it’s not something that incapacitates someone, and self-injury is part of his normal behaviors, and don’t involve incapacitation. I can see them saying that because there’s no incapacity here, this is actually just you needing childcare. I disagree with that and think you should’ve been approved. Especially given the aspect of psychological care, because even if there isn’t a period of capacity, you’re tending to his psychological needs simply by being with him.",comment_4,r/AskHR,Professional,,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHR/comments/1ktnuj1/mi_fmla_question/

"[MA] is my employer violating the state paid sick time law? My question is whether my employer is violating the state paid sick time law by not allowing me or my colleagues to have any.

I am an emergency medicine physician outside Boston. I am paid monthly; my monthly salary is based on an agreement my employer and I make at the beginning of every year about how many total hours/shifts I will work over the year, divided by 12. For 2024 and 2025, I am paid to work 1500 hours in the ER, in nine-hour shifts.

My employer is the largest employer in the state. 

Last year, I was out a total of 27 hours due to personal illness. 

This year, I need to take off 36 hours over one week to take care of my wife, who is having surgery. 

Their opinion is that we are not entitled to any paid sick time at all because we have ""unlimited time off.""

So in some sense, I am salaried and in some sense, I'm sort of an hourly employee. If I worked extra hours over the course of the year, at the end of the year, I am paid extra.

My opinion is that this violates the state law. When I was out 27 hours last year, at the end of the year, they told me that I have 27 hours I have to make up because I was out sick. If I take 36 hours off to care for my wife, as recommended by her surgeon, their position is that I have to make up all of those hours. This would seem to contradict what the law mandates.

My reading of the state law simply says that everyone is entitled to up to 40 hours of paid sick time, outside of very limited exceptions, and that any company that does not follow it. This can have its own sick time benefit, but at a minimum, it has to be at least as generous as the state mandate.

My colleagues who work in a different department do not have to make up a sick day.

At my manager's prior emergency department, also in Massachusetts, they accrued sick time. At my moonlighting job, in another hospital system, I accrue sick time.

"Massachusetts law specifically says if there is another policy that allows time off that employees can use for sick leave, that satisfies the requirements.  That's what you have.  You can work 60 hours one week, take off the entire next week because you're sick and still get paid as long as you meet your contract requirements for the year.

"I9 Documentation [MO] Recently, my employer informed us that there’s an upcoming HR audit focused on I-9 compliance. In response, our HR department assigned hourly supervisors (including myself) the task of collecting identity verification documents from employees — things like Social Security cards, birth certificates, and passports.

To be honest, I’m extremely uncomfortable with this. I’m not trained in HR, and I don’t think it’s appropriate (or safe) for hourly supervisors to be responsible for handling such sensitive personal information. It feels like a huge liability risk — not just for me, but for the company as well.

Some employees have been here for over 10 years and are saying they already submitted their I-9 documents when they were hired. HR is now requesting these documents again, including from me — even though I know for a fact I completed mine during onboarding. How can a facility with over 300 employees not have I-9s on file? Isn’t that a major compliance issue?

Doesn’t USCIS require employers to retain I-9s for at least 3 years after hire or 1 year after termination, whichever is later? If so, what happened to all of those documents? Is it even legal for a company to operate with that many employees and not have their I-9s properly retained?

I’d appreciate any insight or advice on this — especially around: •	Whether hourly supervisors should be collecting sensitive documents •	What the employer’s legal obligations are for I-9 storage and retention •	How to protect myself from liability in this situation

[MO] can my boss withhold my pto if I turn in my two weeks after it has been scheduled? I live in Missouri and have been asking for my pto for the past several weeks since it expires at the end of the month and my company doesn’t do payouts. My boss knew I didn’t have any real plans so he keeps pushing it back and giving me one day a week but now I’m on my last week and still have several days of pto. A day or two ago I got a job off that’s significantly better than my current job so I need to turn in my two weeks tomorrow but an assistant manager told me he’s likely to withhold my pto in retaliation.

Using PTO during the two weeks would defeat the entire point.

However, given the combination of (1) them not paying out PTO upon term, (2) them not letting you use it prior to now even though you've tried, and (3) being told by management that they will revoke your only chance at using this PTO if you give notice, then I would advise quitting later on without any notice.

"[WA] Credit Score on Resume? [850 FICO] Background - I am currently on the job hunt like many. My focus is Business Marketing, Finance, and Consulting roles. Location: USA. I recently achieved a perfect 850 FICO score.

Given the current employment landscape, it seems like you have to target every possible angle to give yourself an edge. Every business role I see posted has literally hundreds of applicants within the first 24hrs. I live in a highly competitive area of the PNW which attracts global candidates to our many large tech companies.

**Should I include my 850 credit score on my resume?** 

People often refer to a high score as an achievement so I thought maybe I should add it to my bottom skills/awards section. My thinking was that because my field is in business then this might actually benefit me. Especially for roles in finance or the ultra-competitive world of consulting. I've heard by some that it may be advantageous as it shows responsibility and trustworthiness. Also it being a detail that is almost never included so it would make my resume stand out / be remembered. I've also heard it may come off as pretentious or odd.

I have been unable to find a definitive answer to this question. I'm posting this in several subs in the hopes of finding an answer. Maybe others who have either seen or done this can shed some light. Any thoughts or feedback is greatly appreciated.

A few times in my career this has happened to my employees. It's always gone the same way: let FMLA run out,  determine reasonable accommodation, do that until we can't,  reassess, mutually agree we can no longer accommodate, offboard cordially. Stay in touch. 

If you can't return to work for months, it's time to step away from the workforce. Good/decent companies will do everything within the law and beyond, truly until they can't manage it any more. And they probably need to operate with that position filled to stay open, so at a certain point the employee is usually aligned with the employer on that matter. It's easy to separate professionally after that. 

Most places I've worked have made it 6-8 months for non-officers/executives. At those levels, it's complicated and costly, so each case is unique. But individual contributors and low- to mid-level managers/leaders have duties that are easier to delegate or fill in with a temp. 

You might talk with your medical provider about seeing an occupational therapist if you're not sure what the future will look like work-wise, based on your reason for being out. If work is still in your future, they can offer some excellent recommendations that can make ADA conversations more productive.

* MySQL, Apache Tomcat
* Optional: IVR platforms (Avaya/Yellow.ai) — mostly for API integration

"[MI] Business Coaching Throwaway account. Reposting as prior was taken down possibly due to low karma.

A coworker and I were recently slotted to meet with my boss's business coach. I was told during a recent review at my work that I would need to seek career coaching to improve my salary. I am okay with that. Anyone can benefit from coaching.

The coach, let's call him Shane, sent me some onboarding information. In it was a flow chart discussing his philosophy. A few examples of the verbiage of his methods:

""At the center and core of ourselves is our True Self""  
""Being human, we experience Negative Influences that impact and imprint the True Self""  
""Our Ego mechanisms are how we react in response to false beliefs""  
""This {COACH METHOD} supports individuals in the healing and release of the negative patterns and beliefs of the False Self""

I think you get the gist of the type of philosophy he has.

In my onboarding paperwork he wanted to know of any boundaries I have and I said I do not want to discuss spiritual or deeply personal topics but I would love to know of ways to grow in my career.

Cut to the meeting. We had some pleasantries and back and forth. He then goes into discussing this methodology of knowing my True Self and breaking down fear, getting to our core etc. I told him I was uncomfortable with discussing these things and I would prefer to discuss them with a personal licensed therapist as they seem like non work related topics. I told him I wanted to focus on workplace coaching.

He told me we were not a good fit for coaching and he didn't think we could work together. He was professional and kind but said I have too many walls up against who I personally am to be helped by his coaching. He needed to know me more personally and I was too restrained.

One of the things I need coaching on according to my boss is emotional intelligence. I am rather reserved in the workplace and admittedly lack empathy. I like to keep my head down and stick to my job. I do come off a bit colder and blunt and it is something I am working on in my personal therapy. I have my own diagnosis that does mean I am more reserved and socially awkward but I do have a management position and have done well in business for a long time. To be clear, I work with numbers and not people. I am not in a field that requires substantial client contact or sales. I look at Excel mostly alone all day.

To my question, is refusing this type of coaching something that can be docked against my performance? Is this type of coaching appropriate to offer in the workplace? Can you suggest ways that I navigate having been ""fired"" by this coach? My boss does like this coach and meets with him regularly.

"When contacting references, can I ask what their work ethic is like and if they can be rehired?",comment_2,r/AskHR,Professional,,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHR/comments/1ktm5u7/contacting_references_mo/
"Depending on the size of the company, the person completing the reference might not be the person’s supervisor. It could be someone in HR or administration. If so they wouldn’t know the person’s work ethic. Also work a good work ethic means different things to different people and as the other poster said, they probably wouldn’t answer the question anyway. Most companies will say if the person is eligible for rehire or not so I would stick with requesting dates of employment, job title, and if they are eligible for rehire.",comment_3,r/AskHR,Professional,,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHR/comments/1ktm5u7/contacting_references_mo/

"[CA] I’m dealing with a situation where I could really use some outside perspective. How would you handle a compensation request from an employee who does solid work but shows low commitment?

I have an employee who consistently shows up to work on time, performs their tasks well, and is reliable.

However, over the past few months, they’ve made several comments that have raised concerns about their long-term commitment and alignment with the company:

•	“I’m only here for my coworkers.” •	“Another office has been reaching out to me.” •	“I’m not sure I even want to be here.”

In a recent meeting to discuss their request for a raise, I started by acknowledging the solid work they’ve done and letting them know I value their contribution. But before discussing compensation, I brought up the previous comments and asked directly:

“You’ve mentioned feeling frustrated with management in the past and that your main reason for staying is the relationships with a few coworkers. I respect your honesty, but I want to check in—do you still feel that way?”

The employee responded that yes, they are here primarily because of one coworker they respect and admire. When I asked what commitment looks like to them, they said it’s about showing up, doing the job, and completing tasks.

I explained that I was prepared to offer a raise and even a promotion—but that I needed to hear some level of personal commitment to the team and the direction we’re going. Instead, they got very emotional, quiet, struggling to find the words to respond and said they’d “need to think about it.”

So my questions are:

In your experience, how important is verbal buy-in or emotional commitment when considering raises and promotions?

•	If someone is doing the job but is disengaged from the team or leadership, is that enough to justify advancement?

•	Would you interpret this as non-committal behavior?",post,r/AskHR,Professional,5.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHR/comments/1ktbw5p/ca_im_dealing_with_a_situation_where_i_could/
"I was considering changing jobs. Do you know what got me to stay? A big fat raise. Turns out I had a price and my employer found it. Does it buy my loyalty / commitment forever? No. But it rebalanced my salary to be more in line with what other companies pay so makes it more worthwhile for me to stay. 

If this person does good work and you want them to stay then give them a raise. No one is committing to a company in lieu of money. Or they shouldn’t be.",comment_1,r/AskHR,Professional,,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHR/comments/1ktbw5p/ca_im_dealing_with_a_situation_where_i_could/
"Personally, my idea of commitment is exactly what this employee is doing- doing their job well, doing it on time, and overall being reliable. Expecting anything more seems a little unrealistic, as most of the population is working because they have to, not because they want to. It seems like you're expecting 110% from the employee instead of the 100% that they've proven they can give. I've had a situation like this with management, and to be honest, I left that job the second I could. I find this attitude from management to be draining from the perspective of the employee- you want me to do a nearly perfect job, and then give you some more?

If they're as good an employee as you make it seem, I think a pay raise would be worth it on your end, to avoid the risk of them leaving and then you have to find another employee as good as them. You might unintentionally end up in a situation where you didn't realize how good they were until you're forced to hire a sub-par replacement.

As far as their comments, I'd have a sit down with them- why do they feel that way about management? What can you, as management, do better? If you're seriously considering moving to another office, can you tell me why, and maybe I can make some changes? Those conversations are what keep me with my current company- the openness with management, and the willingness to talk about any problems or concerns. Just having that conversation with this employee may make them a little more willing to stay, as it shows you're still willing to grow, even in a position of power.

Edit: I've read your reply about the coworker contributing to toxic behavior, which complicates it a bit. If they're so toxic that they're making other people miserable, then you may have to decide whether or not they're good enough to risk the morale of your other employees (and most employees aren't worth that risk in my opinion).

"i don’t interpret it as non-committal because most people are not committed to their employer in the first place. the vast majority of workers are there to make a living, not for the love of the craft or loyalty to the company. most anyone would leave the job they’re in now for one that pays better. especially with COL so high in CA. if he’s a top talent, you’ll have a better chance of retaining him if you pay him more.

the better question to ask is what’s the gamble you’re more prepared to make: no raise and hope he stays anyway, or bump up his pay and he leaves?

it’s worth considering the time and money it will cost to recruit and train a replacement if he were to leave vs. the cost of the pay increase. what cost are you more willing to pay? bearing in mind that hiring a replacement doesn’t guarantee that that person will stay either.",comment_5,r/AskHR,Professional,,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHR/comments/1ktbw5p/ca_im_dealing_with_a_situation_where_i_could/
"[TX] 54 years old- laid off and work refuses to give OWBPA report 
I was laid off on Monday. Eight others were as well (company size is 75). 6 out of the 8 were over 40 or female (and one guy in a wheelchair). Pretty much everyone left is a young guy. 

The Friday before I was laid off, my manager told me not to pay overtime to people who had worked it, because we had gone over our budgeted labor costs. He also wanted me to pay a few guys under the table, when I know they have back child support garnishments. I took screenshots of this. 

I declined, but tried to be professional about it. On Monday I was fired and told it was because we are in a tough spot because of tarrifs, etc and need to cut costs. 

I got a severance offer for 2 weeks pay, but I've worked there for 18 months and that felt way too light to me, since it felt like I was really just being punished for not going along with shady things. 


When they fired me, I told them about how I felt (nicely) and said the timing was odd. 2 workdays before I got fired, they booked my travel to go to a trade show, so it really looks shady...like this wasn't the plan until I raised those issues. 

I very nicely responded to the offer and said I would like 1 month (which I know they have given to other people in similar roles when we closed locations) and laid out my concerns. And I said they didn't give me my OWBPA disclosure. 

That's something my partner received a few years ago and I had never heard of before. But I understand what it is, and I should have received it. But the company has no HR, so I think they don't know what to do. 

It's been a few days. I emailed them again today and said that I'd found a box in my garage that had some materials in it that belonged to the company, so I sent it in with my buddy who is a vendor for them. (Nothing expensive, just like $30 in branded junk like coozies and notebooks.) and then I politely asked for the disclosure again. 

They can't just never respond right? And I'd be silly to sign this if they continue to refuse to provide it. And even if I do sign, I could still file a complaint because the disclosure is required before accepting severance. 

If I'm betting, they're working with their lawyer to figure out the disclosure since they never do it. But it's been days and I don't like that. 

The agreement does say I have 21 days to think it over and I'm not super worried about them yanking the first offer away from me because I know that looks even worse.

"[UK] TUPE advice [UK] Hello, TUPE advice needed please.

I work for a limited liability partnership (LLP). At the start of March 2025 all 6 of the Partners resigned and 2 new partners were appointed.

To date there has been no official consultation with us and both my employer and the new company are saying that TUPE has not happened and that the process hasn't started yet.

"OT pay & exemption question [WA] I work as in the facilities dept for our church/school.  During the school year we offer tuition assistance in exchange for janitorial work.  I supervise the work scholarship families which accounts for over 80 hours per week of work.  But in the summer they do not work.  I manage about 60 hours of workers per week in the summer. All of the workers get W-2’s.

My assumption is that this would require a reclassification during the summer which would remove the executive exemption until the program starts again.  Thus I would be entitled to overtime.  Is this correct?

"Yes. Essentially type in ""COBRA notification"" timeframes, with some nuance:

* Employers have 30 days to notify the plan administrator (the plan administrator can be the employer or a third party)
* And the admin has 14 days to notify the employee
* Then 60 days to elect coverage

That's the short-answer. There's some variation there and **some states offer mini-COBRA** outside of federal COBRA. Then federal vs state COBRA may offer from 12 months of coverage up to 36 months.

""Other separation information"" you mention in the title varies by state.

"[NY] Boss is sexually harassing my BF and I, & HR thinks it’s funny (TL;DR I’m a gig-based employee and my HR department is sexually harassing my bf and I, and also decides how often we work)

So my long-term boyfriend and I(26m) have worked at this catering company for almost 4 years, as gig-based employees. We have a relatively new “head of booking” who basically decides when and how often we are booked to work. He has been heavily flirting with me for months, such as referring to me as “edible” in a message once, and frequently invites my boyfriend and I to bars, clubs, and parties both in person and in text messages, when we’ve never given him our phone numbers.

This culminated in our staff holiday party this December, where he announced over a microphone to the entire staff that my bf and I are “open.” (Which is true, but we don’t tell most people, certainly never told him and must have heard it from other staff.) Then at the same party, straight up asked us to have a threesome with him. We since have heard of other male staff that he has made advances on and continues similar behavior with us.

Our head of HR is an interesting player in this, because she formally was the head of booking, and still basically is in all but title, with the current HOB being more like her assistant. She has been known to retaliate in the past against staff for reporting SH by severally cutting their bookings. And it’s easy for her to claim it’s all “based on the needs of the events.”

At the staff holiday party, it was made apparent that she is aware that our booker is interested in my bf and I, with a number of comments, the worst of which, her trying to laugh off with us the fact that the booker announced our relationship status to the whole staff.

So I’d really like to report both of them, but I don’t exactly see how I can report HR to HR, especially when the unspoken implication is she already knows and will retaliate if I make it a “problem.” I really enjoy my job aside from dealing with the two of them. I was gonna just try and just deal with it, but already suspect retaliation because my booking has decreased noticeably both compared to other staff and this time last year.

"""Gig"" work? Are you getting a W2 or are you a 1099 Contractor? 

You have stated he's flirting, where did you tell him to stop? Ignoring isn't telling someone to stop. You have to tell him his advances are unwelcome and are making you uncomfortable. 

I'm sorry that this is happening but what you're explaining hasn't really reached the classic thresholds of sexual harassment in the workplace. 

You haven't given him your number, why haven't you blocked him? Inviting you to go out isn't harassment. It sounds like a shitty standard food-services situation you're caught up in. And I'll be honest with you, since you're relatively young, that's full of people screwing around with each other, even between those in higher levels of jobs.

I was out of the loop on what pickups we were expecting when a truck arrived and I asked said coworker if he knew what the pickup was for. 
We work slightly different hours and one of my 10 minutes breaks was right at the moment. 
I was willing to wait to take the break later if he needed help, and after he met with the driver proceeded to ask if he had it covered. 
Coworker proceeded to snap and call me an asshole and curse at me in front of another one of our coworkers and told me I could, “you can fucking load it yourself.”

He continued this tirade as I walked away and I decided that, yes, I’m going to take my break and go speak to my manager.
I informed her and took my break before heading back to our dock to continue work. 
As soon as I approached, he immediately continued where he left off and continued cursing at me.

"[MS] workplace retaliation (?) Okay bear with me, I need your best advice…


In August 2022 I merged my company with another , larger company. 
As part of the merger I was given a 4 year employee contract that included an annual bonus of $20k , which was to be used to pay off lingering taxes or debts , licenses, fees from the sale/my previous company. My job title was now Director and I reported to the CEO.

I was never formally introduced to the leadership team. However, in 1:1 meetings the CEO would direct me to meet with others to establish various plans to smoothly integrate processes through the merger and continue growth. I was not received well in these meetings. However, the new company has terrible employee reviews and is known to be a toxic work environment. So, I took nothing personal, used empathetic statements constantly, and powered through the microaggressions, focusing on the end goal.

In just months, by late October 2022, it was clear we were facing revenue issues. I had clients reporting to me that they had been receiving services for months and never received a bill or made payment. Then, in January of 2023 , my department went to file new authorizations for services and found that our funder portals had been shut down. They were shut down in October of 2022 by the new company. However, the billing department did not communicate this to my department. Therefore all services that we provided through this funder since October 2022 would not be paid. I reported this in my next meeting with the CEO and my frustration over the lack of communication. He told me it’s my job to meet with the billing team and CFO to get this worked out. 

Meeting with CFO and billing: They basically shut me down completely, I ask for reports on client accounts and claims paid. They tell me they will try to find a way to get me that information (hint: they never do). They tell me that they did close the one funder account but don’t worry they can just transfer the authorizations to their account. I ask if they have initiated the transfer: NO. I am told the billing person will initiate transfer.

Fast forward, billing person required 3 follow up’s from my team to initiate the transfer. Months later we find out she did it wrong. Meanwhile, we still are losing significant revenue every month due to this situation. In leadership meetings I am being chastised for the lack of revenue. Since the CFO has been so icy towards me, myself and my team just go behind the scenes and fix the authorizations ourselves , which took a full 60 hours of work each for myself and another employee. We fix it, we tell billing they can now back bill to January, but unfortunately due to the funder rules, all revenue from October to January is lost. This is approximately $70k.

I keep doing my job. I keep being ridiculed by the CFO in leadership meetings about how my department is “in the red”. I keep my mouth shut and do my job because I’m not petty.

Summer rolls around and I do not receive my bonus. Then September’s comes and I receive a notice on taxes due for my prior business. I call the CEO to ask how can we handle this because it is an astronomical amount that I obviously cannot pay on my salary. He tells me go talk to an attorney. Basically, deal with it myself. Attorneys all want to charge $500 consultation so I hold off and talk to our board president. He talks to CEO. They say they will find a way to work this out they do not want me to be stressed out while trying to grow my department. Then, a wage garnishment is issued. It states 15 days to respond. I call CEO. He says get a loan. Somehow I’m super lucky and a friend agrees to loan me the $20k with no interest, to pay the taxes immediately. I call the CFO to ask if I can meet with her. She says no. I call CEO and tell him what is going on. He says okay let me talk to her. I hear nothing back by end of business day. I’m prepared to go down to the state office the next morning to pay the taxes. I email CFO right before I leave work for the day telling her I plan to go pay the taxes in the morning. She writes back saying “you shouldn’t do that. We sent the signed garnishment in on Monday (day it was delivered) that is company policy.” Payday is Friday and she states that my wages will be garnished starting Friday. The garnishment is so large that I will not be able to pay my rent. 

Anyways, this has an incredibly awful impact on my life but I keep pressing on and coming into work with a positive attitude and doing my job. Find out CFO is in charge of distributing my bonus.

Still encounter issues with other leadership members when trying to work through merger but I let things go because at this point I’m just trying to survive financially and legally without allowing the situation to impact my children. 

Now it’s April 2024 and we are getting ready to open a second location for my department specifically. This has created some animosity amongst the other leadership positions because ‘why does the new girl get all of this new stuff when we’ve been asking for decades”… 

I continue to do my job. At this point the CEO has demoted me because I am struggling to get tasks completed due to the interpersonal relations. For example, marketing won’t make media for open positions in my department. I reported exactly what happened and was told their behavior was wrong and I did not do anything wrong. But still, I am the one being demoted. CEO frames it as he is moving me to meet for 1:1s with someone else who can possibly help me more because he is out of town too much. However, I move down 3 rungs on organizational chart. Person I’m reporting to has way less experience than me. But anyways I’m okay with it because maybe she can get buy in from other employees.

Now, I am told to send a list to concerning parties about items needing to be completed before opening new location. One item is for the CFO and billing team. CFO responds to my email to say that the company doesn’t do that. I try to call her to discuss, she does not answer. I send follow up email and it is ignored. Meanwhile next leadership meeting I get called out by CEO about our lack of revenue. At this point I’m getting frustrated. 

I meet with my supervisor and discuss the reason why my department is in the red. Then I approach the topic of the task needing completed for the new location. She says she will discuss with CFO. Another month goes by, task is not completed. Now my authorizations are expiring again and cannot be renewed due to this lingering task. I ask my supervisor again if this has been followed up on. She tells me to try to work around it and provide emails from funder reps stating what needs to be done. This takes me a lot of time but I do it. Another month passes. 

I decide to just email the CEO and COO and explain the task needing completed, the issues it is causing, why we lost $70k in revenue which put us in the red, and how I would like to prevent this from happening a second time. I also ask for open communication. COO emails me back to basically say “stay in your lane, we are aware, you did your part, don’t ask again”. Meanwhile, I still cannot complete the new authorizations because this task has not been completed.

Now we are coming up on my second annual bonus. Of course I’m nervous because I still have federal taxes now to pay off but what if CFO is mad that I brought this issue up? I check my contract again. It says I should be paid my $20k bonus annually within 10 days of the Anniversary of my start date. I don’t receive it within those 10 days. I do end up receiving it later but I had to ask HR multiple times and I was coldly reminded that my department is in the red.

Now I’m just frustrated that all these really small tasks are so difficult to complete due to other members of leadership being unwilling to collaborate with me. I considered going to HR to file a complaint and even typed one up. My biggest concern is that I’m still being blamed for being in the red even though  the loss is due to the finance/billing department. However, after typing up an eloquent complaint, I realized that the Director of HR reports to the CFO…

"[NY] To give two weeks notice or not? This is the tech industry, in case it makes a difference.

I started a job less than a year ago. It has mostly been bad, recently I got a negative performance review from my manager, which I thought was unfair. I applied for other jobs and got one. I have signed the offer.

The main portion of the company (including my manager) is not based in the US.

I am currently on a work trip. The purpose of the trip (in theory) is like team-bonding because we're based in separate parts of the world. I will be back in NY on May 29th.

I start my new job on July 1st. I would like to maximize time off in between this job and the next job. I have vacation scheduled for June 2nd and 3rd. My manager has already been informed and I cannot cancel it.

The employee handbook requests two weeks of notice.

The options are:

1. Give notice right now, while on the work trip, risking a potential flight cancellation? (seems unlikely but always possible). Also risking an unpleasant remainder of the trip.

2. Give notice when I return from the trip, telling them that I'm happy to leave off working immediately if they'd prefer. This would eat into time that I hoped to take off.

3. Return from the trip and quit with no notice. I am not sure precisely what bridges this would burn. The coworkers that like me already know, and the manager already doesn't like me. I do not intend to return to work at this company. I mostly do not like other upper management as well. They have also not been particularly respectful of me, so I don't see a reason not to return in kind.

4. Return from the trip and quit with reduced notice. (maybe a week?)

"[VA] FMLA & Short-Term Disability: Return to Work My partner has been on FMLA and Short-Term Disability concurrently for the last 4 weeks, and was originally planning on returning to work on Tuesday, 5/27. After the medical facility where he is seeking treatment suggested he stay an additional week, the new plan was for him to be picked up on Wednesday, 5/29 (the facility is out-of-state and we will not return until the following day) and return to work on Monday, 6/2. However, the medical facility is telling him that if he is discharged on Wednesday 5/29, then he must return to work the very next day after discharge in order for it to be covered by FMLA and short-term disability.

Given that he will be continuing to receive care from other healthcare providers for the same condition after he is discharged from the current facility, what is the issue with having 2 business days between being discharged and returning to work? If he is still experiencing the medical issue and seeking care and has only exhausted 4.5 weeks of FMLA, doesn’t it not matter whether he is in inpatient care or not?

* The smart and lazy I make generals. They also know what to do, but they’re not going to waste energy doing what doesn’t need to be done.

I asked him politely if he could switch on his camera too and he laughed and straight up said ""No, not exactly"". Then he asked me to remove my video background filter.

"Companies use abstract reasoning tests because they want to know if you can spot patterns, think logically, and solve problems without needing specific training or prior experience. They’re not testing what you know—they’re testing how you think.

Imagine starting a job with minimal guidance. Can you figure things out on your own? That’s the core of abstract reasoning. These tests are like logic puzzles—shapes, sequences, patterns—that measure how quickly and accurately your brain processes new information.

Here’s why it matters:
Abstract reasoning tests have a predictive validity of 0.51, meaning they’re one of the most reliable ways to predict job performance. That’s backed by decades of research across industries.

How do they compare to other hiring tools?

Work samples / case studies – 0.54

Abstract reasoning / cognitive tests – 0.51

Structured interviews – 0.51

Job knowledge tests – 0.48

Situational judgment tests (SJTs) – 0.34

Assessment centers – 0.37

Unstructured interviews – 0.38

Personality tests (Big 5) – 0.22

Years of experience – 0.18

Education level – 0.10

Employers use abstract reasoning because it’s quick, scalable, and one of the most consistent indicators of who can learn, adapt, and solve problems on the job.

I followed up after a week. They said several interviews had been postponed and they’d make a decision after another two weeks — even though the role supports a key launch by end of July.

If they truly believed I was the right fit, why delay at such a critical time? And if their own onboarding plan required someone to start immediately, wouldn’t it make more sense to move forward?

"Officially homeless Well, I am officially homeless at least mostly due to losing my job. 

There were 3 things that came together. I got wrapped up in a bad investment that I was chasing to recover the money which cost a lot of money. My contract job ended January 2024 and have been struggling to find another job. I was living with a friend and that house had to be suddenly sold and I couldn't move with. If even 1 of these things didn't happen I think I would have been ok. 

I moved in with some family friends for a month but they are retired with very limited income. No hard feelings as they can't afford to house me. 

All of this adds up to me being homeless. I am in emergency housing in a bad hotel. I am at totsl mercy of the state. This is bad. 

I am just venting. I am keeping my head high and continuing with job search.

"major red flags at interview .

 Recruiter call went ok but seemed a little pushy.  Wanted an in person interview asap ""Can you come in today?""  Since it was local, I said sure.

Went into the company office and the interviewer/manager walks me to the conference room, meanwhile pointing out how she designed all aspects of the office, how much she paid for each decor item, how everyone who visits states that it is beautiful etc.      

I'm like, ok..  So then. interview.  immediately she tells me ""we are a family here"". And I'm on my guard like uh oh.

She tells me the job is 9-5, but on call every night and weekend. So basically, on call 24/7. asked what happens if you call me at 2am, and I don't answer. She said ""why wouldn't you answer"" Me: ""sleep""  her: Are you a heavy sleeper or something?

I stated that I don't think id fit into a job where I can never have guaranteed off time. She then states that she rarely sleeps, works all the time and even brings her phone into the bathroom with her when she showers so she never misses a call.

Then she asks if I have a husband or kids, because they can cause issues with employees missing work etc.   

At this point Im like ""well, it was nice talking to you, this job won't be a fit for me, have a nice afternoon"".  Then she launches into a tirade about how nobody wants to work these days and its so hard as an employer to get workers blah blah blah

"I just want a job. I'm not even asking for a dream anymore. Just a chance. I've been rejected more times than I can count, and not once did I feel like I was really given a chance to prove myself. I've spent six years prepping to break into this industry—building, learning, hoping. And every time I get close, it’s like the floor shifts. COVID. Sanctions. Economic collapse. Political games played over the ruins of trade deals that existed for decades. The world changed, and I couldn’t keep up. The market has broken my confidence, I barely recognize myself over the creeping imposter syndrome and self-doubt. Every compliment feels like a jab. Every ""better luck next time"" feels like skill issue. 

It’s not fair. I know life isn’t fair. But damn—it really doesn’t let up.

I’m not here to be angry or emotional or dramatic. I just want to work. I want to use what I’ve built, what I’ve learned, what I’ve survived, and turn it into something that matters. I don’t want a badge or a “dream role.” I just want a damn opportunity to stand on my own, and maybe lift the people who gave up so much so I could try. I don't want to let them down.

I love engineering. I love research. I love building prototypes and trying to make something useful, even if it’s weird and messy and doesn’t scale yet. I want to do something that changes the world, bigger than myself. Maybe that's childish. Idk. I feel like I don’t even know where to begin anymore.

Every rejection chips away at me. Every “thank you for applying” email feels like someone laughing at the six years of effort I poured into this path. Leetcode? I practice. AI? I study. Degrees? Got two. Straight A’s. Networking? I reach out. I show up. I get referrals. I keep trying.

And the loop continues:
Prepare → Apply → Rejected → Repeat.

It’s hard not to feel like I’ve wasted all this knowledge. I believed in “impact.” I believed in trying to be useful. And now I feel like a fool for it. Maybe I’m not an engineer. Maybe I’m just a very persistent imposter who never knew when to quit.

I don’t know what I’m hoping for posting this. Maybe someone out there’s in the same boat and reads this and thinks, “Yeah, I feel that too.” Maybe that’s enough. Because right now I just feel stuck, tired, and more uncertain than ever.

I’ll keep going, I guess. Because I don’t know what else to do. 

But if anyone out there has made it to the other side—how?
How do you keep believing in something that doesn’t seem to believe in you?

"Just say no to one-way interviews I applied to a marketing job for a fashion/e-commerce startup that looked interesting. It seemed like a good match for my background, but the job description had limited information on the company, responsibilities, and compensation package (literally no mention of salary, despite being located in a state where employers are required to disclose a range). Red flag number one!

I heard back pretty quickly (within a few hours). They requested an interview, but as I kept reading, I realized it’s a one-way interview. Ugh!

One-off application questions that require a video response are bad enough, but this is on another level. By their own admission — estimated time is 55 minutes 🙄

I responded letting them know that I’m happy to set up a call. They wrote back with a condescending note about how they want to “get my vibe” (?) so they need a video uploaded instead of just having an actual conversation (??). Obviously if they can’t set aside 15 minutes for a screening call, there’s no way these clowns are sitting through an hour’s worth of video responses per applicant.

As you can see, I had some fun in my response.

"Second interview (coffee chat) after a VP interview at a big bank — haven't heard back. Tips ? I recently applied for a position at one of the big banks and, to my surprise, got contacted for an in-person interview pretty quickly. The first interview was at a branch and lasted about an hour with both a recruiter and a VP. The recruiter said I’d hear back in 3 weeks, but when he stepped out, the VP told me it would likely be closer to 2 weeks — so I figured I’d just wait it out.

But then the next day, I got a call inviting me to meet the **same VP again**, this time for an **informal coffee chat**. Recruiter mentioned the first interview was “only an hour” and that VP didn’t get to ask everything she wanted to. The following week, we met at a local coffee shop, and the vibe was much more relaxed. She asked me a lot of personal questions about my background and interests — not too much technical or role-specific talk.

At the end, she told me she still has two more candidates to speak with by the end of this week (it's Saturday now, the coffee chat was on Wednesday). Before we parted ways, she reminded me I have her email and said I could reach out if I had any questions.

Some context: I’ve only been working in banking for about 4 months, and this would be my first position in finance **outside of retail banking**. I’m a little anxious because I don’t have much experience, so I’m trying to read between the lines here.

"I want to give up(But I won't) Im sure this same sentiment has been shared many times here but oh well. I worked hard, did multiple internships, a research position at my Uni, trained my interviewing skills, had my resume checked, applied to around 400 entry level jobs, and yet here I am freshly graduated with no job offers.

Its especially frustrating when dealing with the recruiting process, which from talking to people who graduated even just 4-5 years ago has gotten significantly worse. I had a recruiter last week respond to my application to schedule an interview, I of course immediately responded and offered some times I was available, got ghosted, followed up the next week and still nothing. Another job had me do some stupid assessment that took around 3 hours, as well as 10 asynchronous video interview questions(oh my god I hate these more than anything), this was over a month ago and crickets from them even after politely asking for a status update. Beyond all that nonsense, I would estimate that only 10-20% of applications even get a rejection. As much as i hate the automated rejection emails, can you at least tell your robot to send one my way when the role is filled? 

I try to take the advice of those around me (your young you have time, keep applying, you will find something eventually), but I cannot shake the feelings of despair and sadness that this job search has brought me. I will, of course keep trying because what else can I do, but after doing everything ""the right way"" and having this be the end result is truly depressing.

Sounds like a vibe check. I would suggest preparing at least three relevant questions for each of their positions depending on the personality type of the interviewer. You may only get the chance to ask one question if they like to talk or you may get the chance to ask all three if they are the type of person who is concise and to the point. This would be a good use of AI. I would upload the job description and the titles of the interviews and ask AI to give you 3 operational questions for each. This way you can fill the 15 mins and stay engaged.

"Should I reach out to nightmare boss for a reference (he offered on the day they let me go) 
Hello all.

I have the close opportunity to work in an engineering role that I studied directly within my undergraduate which is mechanical engineering! 

 I have passed the 2nd stage and now the third stage is next week where I will be on site to meet the team. 

HR has been really good to me and wanting to “fast track” and make the whole process as easy as possible for me.  


The problem I have now is references. I need standard 2. So I have chosen my supervisor who happens to be a doctor in engineering who didn’t hesitate to “vouch” for me and basically support me which is great. He was an awesome supervisor and I trust him and anything he says about me as I now it will be positive. 

The second reference I need is from the previous job. I have reached out to 3 colleagues who I trust the most to speak highly on my behalf, one including my mentor (you can go through my history to see more of his behaviour) but I trust him the most. 
I understand it’s now the weekend and to be patient but I just want to get it out of the way.

None of them have gotten back to me. It’s been 3 days and I have sent my mentor a follow up message for reference to make things easier and to no avail. 

I really do not want to contact by ex boss again. Truly. My mentor warned me against my boss and my manager. Before I was let go, my ex boss said that he can act as reference for me but that was about it.

What should I do? I really need to round up refernaces soon and I am more or less ready to work (though there hasn’t been any deadline but they have been obviously pressing on it).",post,r/recruitinghell,Professional,2.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/recruitinghell/comments/1kukzmw/should_i_reach_out_to_nightmare_boss_for_a/
"Why do they ask references even before onsite. I dont think your mentor willing to give you references. It’s usually 3 days if they want to help you, in 2025 they have access to internet and most ppl check their email once a day. I think you should find someone else, peer is still okay.

"If a hiring manager asks “Why should we hire you?”, that should be a red flag 🚩 Hear me out. From experience; while “Why should we hire you?” seems like a standard question on the surface- it isn’t. Yes, the hiring process can be intense and so is the competition for the role, but that question indicates that the hiring manager has a holier than thou attitude, will have extremely high expectations if they DO select you, and that they’re not approachable, let alone easy to work for. They couldn’t care less about hiring you and you’re just wasting their time. Your boss isn’t your friend, but you should never have an anxiety attack before approaching them for simple questions.

"Technology: AI, and automation.

Economy: Macro-economic conditions related to inflation (COVID economic fallout). It’s more expensive to get lending due to higher interest rates. Businesses largely use lending to expand and/or even complete projects (example: a company contracts you to manufacture $1M worth of product. They don’t pay you until delivery, so you take $1M out in lending to complete the work.)

Offshoring: using cheap offshore labor is increasingly prevalent.

"Manager too busy for the interview This is perhaps the worst interview I've ever had.

The interview was set up with the Engineering Manager via the HR department.  First stage is a Teams interview.  I asked HR if it could be in person since I literally work in the building opposite, they said no, has to be teams.

I waited in the teams meeting for 25 minutes and nobody else joined.  I left and emailed the EM to let him know that technical problems happen and I'm sure that's the reason nobody joined.

He called me, asked why we were bothering with teams since I work so close, why didn't I just arrange to come in person.

Arranged the interview for the next day during my lunch.  Called 30 minutes before to confirm (in maintenance so your lunch isn't always the same time, depends on breakdowns and such)

Got to the security gate for their site with ten minutes to spare, pushed the buzzer, no answer.  Tried for five minutes, no answer.

Called the number from the ""if no answer call this number"" sticker.  A random woman answered, told me it's been happening for years, she asked if I could take the sticker down for her since the company haven't. (I didn't, didn't want to be seen peeling stickers when I'm waiting for an interview)

Called the EM, he told me to keep trying the buzzer

A random guy walked past and just let me in.  Once I got in, the security guard stopped me and asked what I was doing.  I got shitty, told him what was going on and that I'd been ringing the buzzer for ages.  He'd been on the toilet (maybe 20 minutes at that point) so he didn't hear.

Pointed vaguely towards an unmanned reception across a busy yard full of FLTs.  I went in there and called the EM again, he told me someone was coming.  Ten minutes go by, my lunch break is essentially over at this point, then the engineering team leader showed up and walked me through to the workshop.

Here the kicker, he knocked on the EMs door, who then said I'd have to come back, he was too busy to interview that day.  The same guy I'd spoken to repeatedly at that point.

Team leader sat down with me for a bit and asked some stuff but I'd completely stopped caring about my answers at that point.  He asked if I want to come back another day, I politely told him no, and the reasons why.  He at least looked suitably embarrassed.

The next day, their HR called me to ask how it went, I gave them the full story and withdrew my application

Tldr: One missed teams meeting, terrible policy enforcement, awful site security, hopeless comms, zero regard for health and safety, no professionalism or respect.  0/10",post,r/recruitinghell,Professional,11.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/recruitinghell/comments/1ku6rxe/manager_too_busy_for_the_interview/

"I had this the other day. Had a job interview for technically 2 jobs. 1 managerial role and 1 working in a junior position for the team of managerial role.

The feedback was that I didn't have enough experience for the managerial job, but had too much for the junior role and would likely get bored...

"Bullet Dodging or ""Learning Process"" I actually had an interview today at a local company, where my bsf also works at. Posting was done for the role of HR Intern.

The interview started a few mins late due to some prior commitment of the interviewer.

Had 2 people take the interview (Hiring Manger and a HR). They asked general/basic questions to ask an intern. Answered them in as simple and clean as possibilly I could.

The sad part came during the salary negotiation it was way below the market rate, eg. If market rate is 100-150 USD/month, they were offering 25 USD/month. Also glorifying Saturday working and work timings from 10:00-19:00hrs. The salary rate was justified by saying we are providing a ""learning experience"" and an ""IMAX screen to how HR works.""

Which according to local labor regulations cross the 48hr limit and no OT(Overtime) was mentioned about it.

I am kinda stuck in a situation where this Sat working these shit culture is Normalised here.

Also for readers wondering location -> India.

"Adam Robinson; founders against birth and birth related implications Beautiful Saturday morning reading some fresh cringe from the lolcow of cringe himself Adam Robinson!

This is the 3rd or 4th time for myself personally running into a completely irrelevant pointless story from Adam that is made to flex his ego in one form or another. The last one I saw a few months back was a video of him talking about being at a rooftop party where they were having a founder mixer of some sort. One of the founders very beautiful wife asked him how many employees they have and when he mentioned like 3 or 4 she said “oh you guys are just starting out?” He proceeds to go into a fragile masculinity rant saying his small lean teams do SO much more ARR per person and are so lean and efficient blah blah blah. It was funny af to see him triggered like that, but I mean not surprising from his female hair like appearance. Another one from the other day was him flexing spending 60 to 75k a month as his monthly family expenses.

Today we have Diana Ross CRO of retention or rb2b or something. Proud of being on the computer closing deals less than 24 hours after giving birth to her first human. This is everything wrong with the corporate world and grind mindset today. Skin on skin contact? No thanks. And probably no breastfeeding because of Adderall, her kids are likely just raised from birth by their Phillipino nanny.

Adam if you read this, this is lame as fuck and you are lame as fuck. Get a haircut and grow up you ceo founder man child lmao

"If the company wants you, the final round’s just vibes... After doing a few more interviews, I slowly realized:  
**If a company really wants you, they won't make you jump through hoops.**

When the recruiter sees you as the right fit, the conversation feels easy. They smile, nod, and mostly just want to know what you’ve done. Even if you're nervous, they’ll help you feel calm. You just need to tell your story.

But when they don’t want you? Everything you do seems wrong. 

\- You speak with energy, you're “too pumped.” 

\- You take a few second to think, they call you “not prepared.”

\- Even drinking water can feel like a mistake.

At that point, no perfect answer can change their mind. Even if you have an interview assistant by your side, it won’t matter if they alr decided.

So if an interview feels like a fight from the start—maybe it’s not your fault.  
**The right company, yes THE ONE will make space for you to shine.**

Has anyone else noticed this actually? What’s your “they never wanted me anyway” interview moment",post,r/interviews,Professional,456.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/interviews/comments/1ku2fm2/if_the_company_wants_you_the_final_rounds_just/
"Man, do I have a story for you.

I interviewed for a Director of Business Development role—great pay, solid company, and I really thought I’d fit in well. First interview was with the Director of Recruiting, who I’d be working closely with. It went great. Then came the VP of Operations…

That interview was supposed to be 60 minutes. It turned into 3 HOURS. Why? Because 2 hours of it were about her—her kid, her life, and how amazing it is that the company lets her work from anywhere in the U.S. It felt more like a TED Talk than an interview. You could tell immediately she loved the sound of her own voice and needed to feel above everyone else.

After that, I got hit with two assessments:
	1.	A 2-hour psychological test analyzing basically everything about me.
	2.	A resume submission “test” using their formatting, down to the font size and spacing between words. It took 4 days of back and forth just to get it “approved.” She would reject it for things like an extra space after a period.

Final interview with the President was quick—30 minutes—and I got an offer the next week. Started two weeks later.

I was brought in to lead and rebuild the Business Development department. They hadn’t landed new business in over 2 years. Sounded like a great challenge… until Day 1.

VP of Ops (my direct supervisor) tells me, “Everything you know about Business Development is wrong. Forget it.” I was told I’d have to completely relearn “their” way over the next 6 months. Cool, whatever, except then the micromanagement started.

Here’s what I had to do DAILY, without fail:
	•	Announce on chat when I started, went to lunch, came back, and ended my day.
	•	Update my LinkedIn with the company phone, email, branding—and send screenshots to prove it.
	•	Invite the entire company to connect with me on LinkedIn.

I didn’t do the LinkedIn part, and guess what? I was gone in under 4 weeks.

Oh, and since it was remote, if my status showed “away” for a few minutes, I’d get a message asking if I was at my desk. Some days I got 5–7 “just checking in” calls.

Micromanagement was off the charts. I’ve never seen anything like it—and I was the Director.

Total chaos disguised as structure.

Even a basic question like “Tell me about yourself” is a chance to show if you can organize your thinking. Rambling or overloading your answer breaks trust early.

---

## 2. Self-Awareness  
**Do you understand your own patterns, limits, and growth areas?**  
When they ask about strengths and weaknesses, they are not looking for perfection. They want to know if you're real, reflective, and coachable.

---

## 3. Decision-Making Process  
**Do you think clearly under pressure? Can you explain how you made a choice?**  
In questions about challenges or team conflict, they want to see how you prioritize, what tradeoffs you make, and what drives your logic.

---

## 4. Growth Mindset  
**Are you improving, learning, and adapting over time?**  
Questions like “What have you taught yourself recently?” or “What do you do when stuck?” reveal whether you plateau or level up.

---

## 5. Ownership Energy  
**Do you take responsibility or shift blame?**  
How you talk about failure, feedback, or team decisions shows whether you act like an owner or just follow along. Ownership always stands out.

You cannot fake this in a single night. But you can practice out loud.  
Your clarity, tone, and confidence grow when you hear yourself explain things.

"Even a basic question like “Tell me about yourself”

FYI - this basic question is probably the most important question. It allows for you to set the tone regarding what you want from a career (and so the incentive for you staying their long term), allows you to highlight any major milestones... and even immediately address any obvious elephants in the room e.g. a currently ongoing job gap.

And yes, it is a chance to showcase your ability to organise and proactively prepare for what would be the most predictable question. Getting tongue-tied over this would be like getting tongue-tied over your own name.

If a question as standard as this is something you're unable to be clear and concise on, that sends a negative message about your work approach overall.",comment_2,r/interviews,Professional,,https://www.reddit.com/r/interviews/comments/1ku4v9i/the_5_things_interviewers_are_actually_listening/

Do companies ask this because they have consistent problems with conflict within the team or is it to determine something else about you?

"They want to see how you would handle this. I helped with behavioral based interviews and the idea is how you handled this before is how you would handle it at the job you are interviewing for. We were looking for folks who would try to kindly handle this on their own first before seeking help from a supervisor. For example, if a coworker was not doing their job for a few days, maybe you could kindly ask if they are ok or need help with a question. Sometimes this works. Other times, the coworker may be rude to you and intentionally not other work and more work falls on you. This is when you could go to your supervisor and let them know about the coworker, how you offered help, and the outcome.

"If you are being interviewed, keep doing what you are doing You don’t have to play tricks on your resume. There are no “essential” phrases to say (or not say) during an interview. One small mistake will not cost you a job.

It’s a tough market right now, and out of the hundreds of resumes an employer receives, there may be a dozen applicants who are qualified for the job. But the company only has 1 job opening, so 17 other perfectly qualified candidates didn’t receive an offer. This wasn’t because of something wrong with their resumes or anything they said in the interview, but because the company **only had one job opening.**

Also, given the increased number of qualified candidates, the employer will interview more people. This means that more people will be rejected per job opening than usual.

So, if you don’t get an offer, don’t feel like you did anything wrong. Most people who interview don’t get an offer. Ha… sad story.

If you get an interview, your resume and qualifications are fine. Don’t be hard on them. Keep doing what you’ve been doing.

If you feel you must improve something, then improve your interview skills: if you’re not confident in expressing yourself, practice more with Beyz interview assistant and use the STAR method to tell your story. If you don't know where to start your self-introduction, please take a closer look at the JD and your resume, and pick out the relevant skills or project background to describe.

It also has a 90s prep training, and the interview coach can give you suggestions. Record yourself, design a countdown, observe your performance in the mirror and review each record.

Sometimes, among many qualified applicants, who will be hired in the end is almost random, so use your interview time to find ways to make yourself stand out.",post,r/interviews,Professional,171.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/interviews/comments/1ktw463/if_you_are_being_interviewed_keep_doing_what_you/

"Religious Aversion to Shaking Hands in Interviews Hi everyone.  I have an interesing situation that I'd like your advice on.

I am a male with my final round interview for a position next week.  It involves several days of panels during an on-site visit.  One of the panel members is a Muslim woman.

I understand that Muslim women often will not shake hands with unrelated men.  Any recommendations for protocol on how I handle this when I meet the panel without making anyone feel uncomfortable?  Shake everyone else's hand and then not offer my hand to the Muslim woman?   Don't shake hands unless they offer their hands?  Avoid the thing altogether?

With job postings these days going over 100s of applicants within 24h its really though to standout from the crowd.

So I think it really makes a difference in today's competitive market, especially for remote jobs where really anyone can apply.

"It’s half luck/timing and half networking. Unfortunately it’s a shit job market right now. Took me 7 months to find a product design role at a tech company, and I found it only due to working my network.

Recommendations:
- Even if you reached out to your network, do it again, with detailed titles of roles you want and the skills you have. People need a reminder every 3-4 months that you are looking.
- Post the same info on LinkedIn and it will get seen and shared.
- Reach out to old bosses if you are on good terms—this is how I got my last 3 jobs, either I reached out for referrals or they reached out to me because I was too-of-mind.
- Consider joining Slack groups specifically for engineers. They often post roles there and fast track people they know from the Slack groups, or they are happy to help make introductions.

"I have 3 years out of college and am in a similar boat. Friend how got a $45k salary bump, but didn't interview for the same position -- but for them it came down to soft skills. Their new company admitted they were desperate for people, and that they usually hired MBAs 7+ years experience for their role but they couldn't find anyone else and they got along really well inside the company. Sometimes its just a culture fit thing.

  
I will also admit I have been applying probably for a solid year now and been through 2 final rounds -- I am about to move home to save money and continue working. I still have my current job but it's getting pretty toxic for me. I personally feel so relieved to be going home because I think people really can ""smell"" this kind of stuff -frustration, they've been interviewing for a while, interview fatigue- on candidates during interviews. Obviously this is a terrible job market, for me going home only for a bit will be a reset and I can figure out what I want to do next and try and get control of a situation (applying for jobs) that feels uncontrollable.

Software engineers offer a lot of talent. It's just a bad situation right now.

"It’s actually wild how much we gotta do just to maybe get a job First, you gotta *prove your worth* by doing unpaid internships or “freelance projects” that no one asked for. Cuz how dare you apply without 2+ yrs experience for an entry-level job, right?

Then you better tailor that resume like it’s a wedding dress. One wrong bullet point and boom, ATS says bye. and don't forget the *“additional questions”* like, 300 words on why you’re passionate about a job that pays $42k and burns your soul.

Congrats, you made it to round 1. We’re only hiring 1 person btw. If you stutter or pause to think, you're clearly not confident enough ""auto-reject"". If your answers are too perfect? Y~~ou’re def using AI tools like Claude, ChatGPT Finalfound,~~ [Beyz](https://beyz.ai?ref=SMIHa_) ~~to prep~~. You rehearsed too hard. You’re fake. Rejected again.

Too quiet? No leadership potential.  
Too loud? Not a culture fit.  
Too normal? Not interesting.  
Too unique? Might disrupt the team.

Post on Reddit or TikTok? Red flag. Might “expose company secrets.”  
No online presence? Red flag. You don’t understand tech.  
Use AI to prep? You’re cheating.  
Don’t use AI? You're falling behind.

What’s the job? Oh just a “support role” with vague goals, no mentorship, 50 tabs open at once, and no updates if you don’t get it...

"Rejection Help I recently interviewed for a position I felt really qualified for -- had even worked with the team before as a recent client. At first I was told there were two roles open and that I would be considered for another as well. I think all interviews went pretty well. I even recorded them and made my best friend listen to them with me - she's pretty judgy and the worst interview I had she rated a 3.8 out of 5 lol. 

I made it to final rounds and then the recruiter had no feedback, said they wouldn't change a thing, the team if they had two roles open would have sent an offer and that there's a possibility of a new role being approved so the team asked for us to stay in touch. Has this happened to anyone before? I can't tell if this was just a really really soft let down or what my chances are of another opening up. 

It's a job at one of the big fin-tech. The experience would be perfect for what I need in my career right now and exactly what I want to do next. I am kind of running out of other companies to apply to. Has anyone kept up with a recruiter before? What should the cadence look like -- monthly? I am thinking of just sharing my recent accomplishments and letting the recruiter know I am still interested in other positions. 

For further context the team also started hiring for a VP -- I'm an analyst. I am presuming this might hold things up for a while. Any advice other than 'just move on' would be great!

It’s a soft let down imo. The recruiter is just trying to keep you around in case the #1 pick falls through. If it’s any consolation it may have nothing to do with your interview. Sometimes candidates have already been decided before interviews start. IE internal candidates.

"Did I make a mistake? So I went for an interview last week. I was really excited for this. This is how it unfolded -

1. applied on a job portal and got the first callback in less than 24hrs of application. 

2. basic questions asked during the telephonic round

3. I got a follow up mail saying I was shortlisted and they wanted me to come for the “final round” - without disclosing the salary and/or other policies. 

The interview went well, but turns out they wanted me to work on an assignment on the spot just to check if i can “work under pressure”. 

There was no indication of this previously. I don’t know what came over me, but I didn’t agree to do the assignment on the spot. Did i make a mistake?

"Final round interview went south how should I proceed Hey fellow Redditors wanted some advice regarding a recent job position that I was close on getting but went south the last moment. I had an interview for a Key account Manager role in the most famous Igaming company in my country.

First round went well the talent acquisition recruiter said am a good fit second round went also really well they called me and for 2 hours we talked about my current position and the case study the provided and what was my thought process behind every response , they told me they will respond after a week. I thought it was ok but they called me back 2 hours later to tell me that it went great and they want me to do a final interview with the commercial operation manager and the key account manager lead. 
Final interview I didnt focus on technicalities or my background I assumed we would go deeper into their needs and goals with the position what they want me to do in general so I kept it short didnt go into details. Mind youI asked twice about salary and they told me tell us a number and we will let you know. Well here we go final question was about salary and without a miss i went a bit higher than what I found acceptable for such position ( considering I am the risky choice since I dont have the experience , only 1 year as an account manager but I believe i have the skillset and mindset to take care of VIP Accounts) considering I would have room to negotiate and well basically its my job to upsell when I have the option

Two days later the usual automated message came to my inbox Thank you but…..

I thought they would negotiate the salary part so since we took all those steps I emailed the recruiter to see if this was the reason deal went south ( before the final interview they were talking to me as it was final that we would proceed) Can this be saved or I just lost a direct promotion with probably better salary but riskier environment just because I went too high?

"I applied for a job and the next day I was contacted by hiring manager and set up for an interview with the VP three days later.  During the interview I was informed that I was the first candidate to be interviewed and the company was slow to hire.  Heard that before so I said, ok, this is where things go south.  Was informed that I would hear back in a couple of weeks.  A couple of weeks went by and I decided to follow up and they informed me they needed two more weeks.  Well those two weeks passed and I was actually contacted for a final sit down and pay discussion.

While the silence from when I first interviewed to now was deafening, I am surprised that things turned out.  

All that to say is that interviewing nowadays has no pattern or rhyme or reason.  We just have to be patient and wait it out.

"Rule of thumb is to be honest and transparent.  It is common knowledge that the job market right now is extremely tough and that some people have been out of a job for 6 to 12 months.  Your gap shouldn’t raise any eyebrows.  If you took some time before looking for work, just say that.  

My rule of thumb is to bring you to the interview.  The interviewer is not just looking at your experience but also you as a person.  They want to make sure you will fit in perfectly into their company culture, which you should know going into this interview.  Research the company and know a few things about the CEO, mission/vision/values, if available. 

When provided the opportunity to ask questions, get the interviewer to talk about their experience.  I always ask, what is your favorite thing about working here? Or how would you describe the company culture? Or what has been the highlight of your time at this company?

In this round I was asked to do a small task which was kind of related to take home test, but I was using a 4.5 year old Mac and with a video call on, XCode became really slow. I still wrote without the xcode syntax check. But I took a lot of time to implement the solution and I could not put effort into the designing part. Though it was just 3 or 4 classes only. If I used my office mac, I would not have spent this much time to solve it as the task was relatively easy. Next day of course I got a rejection email. I was shattered so didn't respond to the mail till now.

"“Tell me about a time when” but I don’t have a worthwhile “time when” This question always trips me up. It’s not like I’ve never made a mistake or anything, but those stories are so boring. I worked in food service, so a “difficult customer” situation would just be:

1. I made the food wrong and they complained.

2. I remade the food and gave them a credit.

3. I didn’t do it again.

Like what’s even the point of saying that? A bad situation with a coworker would be:

1. This guy kept calling me sweetheart.

"It’s a good question! My true to myself answer is that I’m very deliberate about word choice in my  presentation content.

It’s something that’s important to me and I try to bring that standard along when I work with others.
***
I think the key to a good answer is not to pick something that’s necessarily a true negative or that is at least subjective and to provide a specific story/example to go with it. Some examples (without a story):
- It takes me a little longer to finish my code because I really triple check that it’s right.

"Unsure were my technical interview is? What to do? I have a technical interview on Monday at 10 a.m. at a company that starts business at 9 a.m. I did an online face-to-face interview with them via Teams before.  I asked the person on the phone if the interview would be at their business located in the suburbs, basically the other side of the city I live in. Their response was ""yeah, but all of the instructions are in the invite.""

  
The invite to the calendar does not mention any location because some of the people in the interview are from another state and will be dialling in to watch me, I assume.

When I view the calendar invite on my phone, there is a ""directions"" button, and when I click on it, Google Maps gives instructions on how to get to the Microsoft Corporate Sales Office building in my city, which is located in the central CBD.

  
I am a bit unsure where I need to go.

  
I was thinking of emailing the person who sent the invite to me, confirming the interview is at the Microsoft - Corporate Sales Office building in the CBD, but I am worried I might look stupid as the Calendar on my phone is showing me to go there. 

Another thing I was worried about is I don't know what floor or room I need to go to if it were in the  Microsoft - Corporate Sales Office building (a very large building), which makes me think perhaps it is not here but in their office in the suburbs?

"For me, I listened to YouTube videos of experts coaching the “correct” way to answer questions. There’s one person in particular whose advice I seek out first because I think his is better than others, but every time I post the name, people think I’m one of those advertising spam bots since they are taking over lol. There is a lot of good advice for these hard questions though, watch some videos on guidance and formulate standard answers.

My hardest question was always what is your greatest weakness until I learned the “correct” standard answer, and now I’m always confident going into this. The correct answer is to say something you haven’t done yet. For example, if you’re applying to a promotion position that will require you to do X that isn’t something you’ve done, that would be your weakness. They can’t use against you something you haven’t done, and you aren’t dodging the question either!",comment_3,r/interviews,Professional,,https://www.reddit.com/r/interviews/comments/1kti6yb/what_is_the_hardest_question_in_job_interviews/

"Thought an interview went super well… but idk what to do differently I had an interview this Wednesday and they said they would make a decision by today. I never got a call or email though so I guess I didn’t get it.

They started off by saying most of their interviews are really brief… and mine was only abt 15 minutes so maybe that’s really bad? During the interview, the interviewer barely asked me about my work experience. I’m only 21 but I have over a year of experience in the sales operation industry and I also go to a top university.

The interviewer started off by asking me to talk about myself so I did. I mentioned my year of internship experience in a relevant field, as well as my side hustle as a sneaker reseller… she asked me more about my sneaker business than my actual job 😭😭😭 and we got a bit side tracked and she did ask a fair amount of questions about it.

She also asked if I lived in the area, and I said yeah, and she said that it’s great since the job requires some in-office days. We chatted a bit about our common interest in music history, how we both think teamwork is really important in the workplace, and she asked about my hobbies as well. I told her I like to go try foods at new restaurants, and she made a comment about how I would “fit right in” since they have a team that likes to go restaurant hopping.

Towards the end, I mentioned that I knew someone who worked for the company (my friend who used to work with me… the interviewer knows her) and she laughed and told my friend I said hi. She was really excited and was laughing because my friend was sitting down the hall. 

But then she made a “joke” that she can’t hire me now since I know someone… she said she was joking but now idk. 

I guess I feel like she never even asked me about my work experience. I barely got to show her that I’m pretty experienced in the industry for my age. I tried to bring up my work throughout the interview and talk about how I’m actually a core member of my current internship’s supply chain and managing a lot of clients… but most of the interview was talking about my hobbies, side hustles, random stuff. 

I tried really hard to show that I’m hardworking at my current job. I said I hated being bored during work and like to see results… and she said something like “ah there’s lots to do here, you won’t be bored” 

Idk. I made her genuinely laugh and smile so it’s not like I’m a killjoy either. I feel like I have so much work experience in the industry. I’m doing a manager’s job at my current workplace and I feel like I wasn’t able to show my abilities at all during the interview. Idk how to approach these types of “behavioural” interviews going forward.

Any advice on what could have gone differently would be great! Thank you!",post,r/interviews,Professional,3.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/interviews/comments/1ktvfuc/thought_an_interview_went_super_well_but_idk_what/

"Toxic coworker that gets away with not doing his tasks, but when confronted gets you reported I work as a rollercoaster mechanic. We do daily inspections on the entire ride, every day and sign a checklist saying we checked a certain area. A coworker (that has been fired multiple times in the past from this same company) is like an old dog that doesn’t want to learn new tricks. He’s “knowledgeable” but argues when everyone doesn’t do it the way he says, but he’s also a hypocrite cus he doesn’t do any of the work at all. I legit watched him today stare at the chain from the bottom and not go up at all, pencil whipped the paperwork saying he did it. The other day he was complaining about another worker that wasn’t doing a task, and he reported him to the manager, while at the same time was not doing anything but complaining about the day and hasn’t moved an inch. He openly admitted to saying “well you inspected it yesterday so it has to be good, no point in checking it again” and uses that as an excuse to not do anything. I’ve been making major repairs by myself and even supervisors are seeing that he doesn’t help and either stands there and “guides”, or as he did the other day, went to go get breakfast and pick up a refrigerator for the shop, cus that is more important than helping me out. No repercussions for reporting him and even leadership isn’t taking action. Well today I decided to take it easy for a bit since I’m doing all of the work, and manager drove by and cussed me out for not moving fast enough and why aren’t I working. The one time I take it easy I getting a write up and this guys been doing it for months and nothing is getting done.

"I don’t want to be the “reliable employee” anymore i’ll get to the point very quickly here — my job is severely understaffed. i work as a cashier with only two other cashiers but they never schedule anyone on the same day as me, even when i work a double, so i’m always up front, by myself even when there’s a shitload of customers. i could call a manager for help but by the time they get up there i’ve already cleared out the line. they also expect me to clear the go-back rack, clean the fitting room occasionally, and open the boxes in the front and put out merchandise, all while being the ONLY cashier. i usually only get 2-3 days off which end up becoming 1 because they’re calling me in due to another person calling out. i’ve never had any issue telling people no but when it comes to work i almost always say yes. truthfully, i’m just thinking about the extra money i’m going to make but even that can’t motivate me these days. i just feel like saying yes makes things easier and less awkward in the long run. sometimes my boss will make a snarky comment and i know he’s being playful but at the same time i can tell he’s letting me know he was upset i didn’t come in. i’ve just stopped answering the phone as a whole but that doesn’t stop them from texting. i still won’t respond idc like i’m just at that point. i’m being overworked and they don’t even care. my other manager (that i truly can’t stand) came over to me just last week, while i was with a customer, and whispers in my ear to say “___ called out just now. you gotta run a double today.” EXCUSE ME?? like you’re TELLING me? not even asking, seeing if i’m available, so i turned and told her “no. i’m not running a double today i have to be somewhere after work.” she then had the nerve to question what i was doing and i told her it didn’t matter, i just can’t run a double so they’ll have to call in someone else. i don’t understand why managers get riled up about that anyway. if i’m scheduled 4 days out of 7, of course the 3 days i’m off i’m going to make plans, so NO i’m not gonna be sitting by the phone waiting on a possible call for me to go into work. it’s just become so frustrating for me honestly and i’m trying to ease my way out of reliability. my other co-workers get so much leniency when they’re late or call out simply because “that’s what’s expected of them” yet my job won’t fire them. it’s all so stupid and unfair. i won’t go to work and bullshit because i don’t want to get fired but there are some days where i just don’t do as much as i could and then on my days off, like i said, i’ve just stopped answering the phone.

"First things first: I’m Salinan Indian. The ‘hunter-gatherer’ phase of my ancestors weren’t all that far off.

And absolutely fuck that noise; I prefer getting my meat from the grocery store rather than spending the day, naked in the hot beating sun, trying to track down a deer only to fail and to come home to some acorn mush that was ground by my wife in back-breaking labor.

The bands of my tribe were small; under Dunbar’s Number for humans, and could better be thought of as a band of ‘extended family’ rather than some sort of formal organization. So… think of going to grandma’s when she invited all of her children and all your cousins—including the obnoxious one who did ‘wet willies’ in your ears while the adults weren’t looking. The leader of the band was often the most well-respected elder in the group—but not because he was calm and wise, but also because he could physically wipe the floor with someone who got out of line. And for those who didn’t pull their weight, there was exile—which usually lead to a slow starvation and eventual death.

We, the ones who live in this modern world, idealize the past when our relatives woke with the sun to spend the day foraging for food or working in bands to bring down animals for their food and skins—because it sounds simpler. Fewer decisions to make. (And decision making leads to cognitive effort and cognitive stress.) Your place is ‘known’ in the world.

But it was a stressful life: not knowing if you’ll even have anything to eat tomorrow, constantly racing the clock to gather enough food to survive the winter. There’s a reason why my parent’s and grandparent’s generation are all under 5 feet tall: lack of protein in their diets. And they were the ones who were born in the 1920’s through 1950’s—so they only had poverty to blame for their lack of protein. Their parent’s generation were described by Smithsonian researchers in the late 1800’s/early 1900’s as “petite.” 

Lack of nutrition does interesting things to how you physically develop.

When the Spaniards arrived and started building the California Missionaries and arrived with clothing from Europe—my own ancestors took to it in droves. Not because they longed to learn about Christ (as the Spaniards wrote), but because they loved the new building techniques (fired clay makes a better roofing material than woven plant matter and mud), and they loved the new clothing styles. (My tribe was naked, except for deer skins to keep warm in the winter, and woven shoes to protect their feet. Not because they were nudists—but because they were **poor**: they simply lacked the resources or materials to make anything that covered them. And let’s be honest, once you hit your 30’s after being sun-beaten your entire life, you’re not going to be a pretty sight naked. Clothing hides all sorts of sins.)

So how do I cope?

I’m sad I have to work, and it’s frustrating to deal with people at work. But I’m thankful I’m not naked in the weeds with angry relatives because they blame me for being upwind of the dinner who got away. And I’m thankful that the most frustrating thing I have to deal with is if someone fucked up the build in GitHub—and I don’t have to worry about starvation over the winter because the acorns kept in storage got rotten because a squirrel broke the woven mats that were supposed to keep the acorns dry.",comment_1,r/work,Professional,,https://www.reddit.com/r/work/comments/1ku6m4c/its_insane_we_leave_our_protected_home_for_a/

"New supervisor embarrassing me in emails Started a new job two months ago and I think considering I had no training, I’ve been doing really well. I was just given step by step documents to follow that don’t include any troubleshooting and have only made minor mistakes. My manager is really happy with me and never fails to give me praise.

However, my supervisor who helps me when I’m stuck or explains how to do tasks always embarrasses me in emails. I sent out an email yesterday based on the notes she gave me. So I was working with what I thought was right. The recipient of the email then responded and was querying why there was an issue as they were under a different impression. 

Anyway she was meant to be on vacation but she replied all and at’ed me saying I didn’t search for a particular term that’s why there was confusion and I should always do that in future. Meanwhile, nowhere was this ever mentioned and I’ve always done it how she said to do in the notes.

This isn’t the first time she’s done this and it feels like she’s undermining me. I’m meant to work with these people and it’s like she’s trying to make me look dumb especially being new. How can they trust me to do work for them?

I was really upset and sent her a professional email calling her out on it. I’m a bit anxious as to how she’ll respond. I plan on resigning in the next few months but have to stay in the role until then so just feel really discouraged.

"Advice on how to handle a situation gently. Sorry in advance for how lengthy this is.

I recently returned to work from a three month medical leave. 

When I went on leave I hadn't been at my job for a year yet and was still learning the ropes.

My brain works much differently than most people's. I always say if you put me in a room with 100 people and ask them to interpret a sentence 99 of them would say the same thing and I would interpret it in a completely different way.

As a result of this, I take tons of notes and I usually have alot of questions. Many times the questions I ask are to clarify that I am understanding what someone is saying by repeating what I think they meant in a way that makes sense to me. For example, I'll say something like, ""OK, just so I understand, if this says ""X"" then that means I would do ""Y""? And then when the person confirms my understanding I will write down a note as quickly as I can in my own language so I will know what to do without asking again. I will also immediately type up my handwritten notes into guides in my own language and while the information is still fresh in my head so I am sure to include everything I was told.

Now that I've returned to work, I am finding that much of my on the job knowledge has been lost and in many ways it feels like I am starting over from square one. 

The one woman who was training me was great. I explained to her that I needed to take lots of notes.  She always paused when I needed to do notes, went over things slowly and completely and always allowed me to ask questions even if it was after we had met. She is highly intelligent and highly competent. 

The other woman is also highly intelligent and competent. However I had trouble learning from her. She would go over things very quickly because everything was second nature to her. She also tended to leave out steps not on purpose but again it was just second nature and I think her mind just assumed I would intrinsically understand how to do the step she didn't tell me. For example she would show me how to access a piece of information from our software system. It's a complex system. She would start at the main screen then quickly click through all the menus and drop downs and pop up screens while I furiously tried to watch, listen and write down the steps properly. 

Many times after trying to follow the directions myself I would hit a knowledge wall and would have to keep going back to her for more directions. It was clear after a while that she found it annoying and had a low opinion of my competence.

Additionally she felt that once she showed me how to do something that she expected me to be able to do it from then on without problems or questions. Even if it was something she showed me but I didn't do again until weeks later. She would be irritated with me and would say things like, you've done this before or I've already trained you on this. I tried many times to explain to her that I needed to take notes, apologized because I know it's annoying and then explain that I was following the notes I took but it looked like I didn't have anything that explained a specific step. I  would explain that I'm just trying to fill in the gaps in my notes so I didn't have to bother them.

My job has a lot of grey areas too that I would seek advice on how to handle correctly. 

Upon returning, the woman who was good at training me has gone on maternity leave. Now I being retrained by the other woman. I have come to the conclusion that I was poorly trained initially by the one woman and have lots of knowledge gaps. 

Now, when she is showing me how to do something, I am being much more vocal about asking questions, clarifying what she said, asking her to wait a moment while I finish writing things down and stopping her when she's going through screens or something quickly and saying could you please go back I didn't see how you did that. 

It is very clear she is irritated by this. I get the impression that she thinks I shouldn't need retraining, that I ask too many questions and that I'm stupid and incompetent. 

I am also worried that she has made her opinion of me clear to another coworker. This Friday she gave me something to work on and quickly explained it. I tried writing down what she was saying but she said, don't worry I'll send you an email explaining what to do. I asked when she needed it done by because she never communicates that to me and she said the end of the day. She sent me the email but what she wrote made absolute zero sense to me. I re-read it ten times trying desperately to understand what she wanted because I didn't want to bother her with questions. It filled me with dread.

I finally had to reply to her email and say, ""I'm sorry, I just have a few questions about what you wrote."" Then I copied the phrases that were absolutely nonsensical to me and then would say either, I'm not sure what your asking here or I think you want me to do this is that correct? 

I didn't hear back from her so after a half hour I sent a Teams message and said Hey, just letting you know I sent you a reply about the project, I don't want it to get lost in your email. I can't start working on this until I know what you want. 

At 2pm she finally came by my desk. She still hadn't replied to my email. I asked her about it and told her I hadn't started the project because I needed clarification and I was worried because she wanted it done by the end of the day and it was already late. She was clearly pissed at me. She asked me what my questions were and I opened my email and got the information I needed. 

I then heard her go over to my other coworker say something to her,  then groan in frustration as the other woman giggled. I felt humiliated. 

I don't know how to navigate this. I actually really like her, I have a lot of respect for how good she is at this job. I do not want to go to my manager (who is awesome) and essentially ""throw her under the bus"" by saying she doesn't train me well. I also don't want it to seem like I'm one of those employees who thinks everything they do incorrectly is someone else's fault. I always assume I am always in the wrong, own up to any mistakes I make immediately and apologize and always thank her for helping me. 

I love what I do. I love the company I work for. I love my manager. I love my coworkers including the woman who is currently training me. It is very important to me that I do a good job.

How do I navigate this without blowing up the situation and causing resentment but at the same time advocate for myself to get what I need to understand my duties properly?

"Can you get an AI notetaker app to help you take notes? Has someone already created written instructions for what you need to do? 

It sounds like email isn't working. Do not wait for your trainer to check in on you. Let your trainer know that you want to do a good job and appreciate her help. Ask if she will give you 5 minutes in person each morning to ask questions. Let her know that while she may have already explained it, you want to ensure you do it to her standards. Is there someone else who does your job who can mentor you?

Please do not spend time explaining that you may interpret things differently from others. This has an ""I need special treatment"" quality about it. Instead, say, ""I may need to go over this a couple of times to get it right, so that I may come to you for clarification.""

Don't pay attention to people rolling their eyes or making snide comments. Also, assuming you are wrong is not helping you. Apologizing and explaining yourself will not get you anywhere in the workplace.

"> clearly talking about me

Were they? Because this is one of the things I hate most about team meetings or having to relay information to my team all at once.

Someone *always* assumes one bit of info regarding a rule or a policy is directed at them when it isn't. And I tell them every time, a meeting or a group chat is not going to be the first time you're being warned about something. If there's a problem, I'm going to discuss it privately with you.

What usually happens is HR or another department info dumps on me and it's my job to relay it to everyone.

One of the reasons that managers re-state the attendance policy after an event, is to reinforce to THE OTHER WORKERS what the policy is.

"Couldn't have gone worse Like many people out there I work in a cubicle farm that has been largely remote since Covid. 

A while ago they started having us come in two days per week. No problem, but then the immediate question was if it would increase? The answer was not in the near future. 

As happens frequently in an office environment a rumor had started that we were going to start coming in full time starting in the summer. 

In an attempt to quell the uprising our manager called a quick meeting to address the rumor. Did he keep it simple and tell us that there were currently no plans to increase in office days? 

No. That would have been far too easy. 

Instead he went on for 15 minutes about how we will eventually be coming back into the office, but he didn't know when or how many days it would be.

"Need Advice Hi, I am new to this sub and am hoping for some advice. I took early retirement from a corporate job a few years ago but just recently started working part-time. The company is a local mom-and-pop type place. The “mom” is my boss and has a few side hustles in addition to the business. I was hired to work in the office for the actual business that they own. The owners have been on vacation and I noticed while they were gone my paychecks were incorrect (I was overpaid).

The owners will be back next week and I will be giving my two weeks notice. My question is how to handle this extra money? Obviously, I don’t want it, but I know I have to report it on my taxes. Do I just repay it to the owner in cash or ask them to take it out of my last paycheck?

"customer uses our store as a shipping address for her online order… EDIT: so there is a plot twist. I didn’t work yesterday, but apparently our POS system rolled out with a new update that allowed us to do SPECIAL ORDERS: ship to store, pick up in store, or ship to home. after seeing this email, I called another store to ask for advice. manager suggested checking it into our receiving program and that did not work so apparently it IS a situation where a customer ordered online and had it shipped to our store. customers can not do special orders themselves, they have to go into a store to do it apparently. and with the pos system updating yesterday while we received the package yesterday; it’s quite impossible that she went to another store and did a special order considering our system won’t even let us process it. idk what to do now.




probably used the wrong flair but idek what to use for this. we don’t do special orders. we never have. i didn’t work yesterday, our new employee did so  he probably just accepted the package from the delivery people since we normally get small packages from vendors. but this is a customers package, it had her information on it, coupons inside of it.. we are a pretty small shop (i recognize the name) and it’s one of the customers i’ve told that we don’t do special orders. it’s lowkey kind of frustrating and i don’t have any way to contact her.

"Is it a good idea to Cold Email the CEO of the fairly large company I work at just to introduce myself? I work at a fairly large Global Insurance company. I work for a subsidiary (20-35 employees) of a subsidiary that is owned by the parent company (Think 1500-4000 employees). I was hired a little over 6 months ago and while not at the bottom of the totem pole, I am fairly close to it. 

I really enjoy this company, the work, and would love to be able to stay here and move up through the ranks. I am cordial with the CEO of our subsidiary but unfamiliar and no connection with the heads of the larger subsidiary or parent company. 

My question is, would it be in bad taste to send them a cold email to introduce myself and glad to be working at the company, ect?I know they are extremely busy and I am completely irrelavent to them

Or do large CEO like those kind of emails? Part of me feels like it would be a good look and possibly help me in the future. But another part is I mostly feel like they would look down on an email like that and potentially tell my manager and cause issues.

"Denied sick pay I can't find any sources on the rest of the web, so I figured I'd come here. I'll explain the situation I recently had. I live in California by the way.

I work a consistent Sun-Thursday schedule. I'm almost never scheduled on Friday or Saturday unless I'm truly needed. I called out sick on Sunday, my new manager asks me if I can come in on the upcoming Saturday instead. I said yes (reluctantly, was trying to make a good impression of my work ethic to my new manager). I work the Saturday, and the rest of my regular days, Sun-Thursday. Six days in a row. My manager calls me a week later on my day off, she says she's doing payroll. And says ""since you called out Sunday but picked up an extra day on Saturday, I'm going to veto your sick day pay because then we'd have to pay you overtime. Because on payroll, you technically worked 48 hours that week."" I don't remember the rest of the conversation cuz I was furious, I was almost certain that's against the law. Can someone please tell me if she's allowed to do that? I worked 6 days in a row as well, I was insanely tired that week but that's besides the point. But anyway, please tell me if she can do that.

The norm is if you make up your missed day during the same pay period you don’t use that PTO or sick day, You get to keep it to use in the future.

"Has anyone else had a coworker that you feel might physically hurt you? 
So there’s this woman I work with, we used to get kinda along even tho she always was bossy and rude in the way she said things, when she doesn’t like you she talks shit about you to the whole store, even got our old manager fired.

 Anyways, recently I have started to stand up for myself, for example (we are dog groomers even tho she works front desk and I mainly do haircuts) there was this really difficult, aggressive old dog that didn’t want to stand up and I needed help to trim his belly, I asked her to help me since I couldn’t hold him and do the haircut at the same time by myself since he’s heavy, she said she didn’t get paid enough to break her back to which I replied “me either” she literally exploded at me, called me rude and that I should just quit, then stormed off the room slamming the door.

Episodes like this have been increasing, me asking for help or asking a question, or the boss telling her to help with something, she will just yell at me, use vulgar language, I told my boss every single one of those interactions.

Yesterday tho it was different, she again yelled at me, I called my boss, same as usual, difference is the boss comes to the store, ask to talk to us both and when the crazy lady didn’t let me talk she AGAIN stormed out of the room, boss talked to her and didnt tell me what did they say, after that she was showing more aggressive body language and using hostile language and tbh the look on her face every time she talked to me was scary, at some point she even just started crying a lot telling other coworker how much i stress her and then lock herself in the restroom, like???

Document the day and time the outburst happened. I’ve dealt with some bad co workers in my early career of generally working and there were days I thought I was going to walk out but nope. You need to stand your ground. The reason I bring up documentation is to cover your ass. People like this generally turn on you and sometimes make up stories to try and get you fired. Now if you document and bring this to your manager and the manager doesn’t do anything, you need to find a new job. Honestly if I were in your position, I would already be job hunting right now for my own sanity. Sometimes people like this are very manipulative and the boss\manager can side with them and make you look like the bad guy. However, a good manager can always tell based on the situation who is who. Once again, document these outbursts. What, when, and who in these documentations and also take note of what cameras are in place where the outburst took place.

"I’m having a hard time fitting in with the team at my first job I’m 18 and recently started working as a waitress — it’s my first job ever. I work at a small restaurant. Most of the staff there are younger girls, around 15–17, still in school. There’s one girl who’s 16, and for some reason, she disliked me from the start. She’s constantly criticizing me, yelling at me, telling me I’m doing everything wrong.

Today, I heard her say to a new guy, “Everything going okay? Let me know if you need anything.” I’ve never heard her speak to me like that. And later today she was yelling at me for sitting down for a quick rest — saying there’s too much to do — but a minute later I saw her sitting in the back with that same new guy, on her phone, vaping.

All of this would be fine if it weren’t for the fact that I have to listen to her. She’s been working there for a year and kind of has “seniority,” so people treat her like she’s in charge. Overall, I don’t really enjoy working with this team. It feels like everyone is best friends with each other, and I’m just the odd one out.

The only people I actually feel comfortable with are the bartender and one other waitress — they’re both around 22. Honestly, I think I’m just really different from most of the people working there. It’s mostly high school girls who swear all the time, go out drinking every night, skip school — that sort of vibe. I’ve never been like that. I graduated with honors, I barely drink, don’t smoke, and I actually enjoy being home.

Lately, I’ve been thinking about quitting. Spending 12-hour shifts with people I have nothing in common with is exhausting.

"Manager called me selfish and said she knows me better than I do So I've been struggling lately with health issues that have left me and doctors perplexed. 
Sometimes, I will feel faint and lightheaded and I need to sit down and eat. Othertimes I will just feel shakey and get super weak and will need to sit. Today it was especially worse where I really felt I was going to fall to the floor. I felt a little nauseous but I think I just really needed to sleep (hoping that's all that it is is just more sleep or something).

I was at work when this happened and I tried to push through the initial ill feelings, but the longer I went the worse I felt until I told my manager I felt really sick and needed to go home. She was annoyed and outted me saying that this isn't the first time this has happened, referencing last week one day where I felt so lightheaded I made myself some food and went to go eat, telling my coworker and her that I needed to sit and eat cause I was feeling like I was gonna pass out (we work at a bakery/restaurant). That day she came to me saying it was not fair that I was sitting and eating and my coworker and her were in the back working (like okay I'm just gonna go fall then and then you will yell at me for not sitting or something). I told her i needed to sit and eat cause i was feeling lightheaded, and asked her what else was I supposed to do (she said idk ...? Like???)
Today she was annoyed that I felt like that again (probably worse). I even had a regular get me a couple of sodas from next door. My boss called me unreliable and told me that I had to work the whole day cause it wasn't fair to her that I was doing this (cause apparently I'm doing it on purpose). So I tried to push through again, but my body said no as I thought about what would happen if I didn't just go home (probably would have fallen asleep at one of the tables or something). So I rushed over to her and told her I'm going home and if she wants to fire me that's fine cause I understand me feeling ill lately has not been very convenient and that yea it isn't fair to her or to me for this to happen. She got frustrated again, told me to call my mom to get me instead of driving when I felt like this (she was right and now my car is at the work parking lot) and proceeded to call me selfish because I wasn't thinking about her or her business or my family and how they felt about me being sick. She then proceeded to say she knew me better than I knew myself saying I can't work more than 4 hours without needing to sit down (I'm on my feet all day and work 8 hour shifts. Am I just supposed to not eat, not sit down, not take a break?) she said I can't work more than 40 hours a week which she's not wrong about (since I got sick I haven't been able to really work as much as I used to, but I've been trying.) I explained to her that I am not selfish and that I can't control when I'm gonna feel like this. I told her I don't know what's going on with my lately, that I've been to the doctors and we're trying to figure it out, and she said it's all in my head and that I look fine. Sure I look fine, but it's kinda dumb to assume nothing is wrong just based on that. Anyways, she kept going off on me as I tossed aside her remarks and she said if I couldn't work the whole day today I should have let them know the day before. But like I said, how can I predict when I'm gonna feel like this? Guess what? I can't. And it's annoying. And it's even more annoying and frustrating and downright rude to assume that nothing is wrong with me. CLEARLY something is wrong. And something is wrong with my boss for treating me like that. I'm done and I'm hoping she either fires me or I quit when I go to pick up my car.
Just know readers not only do I deserve better but you as well deserve better if you are ever in a similar situation or have found yourself in a similar situation. Borderline crazy to think it's okay to talk to one of the employees like that.

Update: I don't have the luxury to not work unfortunately. I'm grateful she took me in. The past few weeks I've felt these symptoms. My bloodwork is fine. I just need to do my best.

- she is constantly whispering to different people, gossiping and talking bad about every single person, then doing it to the next, etc
- she is SUPER sensitive, if she gets snappy with me and I snap just a little back, she will run to my uncle (one of my bosses) and say how I mistreat her
- she is alwayssss telling one other employee how I don’t do a good job, and I can hear it from my office. Last time she did this, I went in her office and asked what I was doing wrong so it could be corrected- she had nothing to say
- she makes a lot of mistakes in her job duties (banking) not on purpose, but she never takes accountability 
- she told my uncle I need to go back to school to get more education, meanwhile I have a college degree and she barely went to high school I believe

"My job is negatively impacting my mental health. Is the market really that bad? TW: Suicidality/self harm

Long story short I was an actor living and working in NYC pre-lockdown. I worked as a teaching artist for several years, performed off broadway and did a bunch of regional gigs post-grad.

My parents made me go back to school during lockdown (I was visiting them in March and ended up stranded there for about 6 months bc my roommate was a diabetic and immunocompromised). I  kinda just picked any degree program that was affordable to get them off my back. In any other world I'd have gone into education, but you can only get certified in the state you attend university in so it didn't make sense at that time.

When I finally got the degree the entertainment industry was still pretty dead so I got a job with the degree I just got. That job sucked I hopped ship to a better opportunity.

The role they sold to me was supposed to be creative and to be honest it's just not. It's mostly data entry, I found out recently my hiring was contentious and a result of my supervisor not handling his workload. I was supposed to do social media but my supervisor never released the reins, his supervisor put his foot down and without talking to me they've hired someone to handle that separately. So now I have like no creative tasks and I'm going insane.

It's also fully in person and is still significantly less money than what everyone has said I should be making for this role. I also found out recently that my hiring was contentious and only happened because my supervisor was fucking up constantly. 

This was supposed to be a stepping stone but with all of the recent economic rollbacks/recession shit I've been here for about 8 months longer than I'd planned to be.

Welp I'm suicidal at work now. Like all the time. My self harm tendencies from high school are back and honestly I'm really resentful of my parents who yanked me off a path I'd been on for 20 years.

I didn't actually ever want this career track and hadn't planned to stay on it for long I'd planned to pivot into something with more creative/short form tasks (I have ADHD so this stuff is more compatible with my disability)  but I'm scared to leave now because of how bad the market is. I just feel no fulfillment and then I don't have time to work on any of my other pursuits that actually give me joy. I'm 30 now about to get married, want to have a family and I'm terrified that I'm at a tipping point where these will be the types of roles I have for the rest of my life. Like if this is how I feel now, what's going to happen when I spend all day doing this job I hate and then go home and also have to take care of a child. And I'm just lost and I don't know what my future looks like before even considering the AI of it all.

Everyone around me keeps insisting that careers are long and this could turn into something I enjoy/develops into something I enjoy but I'm genuinely concerned if I stay in roles like this I will eventually kill myself.

So like is the market so bad I should just stay put and hold onto my butt or what do you even do? I'm having an existential crisis.",post,r/work,Professional,7.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/work/comments/1ktlw9s/my_job_is_negatively_impacting_my_mental_health/

"Miserable at work, don’t know whether to quit I’ve been working in a shop for the last 2-1/2 years, and at first I really enjoyed it. Then last year I got passed over for a promotion to keyholder, and this year I finally got the promotion only to be told I wouldn’t be getting a raise. Since then my morale has plummeted, not helped by the fact that two coworkers who have been here shorter than me have both gotten promotions and earned appropriate raises as well. 
I am prone to depressive episodes, but I’ve been adequately medicated the last year or so. Even so, every day feels like a struggle as my mood begins to drop the second I clock in. By lunchtime I’m effectively brain dead and huddled in the back room avoiding everyone and sulking. I don’t feel like my boss respects me and I am growing paranoid that my failing job performance will result in me being fired. I want to take time off but can’t do that without placing a lot of strain on my coworkers.
Mostly I just want to quit. It’s almost all I can think about.

"How to deal with being handed tasks that's beyond a junior role? I’m working in a non office setting, and I’ve noticed a recurring issue that I’m not quite sure how to approach professionally. Certain tasks—typically handled by senior staff or team leads—are being passed down to junior employees like myself. In my experience, these tasks were part of a more senior-level scope. 

Unfortunately, HR didn't conduct proper onboarding nor provide clear breakdown of what tasks fall under Junior, Senior, or Manager-level roles. I’ve held lead and senior roles before on other companies, so I’m fairly familiar with what typically falls within their responsibilities.

I’m hesitant to bring it up directly with the managers, since they’re also among the staff handing over tasks to juniors. I don’t want to create conflict or come across as unwilling to help, but I also don’t want to keep taking on tasks that don’t match my scope—especially when there’s no or added compensation.

I'm thinking of asking HR what tasks are expected at each level? And once these are clear, should I just tell them the situation outright?

"For the most part they are used synonymously. Laid off is the only one I would say is a bit different. Fired/let go/dismissed would be you were just removed from your job. You were fired and your business has no plans to hire you back. Laid off usually refers to being removed from the job, but the employer didn't necessarily want to do it.

For example during Covid, a lot of people were temporarily laid off, with the understanding that as soon as the business was able to, they would bring those people back to work. I've also seen businesses have to lay people off due to not having the budget anymore, and once the business is able to afford those people again they are able to go back to their job if they choose, instead of the business having to hire all new people.",comment_1,r/work,Professional,,https://www.reddit.com/r/work/comments/1ktlxch/question_from_eu_to_us_fired_let_go_laid_off/
"Yeah, they're all synonyms. Occasionally there's a slightly different process - i.e.:

-""laid off"": usually means that there was something else going on, for example the company made a lot of people redundant at the same time or closed down a branch/team or something. The outcome is the same (fired/no longer working there) but the process is a little different ",comment_2,r/work,Professional,,https://www.reddit.com/r/work/comments/1ktlxch/question_from_eu_to_us_fired_let_go_laid_off/

"Agree. ""Let go"" feels like it could go either way, ""dismissed"" or ""fired"" imply there was a reason having to do with you, and ""laid off"" or ""downsized"" are about restructuring or budget realities (temporary or otherwise).",comment_4,r/work,Professional,,https://www.reddit.com/r/work/comments/1ktlxch/question_from_eu_to_us_fired_let_go_laid_off/
"Marked 'no' on ""Are accommodations for disabilities required?"" because my manager was standing next to me and said she will do any reasonable accommodation necessary for my medical condition. Accommodations were proceeded to not be given but I was punished for needing them instead... I have a severe immunological disease/bone/muscle/joint disorder (I even have joints replaced) that requires me to sit more than stand. Especially on hard, non-padded flooring. I was told this was 100% ok as my new job really does not require standing other than for... optics? I guess? Thanks America.

Anyway... My boss' boss then decided this is NOT okay and even removed me from my shift over it, all in front of other coworkers. It was humiliating. I ended up crying over it (I NEVER actually cry. Just a bad time the past month - first pregnancy & miscarriage, hospital stays, surgeries and those weren't even for the miscarriage, insomnia, coughing up blood, and I barely hit my 30s.... yeehaw).

My doctor will be writing me a note to get them to comply with the ADA today. Considering letting him be snarky in it the way he wants to be. Thoughts?",post,r/work,Professional,3.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/work/comments/1ktihgt/marked_no_on_are_accommodations_for_disabilities/
"Just a heads up, your doctor cannot make your employer comply with the ADA. Recommended accommodations are recommendations only and the employer can argue that they aren't reasonable and therefore not accommodate you. I'd really think long and hard about being ""snarky"" or having your doctor be ""snarky"".",comment_1,r/work,Professional,,https://www.reddit.com/r/work/comments/1ktihgt/marked_no_on_are_accommodations_for_disabilities/
"So, the form asked if accommodations were needed.
You obviously needed accommodations so..... why on earth would you answer ""no"" to that question??

Effectively you told your company that you don't need accommodations and now you're crying because they won't give you the thing you didn't ask for.

You could have avoided all of this by answering the question honestly. Your manager would then have been able to say to the higher-ups that you need accommodations & would have been able to help you.",comment_2,r/work,Professional,,https://www.reddit.com/r/work/comments/1ktihgt/marked_no_on_are_accommodations_for_disabilities/
"I’m confused why you lied about needing accommodations when asked? I also don’t understand the need for being snarky, nor do I think it’ll be helpful.",comment_3,r/work,Professional,,https://www.reddit.com/r/work/comments/1ktihgt/marked_no_on_are_accommodations_for_disabilities/
"First of all, you were NOT ""punished"" for needing it - your boss' boss did what they had to do to shield the employer from potential lawsuit.  The fact that they had to take that action is NOT their fault - they are legally required to make accommodations and those were the accommodations they could make immediately.  This is YOUR FAULT, for not being HONEST on your application, which would have given them the heads-up that they would need to set up your work area a little differently.  Instead, you LIED, and then put them on the spot when you showed up for work, and now want to play the victim.  Grow up.",comment_4,r/work,Professional,,https://www.reddit.com/r/work/comments/1ktihgt/marked_no_on_are_accommodations_for_disabilities/
"I'm confused too.  You need accommodations, but marked the form that you didn't need them.  Now it's an issue because your boss's boss has no documented reason for you to be sitting during your shift or whatever it is that you needed.  You should definitely straighten this out, but no one should be snarky here.  This sounds like an issue that could have been easily avoided with some honesty up front.",comment_5,r/work,Professional,,https://www.reddit.com/r/work/comments/1ktihgt/marked_no_on_are_accommodations_for_disabilities/
"Daily/Job Reports: Necessary Evil, Valuable Tool, or Just a Time Sink? What's Your Take? Most frontline jobs involve some kind of daily, end-of-shift, or end-of-job reporting (logging tasks, hours, issues, and whatever). From your experience, how valuable is this information actually used by the company versus how much of a burden is it for you to complete?

Do you see a clear benefit, or does it often feel like paperwork for paperwork's sake?",post,r/work,Professional,2.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/work/comments/1ktl7ns/dailyjob_reports_necessary_evil_valuable_tool_or/

"Handling a bully at work Guys, I need advice. 

I work in a group of give or take 50 people, goverment job, almost all university educated (it's important detail, bear with me). Exactly 3 people in the office have lower education.
Among them a female coworker in her fifties. That woman is rude as f***. She handles paperwork, filing, sorting...basically we need her to open, find, sort files for us, that we can do our job. Kind of a secretary,  but not really. We can't start part of our work without her opening it for us is important here. She also handles restocking, ordering stuff we need...all-rounder kind of.

When I first started there I thought it's just her asserting seniority (I know...insecure people 🙄), but after 2 years there and getting to know the office dynamic more,  she is still extremely rude to newcomers,  younger people and mostly those 2 coworkers with same lower education like hers. I heard from others that she wanted the same job as most of us have there - its strictly specific education related, but couldn't finnish the university. With most of others she makes constant sarcastic rude remarks (always work-related) trying to make them look incompetent. She is often literally screaming at those 2 coworkers with lower education, telling other coworkers how incompetent they are, rather than explaining how to do some specific things, making people unnecessary wait for her to open files, vocalising her opinion on coworkers, belitteling people...God forbid anyone has to ask her something. Basically she is the best, others are shi*. She doesn't pull that behaviour with the boss and some senior coworkers, but they all see her doing it to others and let it slide, so complaining to the boss is a no-go.

When I asked why they let it slide I always get the same answer - it's just how she is. Except it's not, she is normal to senior coworkers and extremely nice to customers.

So, my problem is, how to handle her? I'm a really nice person, often mistaken for week, but I do stand up for myself. I tried normal, i tried really nice with her, i tried making her my friend, i tried rude, i tried ignoring her and than beeing nice if she is doing well...all went really bad and ended with her picking on me more. Last time we had a clash and now we are kind of ignoring eachother. Which would be totally fine with me but is affecting my work, since I do need her to do her job to be able to do part of mine.  

I started writing down all the stuff she pulls to send it to HR if necessary. Coworker tried publicly proving her wrong,  but honestly I'm not witty and good in debating in heated situations. And can't really prepare since its always something else beeing a problem. 

People in HR, psychologist, fellow office bullies, people who foughtoff the bully....I need advice. She is making me hate the office and I generally love my job, I really dont want to find a job elsewhere.

Make sure you have enough STRONG evidence whenever you contact HR. Make recordings of their behavior if you have to. Because reporting to HR is a risk - they protect the company foremost.

"Currently in the same boat, different situation, only been there for half a year, but everyone I know at work is nice to me, I'm nice to them (even the ones I know I would ignore outside of work) but one senior co-worker who licks the bosses ass voluntarily, consistently criticizes me like I'm a clueless child. Luckily she alone has no power to decide my future with the company as the work boss asked me to do because senior couldn't do it anymore, is only a small part of my job.

She's trying to push me to the edge of spontaneous combustion but I have to stay chill and just partly ignore, acknowledge, say please, sorry and thanks, until she's out of oxygen to feed the fire and just stops trying to trigger me. I'm curious what next week will bring. I always have an answer ready, but in this case I have to swallow my words and kill her with kindness.

"Alot of ""Vets"" leaving or being let go- Sales are down YOY- have been since Covid So I have been with this company since 2011. I really enjoy my role and hybrid is a good work option for me with 3 kids so I have flexibility BUT the company has seemed to have drastic moves since 2023- they let go of the COO and of his 4 VPs he had only 1 remains. In 2023 there were layoffs in waves and they have not brought those positions back so every department is thin. The profit margins are still good but sales/orders are down YOY continually.  This year alone my VP was let go and just recently a 12 year long team member who was a manager put their 2 weeks in. The new CEO continues to bring in people from her old company- I am just not sure on the outlook of this company with so many moving parts and every one telling me they are burnt out. They are also being very cheap on trade show attendance and other things that were just ""normal"" .
