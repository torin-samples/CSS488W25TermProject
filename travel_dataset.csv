"Does this Hakone/Odawara day trip plan make sense (and some questions along the way) We're doing a week in Tokyo (Shibuya) in October and are planning on doing a day trip to Hakone and Odawara. Unfortunately we don't have the time to do an overnight trip. I've been trying to plan out this day but am not sure if my plans make sense or are correct. What does everyone think of this itinerary?

1. Get to Tokyo Station and take the Shinkansen to Odawara. I know we can take the Limited Express Romancecar from Shinjuku, but we do want to experience the Shinkansen on this trip, even if it isn't for a very long distance. I think the plan will be to just buy a ticket at the station since I think we want to be flexible about when we leave and we don't want to rush to the station and stress about getting there on time. From what I heard, they leave often enough that we should be okay even without reservations.

2. Get off in Odawara and walk to the Odawara Castle and also maybe explore the town a bit. I don't think most Hakone day-trippers stop here but I heard the castle is cool (even if it's a rebuilt castle and not original) and the town looks nice. It also looks like we can walk to the beach, and it might be nice to talk a look and maybe dip our feet in just to say we stepped into the Pacific. 

3. Take the bus from Odawara to Motohakone-Ko/Lake Ashi. This is where I might need some help. The goal is to get to the boat pier to take the pirate boat across the lake but I'm a little unsure of which bus to get onto. When looking at the Hakone Freepass maps, it looks like whatever bus leaves from the Hakone Yumoto station to get to the lake also originates from the Odawara station, with some stops along the way. I think this is the H bus? Do you think it's worth going back to the Odawara station and taking the train to Hakone to get on this bus? I just don't really know where to get on and how to know it's the right bus.

4. Once we get to Motohakone-Ko/Lake Ashi, walk to the Hakone shrine and the Torii gate (although probably not wait an hour in line to take a picture at the gate).

5. Boat across the lake to Togendai-ko station and take the ropeway to Sōunzan Station. Probably stop Owakudani along the way.

6. and 7. Cable car from Sōunzan Station to Gora and train from Gora to Hakone-Yumoto Station to complete the loop. I'm not sure if we'll stop at the Open Air Museum or not, I think it depends on where we are with time. As a note, since we are going in early October I hope we'll see some autumn foliage in the area. 

8. Limited Express Romancecar from Hakone-Yumoto Station. Question on this, since we do want to get back to Tokyo we should get the Hakone Freepass with roundtrip Odakyu line tickets even if we aren't taking the train round trip, right? And then we can add a one-way upgrade to the Limited Express Romancecar? Will there be any issues if we scan the ticket in Hakone to get to Shinjuku if we didn't scan the ticket on the way there (because we took the Shinkansen)? And it looks like we can reserve a seat on the Romancecar, but like on the way down I'm not sure when we will want to leave and when we'll get back to the station. Does anyone know how often the Limited Express runs, and if we make a reservation and miss it if it's easy to rebook for the next train?

Does this all sound like a good plan? I guess it's the basic Hakope loop with Odawara added in. Some additional questions, but are there any good places along the way to stop for lunch or a snack? And while I know everyone's itinerary depends on how leisurely you want to travel, but how long do you think this will take? We plan to leave Tokyo in the morning and I would like to get back preferably before 8:00pm-ish.",post,r/JapanTravel,Travel,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/1kupxgp/does_this_hakoneodawara_day_trip_plan_make_sense/

"You could skip the universal studio & disney sea days, there just so much more to do & have breaks in both kyoto & Osaka. Given the checkout & checkin times you'll be packing & unpacking for the most part & not slowing down despite such a 3 week itinerary.",comment_1,r/JapanTravel,Travel,,https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/1kupsyd/need_feedback_on_20_days_japan_itinerary_in_dec/
"I think this is pretty solid. Great job on research as it looks somewhat similar to what I would do as well.

Edit-  However, your feet will hate you after Kyoto and Hiroshima/Miyajima. Make day 10 a rest day or take an easy day and take it easy in Osaka also. Go buy one of the heated feet pads that stick underneath your foot. They are godly, and you'll feel way better the next day. I'll send you a photo of the one I always buy when I visit or have a layover if I'm running out.

On the day you go to Fushimi Inari, wake up early! Get there before 8AM or 9AM. I'd say before 8AM, though. Get breakfast at 7/11, Lawson, or Familymart. Buy a bottle of water before heading up. You'll barely see anyone going up or coming down. I think we got there before 8AM and saw a bunch of young students getting off the station as us to get to school. So cute, hah. There are plenty of places to take great photos before the tourist groups show up. We started to head down at 10AM and past a good number of people going up.

For Miyajima, there's high tide and low tide to see the Itsukushima Shrine/Tori Gate. We were so tired and didn't go see the low tide to see if it was walkable. No regrets, the afternoon was beautiful and sunny at Itsukushima Jinja.

How do you plan on booking hotels? I would book them now on like trip and agoda for refundable rates. If the prices get cheaper in the future, you can always cancel and rebook. For amex FHR and chase Edit, prices are usually the cheapest few months out like now. A good amount of hotels on FHR/Edit are refundable as well. Same for IHG if you plan on using reward points. Book now and rebook if cheaper. Just check every other week.",comment_2,r/JapanTravel,Travel,,https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/1kupsyd/need_feedback_on_20_days_japan_itinerary_in_dec/
"20-day Japan Itinerary. How well have we planned so far? Hi everyone!



My partner and I are planning a trip to Japan in November. I've been to Japan last year without any solid itinerary (it was an impulse solo trip) but it's my partner's first, so I have quite a solid background for expectations but would still like to get everyone's suggestions and input. I visited Tokyo, Shirakawa-go, Takayama, Kyoto, and Osaka (half day trip) last year if the context helps.



We're really keen on having a balanced itinerary where we have some relaxing/flexible days but also some days where it’s a bit overloaded. Our main priority is to eat good food, stay at a Ryokan, have time to shop, do some hikes (we both love nature), and visit some tourist traps that we have dreamt of going together for the longest time (all will be bolded). Depending on who’s playing in the Japanese SVL this coming season, we might also adjust and make some time to watch a game. Here's our current plan so far:



November 7 - Fly to Japan



November 8 - Arrive in Tokyo

* Land in HND @ 7:00pm
* We expect to get to our hotel around 9-9:30pm (due to customs) near Kayabacho station



November 9 - Asakusa/Ueno/Akihabara

* Tokyo City Flea Market
* Morning: Asakusa (Senso-ji, Nakamise-dori, Kappabashi street)
* Afternoon/Evening: Ueno (Ameyokocho, Ueno Park)
* Optional: Akihabara



November 10 - Tsukiji Market

* If weather is not nice: Shopping
   * Ginza
   * Roppongi Hills
   * Vintage shopping



November 11 - Tokyo Disney Sea (TBD)

* We are not set on Tokyo Disney Sea but we would love everyone’s opinion on the park itself or any other ideas for things to do
* Nikko day-trip instead?



November 12 - Tokyo to Nagano

* Morning: Take the shinkansen to Nagano station
* Morning/Afternoon: Zenko-ji temple, walk around Obuse
* Evening: Check-in at our hotel, south of Nagano station (40 minute bus ride)



November 13 - Nagano

* Morning: Togakushi Shrine (hike), Kagami-ike pond
* Afternoon/Evening: Explore Nagano city a bit more



November 14 - Nagano to Tajimi

* Morning: Head to Nagoya station to meet our friend who lives in Tajimi
   * Potentially stop at Matsumoto before Nagoya station
* Afternoon/Evening: Will be with our friend who will take us around



November 15 - Tajimi



November 16 - Nagoya to Kyoto

* Morning: Take the shinkansen to Kyoto
* Afternoon: **Kiyomizu-dera**, Nishiki Market, Pontocho, Gion district



November 17 - Kyoto (kinda free day - open to suggestions)

* Afternoon: Kyoto Gyoen National Garden
* Evening: Free



November 18 - Kyoto

* Morning: Arashiyama park, Okochi Sanso Garden

* Afternoon: Osaka castle (optional)
* Evening: Osaka food crawl, Dotonbori street



November 20 - Osaka/Minoh Falls

* Morning/Afternoon: Minoh park/falls day trip

November 21 - Osaka (Free day - open to suggestions)

* Morning/Afternoon: Maybe go back to Nara/Kyoto
* Evening: Quick trip to **Kobe just for Kobe beef dinner**



November 22 - Osaka to Hakone

* Morning: Have lunch in Kobe if we haven’t been then head to Hakone
* Afternoon: **Relax at our Ryokan**, maybe go around Hakone



November 23 - Hakone

* All day: Hakone loop



November 24 - Hakone to Tokyo

* Morning: Take the Shinkansen to Tokyo
* Afternoon: TBD/Free
* Evening: TBD/Free

November 25 - Tokyo

November 25 - Tokyo (**Kamakura/Enoshima** or shopping day)

* Day-trip to Kamakura, if we have not been already
* Morning/Afternoon: Shibuya/Harajuku
* Evening: Sunset at Shibuya Sky?, Roppongi, Ginza



November 26 - Tokyo (Mt Fuji)

* Depending on weather, we might take the expressway bus to Kawaguchiko station and spend our day there, if weather is not good then we will most likely just stay in Tokyo to shop and sight-see on things that we missed (open to recommendations)



November 27 - Tokyo

* Open for last minute shopping and exploration (open to recommendations)



November 28 - Tokyo

* Morning/Afternoon: Free
* Evening: Flight at 9:55pm (HND)



Our 3-day trip to Hakone isn’t really set and we are open to other places with similar vibes, as long as there is a ryokan that we can stay in. 



We were also considering doing the Nakasendo trail and/or staying in Kinosaki Onsen but just not too sure if there’s a way for us to fit those in there.



Upon writing this post I realize that some day might actually be too empty?? So I’d appreciate any suggestions/recommendations on any other places to visit, restaurants, or even on how to manage each day of our trip better.

Either go to Kagoshima with the shinkansen or fly there from Osaka and rent a car on the island. You will not regret it.

"(Translated using DeepL)

Sorry, did you make a line break in the wrong place? It's hard to read.

The Expo honestly doesn't have a very good reputation, which is why I'm not interested at all. If you were to go to the Expo, having it on the same day as Kurashiki doesn't seem like a very good idea. It would be a long and hectic distance to travel. How many hours do you plan to stay in each?

Where will you stay on days 6 and 7? Your plan says you will go to Hiroshima on day 6 and stay in Osaka on day 7, but will go from Osaka to Hiroshima again on day 8. Sorry if my interpretation is wrong.",comment_1,r/JapanTravel,Travel,,https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/1kufjtl/kansai_region_10_day_itinerary_check/
"Frankly speaking, Kurashiki's Bikan Historical Quarter alone might be too long to spend a whole day there. Unless you want to visit other places as well. For example, the Bikan Historical Quarter is home to the oldest western art museum in Japan. You may not be interested in visiting a Western art museum when you come to Japan, but it is an example.

However, you may want to prepare for a “blank day” to give yourself a chance to visit places you couldn't in Osaka. If you have extra time, you could go to Hiroshima early, or spend the day at a cafe.",comment_2,r/JapanTravel,Travel,,https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/1kufjtl/kansai_region_10_day_itinerary_check/

Spend the night of Day 7 there as well
Go past tomonoura before going back yo Osaka on Day 8

"I'm glad I pointed that out.

About Kyoto... probably a very busy schedule. At least the Nintendo Museum is not a place you can finish seeing in an hour, so think carefully.

About Expo. Of course if you guys want to go there there is no reason to complain about it. Just be extra careful because it's very dangerous to move around in the summer. If you guys are white, sunglasses are a must. And no matter what race you are, you should definitely wear a hat. You may also want to have a small towel to wipe your sweat and some water to wet it and wipe your body. Just be really careful about dehydration and heat stroke. As for summer temperatures and humidity, it's dangerous enough to take a trip to Mars, so take adequate precautions. If you feel sick, you should never push yourself and seek help from those around you. I'm not saying this to scare you. Several people die every year.

Now, if you go to Hiroshima in the summer, it is lemon season. You haven't write anything about gourmet food, so I'm going to suggest this. And you go to Kurashiki, look for peaches and muscat grapes. They may be a bit expensive, but I guarantee the taste.",comment_4,r/JapanTravel,Travel,,https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/1kufjtl/kansai_region_10_day_itinerary_check/

"Have you put your Tokyo destinations into Googlemaps and thought about travel? For example, your day two has you starting in Harajuku, travelling half an hour on the train to have lunch at a very specific tonkatsu place in Roppongi (when there are hundreds of restaurants just there in Harajuku or Shibuya), going right across the centre of town to Senso-ji and Skytree, and then all the way back to Shibuya (a good hour or so in transit each way) to see a pedestrian crossing (meh - I just don’t get the tourist obsession with it) and have dinner…

Day three’s “Travel to Mount Fuji” is delightfully vague. It’s an enormous mountain that can be seen (if you are lucky) from much of central Japan. You’re going to have narrow down where you are going to

Many things at Nishiki market close by 6pm. I don’t hate it as too touristy like many do (one of my favourite ceramic makers is there), but it is IMO very much a “get there at about ten am when things start opening and run away before the hordes descend” kind of place.",comment_1,r/JapanTravel,Travel,,https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/1kumqfc/japan_itinerary_check_tokyo_kyoto_osaka_okinawa/

"7 Night October Tokyo Itinerary Check Does this itinerary make sense for 7 nights in Tokyo?

My partner has travel/crowd anxiety, so I tried to rotate between a busy day and a relaxed day. We’re planning on staying in Ginza. We like anime, video games, gardens, and good food. We’re not interested in Disney or the Ghibli Museum.



Day 1 -Wed 10/1: Shinkansen - Fukuoka to Tokyo (We’ll be staying with friends in Fukuoka for a week including 2 nights at an onsen ryokan before going solo to Tokyo)



Day 2 - Thur 10/2: Magical Trip Tokyo Tour - Tsukiji Fish Market, Akihabara, Asakusa (\~5hrs).



Day 3 - Fri 10/3: Hamarikyu Gardens and Tea House, Wagyu dinner in Ginza



Day 4 - Sat 10/4: I'm thinking about swapping this to a week day for less crowds.

Kamakura and Enoshima Day Trip: Tsurugaoka Hachimangu shrine, Hase-dera temple, Kōtoku-in (Buddha statue), and Enoshima Island (\~10 hrs)



Day 5 - Sun 10/5: Rest at hotel, evening Shinjuku food tour with Magical Trip (\~3hrs).



Day 6 - Mon 10/6: Should I add more here?

Akihabara Day: Square Enix Cafe or Final Fantasy Eorzea Café, Shopping (super potato, Retro Game Camp, Hard Off, Otachu), and Gigo gaming arcade then Okonomiyaki dinner (in Ginza),



Day 7 - Tue 10/7: Not sure what to do the last day. Suggestions?

Maybe Pokémon Center Tokyo DX, Tokyo tower, and teamLab Borderless.

Or Tokyo Skytree which seems further out of the way. The aquarium and planetarium by Tokyo Skytree sounded interesting, but I noticed reviews seemed mixed for them.

Dinner omakase in Ginza



Day 8 - Wed 10/8: Fly out of Tokyo",post,r/JapanTravel,Travel,2.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/1kuf7jv/7_night_october_tokyo_itinerary_check/
"For the distance between Fukuoka and Tokyo, I’d rather do a domestic flight, to be honest. Fukuoka’s airport is super near the city and the entire flight takes about half the time of the Shinkansen—plus maybe it’s cheaper too. 

As for the last day I would suggest many of Tokyo’s indoor theme parks. They’re like theme parks and arcades rolled into one. Tokyo Joypolis is one that comes up a lot.

These days whenever I go to Tokyo, I try to travel out of the city as much as possible. I’d suggest exploring smaller neighborhoods (Koenji, Yanaka, Nakameguro, etc.) Places like Nikko and Hakone are good ideas also. Yes, they’re crowded if you do day trips, but if you can afford to stay overnight, you’re often the first one at every attraction the morning after.",comment_1,r/JapanTravel,Travel,,https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/1kuf7jv/7_night_october_tokyo_itinerary_check/
"Don't visit Kamakura on the weekend. You'll have a ton of weekend visitors from Tokyo on top of the international tourists. It will be a big logistical hassle, regardless of your anxiety. Same goes for Hakone, Nikko, and other weekend getaways. Also, be aware that Enoshima island is a 30-minute train + 15/20 minute walk from Kamakura station. 

Yokohama might be a good day trip idea. There are some good gardens between Sankeien garden, the Yamate area, and Yamashita park. For food, there's Chinatown.",comment_2,r/JapanTravel,Travel,,https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/1kuf7jv/7_night_october_tokyo_itinerary_check/

"Hama-Rikyu Garden is very near the Tsukiji Fish Market, just a short stroll away. It would make sense to do those on the same day.

Re the SkyTree, it is very near the famous Senso-ji shrine, something to consider.

One of the highlights for us in Tokyo was the Meiji-Jingu shrine in Yoyogi Park, also very near to Harajuku, if that is of interest.

Have a great trip!",comment_4,r/JapanTravel,Travel,,https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/1kuf7jv/7_night_october_tokyo_itinerary_check/
"Trip Report - May 2025 (Tokyo) Dates: May 12-22

I stayed in Tokyo exclusively and took day trips to surrounding areas. I would say that even one full month in Tokyo would be sufficient. There’s so much to see! I spent most of my trip wandering around and shopping. Didn’t visit any major attractions aside from Donki. 

The Good:

1. Suica- I successfully set up Suica on my phone using a Visa card after speaking to customer service. I’m thankful I was able to resolve the Visa issue before arriving in Japan. I could use Suica as payment at pretty much every store/restaurant I visited in Japan with the exception of cash only shops and Kura Sushi for some reason. 

2. General affordability of food - I think it’s possible to visit Japan on a budget as good food (and transit) is abundant and cheap. I got yakisoba from a grocery store for ¥329 and juice for around ¥129. It was a pleasant surprise considering even McDonald’s here in Canada is almost $15 / ¥1500 for a meal nowadays. I ate primarily at chain restaurants, konbinis, and hole-in-the-wall spots. 

3. Shopping selection - There’s something for everyone and at every budget. I was blown away by the variety of department stores and malls. My favourite chain shop was Village Vanguard by far. Definitely recommend for the weird girlies ! Their two-storey branch in Koenji had an excellent selection of manga and interesting art books. 

4. Transit & Google Maps - Need no explanation for this one. 

5. Good customer service - I loved how store employees would make their presence be known but still leave you alone for the most part. It’s a good balance between the suffocating salesperson attitude and straight up ignoring found at most stores (Aritzia) where I’m from. I also appreciated NOT being followed around or watched - a common experience for me as a mixed-race person. 

6. GU - I could’ve brought one change of clothes and then bought the rest at GU. Prices were affordable and the clothing felt decent quality-wise. Japanese Women’s L and Men’s S did me well as someone who is slightly larger than Free Size. 

The Bad

1. Other tourists - I’m sorry, but, some of you are very embarrassing to be around. I’m sure it’s no one in this subreddit though haha. I noticed Brits were common culprits of unsavoury behaviour (talking loud on the train, speaking to staff ENTIRELY in English, stopping for no reason in busy walkways) which was surprising as I thought Americans would win that title. Please remind your friends, family, coworkers, idk, to do better. Also, please shower and wear deodorant. 

2. Pet stores - I wanted to purchase some accessories for my dog so I figured the local pet shop would have something. What a mistake. I left a sobbing mess from witnessing the deplorable conditions that puppies and kittens experience.

3. Buying tickets at Family Mart - HIIIGHLY recommend reading the English tutorial of the FamiMart multicopier machine before attempting buy tickets. It was extremely stressful but easy once I figured it out after a while. Input your hotel’s phone number at the end. Be quick as a line will build behind you. More of these machines are needed badly LOL.

General Tips/Observations: 

- Set up Suica before you leave. Makes your arrival process much quicker too. 

- Wear a good mask on transit. It’s true - people will just cough into the air… gross… Also, I found some trains to have a weird aroma (kinda rank?) that my mask was able to block out for the most part. 

- Study as much Japanese as you can before you depart. Most people don’t speak English there, and why should they? I would’ve benefited from more listening practice as I froze up the first few days when people would speak to me 😭😭 Very embarrassing but I apologized profusely and adapted.

- Check drug stores before Donki for beauty and grocery stores before konbinis for food. The price differences weren’t outrageous but can make a difference for those on strict budgets. 

- On Donki, I visited the location in Akihabara in the late morning on a weekday and it was pretty quiet which was a relief. I didn’t buy much (I think I spent only ¥2000 LOL) but thought it was cool to walk through. One visit was enough for me. It felt like a vertical Walmart. I passed by the Mega Donki branch in Shibuya and that looked like a nightmare. Shibuya in general was nightmarish. 

In summary, Tokyo can, and should, be done on its own or at least given a massive chunk of time. I can’t wait to return! Next time, I’ll spend more time in nature :) !",post,r/JapanTravel,Travel,20.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/1ku1zn2/trip_report_may_2025_tokyo/

"3-Week Active Adventure – Tokyo, Yakushima, Campervan Road Trip, & More! Hi r/JapanTravel! My partner and I are heading to Japan in June for a ~3-week trip. We’re active travelers who love hiking, scuba/snorkeling, hot springs, cultural immersion (previous adventures have included Dia De Los Muertos in Mexico City and running of the bulls in Spain), connecting with locals, and food -- especially seafood. When it was time to finally celebrate our honeymoon (5 yrs after getting married, thanks covid!) we immediately thought of Japan! 

Now, our trip is just around the corner. We’ve planned a pretty ambitious itinerary that includes Tokyo, Yakushima, Kyoto, a campervan road trip — and would love your recommendations. Overall approach to travel is to book lodging, bookmark potential experiences (and reserve only those that are absolutely essential), and explore from there, not plan everything down to the minute.

A bit more about us: From a New England fishing family so boat fresh seafood is a must. We love to chase epic sunrises (usually via hike) and spend sunsets chilling by the water with a drink (and good food!). We're very active (30k-50k steps a day when we travel) and experienced hikers, but we're not into overnight hikes. We generally prefer more dive-y places to eat and drink and will occasionally dress up for a fancy cocktail.

I've outlined our plans below and would be deeply appreciative of your recommendations, in particular for:
- Spots with an epic sunset view to enjoy a drink in any of these cities (maybe rooftop bars?)
- Recommended sunrise hikes or vistas 
- In general, stopovers or hidden gems/neighborhoods great to explore on foot for the driving portion of the trip
- Can't miss artisinal bakeries and pastry shops 
- Hands on pottery experiences 
- Spots for an impromptu skinny dip? 

And a more general question, you'll see our planned van route follows the Kii Peninsula before tacking inland to Takayama in the Japanese Alps. My sense was that there may not be enough on the peninsula itself to warrant slower, day-to-day exploration and figured it'd be cool to see yet another region of Japan. Is that right? Is Takayama mountain region worth seeking out, especially after we're likely to get our fill of mountains/cooler weather in Yakushima? 

Thanks in advance!

Thanks so much in advance. We can’t wait to explore Japan, and appreciate any insights from fellow travelers who’ve been!",post,r/JapanTravel,Travel,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/1kui5dm/3week_active_adventure_tokyo_yakushima_campervan/
"Some quick thoughts:



1. I went to Yakushima in 2017 and stayed there for three days. This part looks like a pretty solid list of activities for the island. Just keep in mind that travelling around the island is tricky unless you have your own transport. 



2. Why take a train from Kagoshima to Osaka? The trip is going to take over five hours, and that’s AFTER a long ferry ride also. I recommend taking a domestic flight instead for this leg. It’s faster and likely much cheaper also.



3. I visited Kii Peninsula early last year and hiked the Kumano Kodo. I had a wonderful time hiking the Kumano Kodo, and this multi-day hike is maybe something you want to consider also. Yes, you guys don’t like overnight hikes, but Kumano Kodo has many overnight inns along the way if you book ahead of time. Even if you don’t want to hike the entire length, it is possible to DRIVE alongside the route and pop in and out of the car to hike portions of the historic trail. Basically, instead of going around the Kii Peninsula, you cut across it via the Kumano Kodo and will end up at the Kumano Nachi Taisha anyway.



4. There are mountains in Yakushima, sure, but they do not compare to the ones in the Japanese Alps—so no, I don’t think you should skip the area around Takayama. 



5. Please do not skinny dip in Japan unless it happens to be an open-air hot spring (like Hirauchi Kaichu Onsen on Yakushima). It is very much frowned upon if spotted by the locals. Nobody appreciates this behaviour locally.



6. Take a look into the Izu Peninsula if you are looking for sunset spots. It’s on the way back to Tokyo anyway. 



7. If you guys like hiking, here are some great hiking spots roughly along the route you are driving: Mount Hoo, Mount Kisokoma, and Kamikochi. ",comment_1,r/JapanTravel,Travel,,https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/1kui5dm/3week_active_adventure_tokyo_yakushima_campervan/

"8 Day Itinerary Check 8 Day Itinerary check

This will be my second trip to Japan, but the first for my parents. They’re not particularly interested in temples or traditional shrines, so I’ve tried to steer the itinerary toward a focus on **green tea culture, onsen experiences, and scenic relaxation**, while still offering a diverse regional mix.

I’d love a **general check on the pacing and city selection**, rather than an in-depth activity breakdown. Thoughts?

Super good decision to stay overnight in Hakone. People always do day trips to Hakone then complain about it being crowded. The wife and I stayed overnight in an onsen hotel in Hakone and were the first people at basically every attraction the morning after.

"Ended up changing this June 17-19 to Kyoto since the transportation is more convenient. And then Uji can be a day trip.

ALSO - you're right about the kinosaki onsen. takes 6+ hours to narita. 5+ at least for haneda

will swap it so we will train and leave from kansai airport as per u/harrylam2210's suggestion (thank you!) which takes 4 hours!

"Kyushu 12-13 Day Itinerary Check [First Time in Kyushu!] Hi Reddit peeps, planning a trip to Kyushu this Autumn (mid/late Nov). It would be my 3rd time in Japan and 4th for my partner. We both have been to Tokyo, Osaka, Kyoto, and their nearby prefectures. Some of our travel preferences:

* Nagano and Enoshima were our favorite spots/prefecture from our previous trips
* It'll be our first time in Kyushu and we're planning to drive around
* We both love onsens, especially the ones with outdoor, nature-filled backdrops
* We love scenic routes and hoping we can catch the autumn foliage
* Looking for a mid-paced travel (not too packed but not too leisurely either. Our previous trip felt too rushed as we were traveling around the Kanto region + stops in Osaka over a week plus)
* We're into history and museums, not particularly interested in shrines

***Unconfirmed info:*** As there's no direct flights into any part of Kyushu from my country, we're still choosing whether to fly direct to FUK (via transit flight) OR fly direct into Osaka, make our way to Fukuoka via train and fly back out here, or a combination of the above. We intend to focus our trip in Kyushu but I'm undecided between which option would be the most time & cost effective.

I've spend hours researching on Kyushu routes and attractions, Japan travel still feels so overwhelming because there's so many things to look into but reddit has been a great help, and I've incorporated tips & advices from various other threads into this 1st draft but could use some help from seasoned folks whether this itinerary makes sense.

**The places listed beside each ""Day"" is the base for the day**

**Day 1 - Fukuoka (Arrive in the AM)**

\- Ohorikoen, Canal City, Gundam Lalaport, Fukuoka Museum

\- Teamlabs? \*Uncertain, we've never been before to the Tokyo one

\- Yatai @ Nakasu

**Day 2 - Fukuoka**

\-  AM: Itoshima Day Trip?

\-  Evening: Uminonakamichi: Rent bike, check flower field

**Day 3 - Nagasaki**

\- AM: Take train to Nagasaki & collect car there

\- Nagasaki Peace Park, Museum of History, Urakami Cathedral, Oura Church, Meganebashi Bridge

\- PM: Mt Inasa night view

**Day 4 - Nagasaki**

\- AM: Gunkanjima tour  
  
\- PM: Anythg else worth checking? Dejima Wharf or Hirado? 

**Day 5 - Kumamoto**

\- AM: Leave Nagasaki and drive to Shimabara Port via Unzen. Return car at Shimabara and take ferry to Kumamoto

\- Sakuranobaba Johsaien, shopping at Shimotori Shopping Arcade  
  
\- Aso Farm Land (Confession: one of the main reasons I chose Kyushu it's because I wanted to see beavers up close lol and it's either Nagasaki Bio Park or Aso Farm Land)

\- Stay at Fujino Villa?

**Day 6 - Kumamoto**

\- AM: Drive around Mt Aso, consider hike if weather is good?

\- Check out Kokonoe Bridge?

\- Evening: Drive to Kurokawa Onsen for overnight stay

**Day 7 - Kumamoto/Kagoshima**

\- AM to Mid Noon: Head to Takachiho Gorge + Takachiho Amaterasu Railway

\- Evening: Return car, take train to Kagoshima

**Day 8 - Kagoshima**

\- AM: Collect car

\- Shiroyama Observatory, Sengan-en Garden, Sakurajima Volcano

\- Is Ibusuki worth visiting?

\- Evening: Return car, take train back to Fukuoka

**Day 9 - Fukuoka**

\- Day trip to Kokura via train

\- Kokura Castle & Wisteria Gardens

\- Chill evening/night

**Day 10 - Fukuoka**

\- Day trip to Oita/Yufuin/Yanagawa? (Not sure about these places yet as many Redditors mentioned they're pretty touristy/overrated)

**Day 11 - Fukuoka/Osaka (If we're flying back from Osaka)**

\- Chill morning in Fukuoka

\- Take Sunflower Ferry to Osaka

**Day 12 - Osaka**

\- Chill at Osaka

\- Flight back

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Some questions:

\- Does the itinerary make sense route wise? Or are there more cost/time saving routes we could consider? Since we haven't booked our flights, our itinerary is still very flexible and I hope to optimize the trip by having a pretty solid idea first of where we're getting around and how much time we need

\- Are there places/attractions we \*MUST\* see or we should cut out/not worth going?

\- Is this first draft too packed? We're in our mid 30s so I need to keep in mind we're not the spring chickens we used to be lol. Just want to make sure we have enough time at each stop to soak in and enjoy the place sufficiently

"Day 4 Nagasaki. Can recommend Dejima and Clover Park. Suwa Shrine is worth going just for the tori gates. Its a hidden gem, kind of mini fushimi inari and best part no one is there. 

Day 8. Ibusuki was very memorable. The sand bath was fun. But takes awhile to get there. I would not fit it on the same day you are gonig to sengan and sakurajima. 

For Mt Aso, def check out Diakanbo lookout and Kusenrigahama. 

If I were you, I cut back a day or two in fukuoka and maybe look into yufuin or extra day kagoshima. Yufuin main street is busy but step one block away and you have the river and the rice paddies. Get to see mount yufu and it is quiet. It also has a bunch of onsen options and small attractions. I like the showa museum as its kind of like a smithsonian museum for capturing japanese life from postwar to the 80s. I haven't been but maybe try out Yakushima National Park if you are into nature.",comment_1,r/JapanTravel,Travel,,https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/1ku5zrq/kyushu_1213_day_itinerary_check_first_time_in/
"We chose to fly into Fukuoka which like you, meant a transit flight - we went via Singapore. The airport in Fukuoka is so close to the city it’s very convenient.

We stayed in Tenjin in Fukuoka which we loved for eating and shopping.

Are you think of staying in Fujino Villa in Aso? We stayed there! It’s a cute little cabin and good value. We were there after two nights in a ryokan in Kurokawa Onsen so it was nice to make our own food with supplies for the supermarket in Aso.

"Definitely book in your TeamLab Planets tickets in now they will sell out or you get an awkward time ie. Lunch or dinner.

Maybe look at Meiji Shrine, it’s so close to Harajuku you could look at doing it on the same day rather than do it when you do the Shinjuku day.

Also in Hakone I assume you are doing the loop (pirate ship, cable car, black eggs etc?) - you can forward your luggage same day when you reach Hakone at the station but you need cash.",comment_4,r/JapanTravel,Travel,,https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/1kuf8no/help_perfecting_itenerary_i_leave_in_12_days/

"For anyone interested in riding the entire Shimanami Kaido AND going to Rabbit Island in one day We wanted to cycle the whole route (Onomichi to Imabari) and go to Rabbit Island. I haven’t seen many Reddit posts with people doing this so thought I’d share our experience. 

We were staying in Hiroshima, so we took the 6:20 Shinkansen which got into Shin-Onomichi at 6:51. The station is small so we got out quickly and hopped straight in a taxi that was waiting outside the station. We arrived at the [bike terminal] (https://maps.app.goo.gl/YePnf7ASmreZwuCE7?g_st=com.google.maps.preview.copy) by about 7AM and there were already a few people ahead of us. We didn’t book bikes because the weather was looking a bit hit and miss and we knew we didn’t want to cycle in the rain. My advice would be to absolutely [book bikes] (https://shimanami-cycle.or.jp/go-shimanami/experience/447/) if you want any kind of electric bike. They were all out of the e-assist bikes but luckily had a few e-bikes left so we were able to get those. They have tonnes of cross bikes so if you’re not fussed getting an electric one you should be fine to just turn up. A note here - we are both experienced cyclists. My partner is a club cyclist and I am a commuter cyclist. Before the ride we both thought the ~70km would be pretty easy for us to do on regular cross bikes, but ended up deciding to get e-bikes because we wanted to do rabbit island too. On reflection, it would have been too ambitious for us to do the whole ride on push bikes, and have enough time to do rabbit island. As mentioned before, there are some pretty steep inclines to get on to the bridges which I hadn’t anticipated would be quite so long. 

It took us about 6 hours to get from Onomichi to Imabari. We weren’t cycling flat out, and we had our e-bikes on the lowest setting for most of the ride to preserve battery (with the exception being to go up those aforementioned inclines!). We had lots of stops along the way, there are tonnes of toilets and vending machines which we frequently stopped at. We also stopped for 45 minutes or so for lunch. 

We arrived at Imabari at around 2pm, had a quick bite to eat and then got in a taxi to go to Sakari Port on Ōmishima Island. We couldn’t find another way to get there so concluded a taxi was our only way. You might be able to stop along the way and catch the ferry over to the island, but we weren’t sure if we could take bikes with us on the ferry and were worried if we did this we would miss the last time to drop off our bikes at Imabari. The taxi was expensive… but I wanted to see the bunnies so I was ready to pay lol. The taxi was approx ¥12,000 which included the tolls. Once we got to the port at Sakari we had to wait a while for the ferry. I believe they run every hour or so. We missed one by about 20 minutes so we had a 50 minute wait.

We were able to buy a ticket to rabbit island, and then another ticket to take the ferry onward to the mainland (to Tadanoumi) from rabbit island. The ferry was ¥360 per trip.

After about an hour on Rabbit Island we caught the ferry to Tadanoumi port. From here we took a JR train to Takehara and then caught an expressway bus on to Hiroshima for ¥1400. We caught the final bus of the day to Hiroshima at 18:16 so just be aware of this as a hard cut off. The bus was a surprise highlight for us! It was peaceful (in the UK we’d call it a “coach” rather than a bus) and winds its way through the hills back to Hiroshima.

It was a very long day - we left our hotel in Hiroshima at 5:45 and didn’t get back until 19:45 and we spent quite a bit of money with all the different types of public transport, plus e-bikes, but it was totally worth it. Just putting this post out there in case anyone is also planning a trip like I was and wanting to work out if they can do the whole ride and see the bunnies :)

"It will be a long day but it is feasible. Have done the Shimanami Kaido myself as a day trip from Hiroshima before. Important to note In October sunset will be around 5pm in Japan so you’d need to get up early. 

If you get the Shinkansen from Shin Osaka to Fukuyama and get a good transfer to the local train to Onomichi it will take about 1 hour 40 minutes. Think the OP must have got a taxi from Shin-Onomichi as the Shinkansen doesn’t go to Onomichi station itself. 

The cycle from Onomichi to Imabari can take around 4-6 hours. You can then get a highway bus back over the Shimanami Kaido from Imabari to Fukuyama to then catch the Shinkansen back to Osaka.",comment_4,r/JapanTravel,Travel,,https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/1ktg122/for_anyone_interested_in_riding_the_entire/

"Osaka, Okayama or Okinawa for 3 nights - trying to avoid overwhelming crowds and Instagram spots Been to Japan twice before and by far my favourite parts of each trip were the  stopovers in quaint rural areas, or places that I randomly ended up in, non touristy sites where you just could get lost in the local areas and observing how people live. 

This time I need help choosing where to go for 3 nights in Japan! My choices are Okayama, Osaka and Okinawa. It would be Sunday eve - Wednesday AM. So 3 nights 2 days.

As I only have 3 nights I've heard okinawa might not be great as it would be hard to leave Naha.

Okayama looks a bit off the beaten path, but maybe for a reason as I've read it's an industrial city? But if I could use it for a base to visit any surrounding areas maybe it's an option?

Osaka I've heard mixed reviews about, everyone says to stay at dotonburi, but is it a bit too crowded? Would it be like staying in shibuya? Leaving your hotel to herds of people?

Basically I'm trying to avoid overwhelming crowds and Instagram spots. I've learned over the years that I can't stand this kind of travel.

Would love any advice or if anyone could tell me if I've misunderstood anything!

"Tokyo-Kyoto itinerary check Hi!! I built this itinerary and I was wondering if it's unrealistic, overly ambitious, or otherwise wonky.  

Notes: 
- First-timer in Japan. 
- Times are all rough approximations for pacing.
- I do not care much for shopping, anime/manga, teamlabs, etc. I lean nature-oriented. 
- since my trip is pretty condensed, I don't think luggage shipping is ideal (maybe it is?). To err on the side of caution, I still plan to book the oversized luggage seats on the shinkansen. 
- I am coming from South Korea so jetlag is not a concern. 
- For Tokyo, I am staying in Chuo City. For Kyoto, I am staying in Kawaramachi.

 If you're only interested in taking a photo outside every destination and not planning on getting into anywhere I'd say it's doable.

"[Itinerary Check] 3-Week Active + Cultural Japan Adventure – Tokyo, Yakushima, Campervan Road Trip, Mt. Fuji, Kyoto & More! Hi r/JapanTravel! My husband and I are heading to Japan next month for a ~3-week trip. This is our big delayed honeymoon (covid wedding to coincide with our 5 yr anniversary), so we're really trying to plan the trip of our DREAMS. We’re active/experienced travelers who love hiking, scuba/snorkeling, cultural immersion experiences (e.g. past trips were centered around Dia de Los Muertos in Mexico City and Running of the Bulls in Pamplona), and FOOD. We're very adventurous eaters and come from a New England fishing family. We feel most comfortable in more local/cozy/divey settings but every once in while like a fancy splurge. We are NOT into amusement parks or tourist traps, but appreciate kitsch every now and then. Our travel style is 3-4 super active days (~30-40K steps a day) followed by a day or so of rest and chill. We’ve planned a pretty ambitious itinerary that includes Tokyo, Yakushima, Osaka, Kyoto, and a campervan road trip into the Alps and Five Lakes region -- and would love your thoughts!

**June 10–11: Travel to Tokyo**

* Fly into Narita (arrive June 11 early afternoon)

* Check into hotel (Chiyoda neighborhood)

* Intentionally keeping this loosely planned but exploring Ginza (food!) is a priority

**June 14: Travel to Kagoshima**

* Fly to Kagoshima in the morning and again, explore this city lightly as we adjust
* Volcano hike 

**June 15–20: Yakushima**

Activities planned/booked with help from YES Yakushima:

* Taikoiwa Rock hike

* Snorkeling at Isso Beach

* Scuba diving

* Nighttime turtle watching tour

* Jomon Sugi hike 

* Soaking in Hirauchi Kaichu

**June 20–21: Osaka**

* Ferry back to Kagoshima → bullet train to Osaka
 
* EAT EAT EAT: Explore Dotombori and Kuromon Ichiba, maybe catch a Hanshin Tigers game (planning to scalp tickets)

**June 21–24: Kyoto**

Train to Kyoto, staying in Southern Higashiyama

Planned activities:

* Walk Gion and Higashiyama by night

* Visit Sanjusangen-do, Nishiki Market, Nijo Castle, Fushimi sake district, and Manga Museum

**June 27:**

* Drive north to Gifu -- overnight in swordsmith town (Seki)

**June 28:**

* Drive to Takayama – explore historic old town, sake breweries, shops

**June 29:**

* Morning market, then drive to Mt. Fuji Lakes region

* Check into resort (splurging on a spot with private onsen and Mt Fuji views)

**June 30:**

* Check out & drive to Narita (drop off van)

* Optional omakase dinner to celebrate the trip

**July 1–2: Final Days in Tokyo**

* Chill day in Tokyo – Gotel near Shibuya 

* Last-minute shopping or one final adventure

**July 2: Fly home via Haneda**


**A Few Questions for All of You:**

* Tips and tricks for finding a campervan. Our rental company provides a list of available sites across the country. In our prior experience (US Southwest) we never rented a camper spot, just winged it. Wondering if the same loosey gooseyness is wise in Japan. 
  
* Any hidden gems or small fishing towns or unique rest stops along the peninsula route we should stop by? 

* How unique of an experience is a Hanshin game? Wondering if we should prioritize it or spend that time exploring Osaka more.

"Hita Kyushu trip report I'm writing this post today because I didn't find many trip reports about Hita on this subreddit.

We spent 25 days in Japan as part of a longer 5-month journey. We really enjoyed Kyushu. In particular, we loved our night in Yufuin at a Ryokan with an onsen. After visiting Beppu, we wanted to return to a quiet mountain town and enjoy one last Ryokan experience before our flight out of Fukuoka.

Geographically, it made sense to stop in Hita, as the city is about halfway between Beppu and Fukuoka via the limited express train.

First, I should mention that we're not AOT (Attack on Titan) fans. We didn’t find much information online, except that some people refer to Hita as the ""Little Kyoto of Kyushu.""

We booked a night at a Ryokan located in the main tourist area (near Mamedamachi Shopping Street). I won’t advertise the name here, but it was a great experience : spotless room, traditional ambiance, and a nice onsen.

The neighborhood is very charming, dotted with traditional houses and small, quiet temples. There's a very peaceful atmosphere, and the river running alongside it adds to the charm. Even if you’re not into AOT, there are still a few things to see (Japanese doll museum, sake brewery). It’s enough to fill a day. There are also enough cafés and lunch spots. Overall, the day went by quickly, it was very relaxing to stroll around Hita. We saw very few Western tourists; most of the visitors were Korean.

In the evening, we mainly enjoyed our time at the Ryokan. We had dinner outside. There are far fewer restaurants open at night, and the area becomes very quiet, with not much in the way of nightlife or open shops.

Is Hita worth visiting? Yes, for its old district and peaceful vibe. Is it worth staying overnight? Yes, if you have accommodation that you truly enjoy spending time in; otherwise, the town might feel a bit too quiet after 6 pm. We probably preferred Yufuin because the scenery there is more striking, but we definitely don’t regret our stop in Hita : it allowed us to spend more time enjoying the mountains of Kyushu.

"Cool! I’m heading there myself this November. Just out of curiosity, did you visit Onta pottery village nearby, or do any shopping for Onta ware in Hita? I’m in two minds about visiting Onta, because I’m a huge fan of ceramics, but I don’t drive, and buses there and back seem very infrequent.",comment_1,r/JapanTravel,Travel,,https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/1kt7jdu/hita_kyushu_trip_report/
"Sorry, I didn’t go there, my stay was very short. However, I did pass by the bus station and it seemed quite well connected, with buses going in many directions regularly. I hope you’ll find what you’re looking for once you’re there.",comment_2,r/JapanTravel,Travel,,https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/1kt7jdu/hita_kyushu_trip_report/
"I wouldn’t go as far as to say it’s worth taking a 4-hour train ride just for Hita. However, if you’re already in the area and the weather is nice, it could be worth stopping by on the way, or even spending a night there if you enjoy quieter and more peaceful places. The two restaurants we went to were very local and incredibly cheap.",comment_3,r/JapanTravel,Travel,,https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/1kt7jdu/hita_kyushu_trip_report/
"That's really cool. Sounds like a great trip! Getting off the western tourist path is very rewarding!

I stayed near Hita just over a year ago, but didn't make it there. So it's worth a visit, if I was to return to the area? Thinking of going back next year.",comment_4,r/JapanTravel,Travel,,https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/1kt7jdu/hita_kyushu_trip_report/
"I went to Onta recently when I was on a Kyushu road trip. It was an hour from Yufuin where I was staying for two days. As it was during Golden Week, I wanted to go somewhere quiet and free from crowds. The pottery village was an eye-opening experience and I would highly recommend it if you are into ceramics and want to see how they have preserved the traditional processes. I did see a bus stop in the village but not sure of the route that it takes. Otherwise, I did see Onta ceramics in places like Yufuin too. 

Have you considered Arita/Saga? Perhaps those would be more accessible via public transport.",comment_5,r/JapanTravel,Travel,,https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/1kt7jdu/hita_kyushu_trip_report/
"2 weeks in Japan So, I traveled to Japan from 27th April to 11th May. Here are highlights of my trip:

*Aomori, Hirosaki, Hakodate, Osaka, Nara, Hiroshima, Miyajima, Kyoto, Tokyo, Kawaguchiko*

27th - landed in Tokyo and took a Shinkansen to Aomori. Checked into hotel and went straight to bed. 

28th - woke up early in the morning and took a train to Hirosaki to attend cherry blossom festival at Hirosaki park. Visited the castle, saw mount iwaki, visited botanical garden, stayed till sunset to watch Sakura trees in the nighttime when they light up the whole park, came back to Aomori

29th - woke up early in the morning, took a Shinkansen to Hakodate. It was raining in Hakodate, visited Goryokaku park, saw more Sakura trees. Shopped at the famous red brick warehouses 

30th - took a flight from Aomori to Osaka. Forwarded luggage to our hotel and headed straight to Nara. Visited Todai ji and the deer park. Came back to Osaka city, had food. Checked into hotel, our luggage had already arrived. Freshened up and went out to Dotonbori area. 

1st - went to Osaka castle. Took a cruise. Chilled a bit. Easy day

2nd - checked out of hotel, locked luggage at the lockers on Osaka station. Took a train to Hiroshima. Visited the peace museum and the a bomb dome. Took a ferry to Miyajima and visited Shinto shrine and the floating tori gate. Headed back to Osaka through Hiroshima. Took out luggage from Osaka station and headed to Kyoto. Checked at hotel in Kyoto pretty late in the night 

3rd - woke up early in the morning and took a walking tour of Kyoto. Visited temples, shrines, pagodas, geisha district, bridges as a part of walking tour. Went to samurai museum (worst possible activity ever) and then ended the day with some Mexican food and sake. 

4th - went to Fushimi inari, Kinkaku-ji, nijo castle, bamboo forest, kinda hectic day. Clocked 30k steps

5th - woke up, checked out of hotel and took a Shinkansen to Tokyo. Thought of stopping at hakone to view Mount Fuji, but it was a cloudy day so went straight to Tokyo. Checked into hotel and explored Akhihabara. 

6th - it rained the whole day so had to find some indoor activities. Headed to Ginza. Shopped at itoya, Muji, Uniqlo and a couple of other shops. 

7th - sunny day. Went to Meiji shrine and the park around it. Checked out few more shops in HARAJUKU area. 

8th - woke up and took a bus to kawaguchiko station. Visited Kawaguchiko lake, took the rope way, but still couldn’t spot Fuji because of clouds. Went to another spot, Saiko, that’s when the clouds started clearing up and we saw top of Fuji. Visited caves, Oishi park etc. and impromptu decided to stay there. Booked an Airbnb and checked into it. Went out in evening to see Fuji more clear. Clicked lot of pictures 

9th - went to Motosuko area. Visited the park where they were celebrating shibazakura festival. Just before leaving, spotted Fuji again. Took a bus back to Tokyo. Visited skytree, had dinner and retired for the night. 

10th - last minute shopping at harajuku, akhihabara, asakusabashi, Shibuya.

11th - packed bags and headed to airport for our flight. Spotted Fuji again from the flight. 

Cherry Blossoms, Iwaki, Fuji, Shinkansen rides, Tori gates, Hiroshima, were the highlights of my trip.",post,r/JapanTravel,Travel,37.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/1ksqgfg/2_weeks_in_japan/

"Sounds like an incredible trip overall — you really covered a lot of ground! I was surprised to see you mention the Samurai Museum as your *worst possible activity ever* though. Mind if I ask what happened? We went to the Kyoto one with our kids and actually had a great time — they loved trying on the armor and doing the sword lessons. It felt more interactive and lighthearted compared to the more formal sights in Kyoto, which helped break up the temple fatigue a bit.

I am in Tokyo now.  And I recommend not doing both team labs.  Some of the major things are at both.  IMO planets was the better and borderless felt a bit meh afterwards.,comment_1,r/JapanTravel,Travel,,https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/1kt8zlw/should_i_save_mount_fuji_for_another_trip_would/
"Overall looks fine. Depends on what you mean by seeing Mt Fuji. You will see it when catching the Shinkansen from Tokyo to Kyoto (and then when going back to Tokyo). For some that may be enough.

Another option is a day trip from Tokyo to Kawaguchiko. If you wanted to you could condense days 2-5 into 3 days which would give you a free day to do this.

Another popular option is an overnight at Hakone but that would need a bit more reshuffling of itinerary.",comment_2,r/JapanTravel,Travel,,https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/1kt8zlw/should_i_save_mount_fuji_for_another_trip_would/
"Day 2 looks great!!. Ps Just past Harajuku is Omotesando - a bit upscale but also cool vibes. For vegetarian lunch I like Mr. Farmer. I also like checking out the nearby Blue Bottle . It’s not a coffee house I go to at home, but I enjoy how Japanese culture embraces & interprets “specialty” food & bev. Same with the  Starbucks restaurant in Ginza",comment_3,r/JapanTravel,Travel,,https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/1kt8zlw/should_i_save_mount_fuji_for_another_trip_would/
"An Alternative is to stay near Akakusa (We stayed at Asakusa View Hotel Annex Rokku) which was very well located.  The area had a great night time vibe and not as crowded as some other places.  There is a direct train from the airport called ""Keisei Sky Access""

There is a Yamato Transport in the area that you can use to forward your luggage to your next hotel

Tokyo National Museum is tricky if you do not read Japanese (well it was when I went).  I really want to see Yayoi Kusama Museum and Sumida Hokusai Museum both of which could be of interest.

Nishiki Market is very commercial.  The Pontocho Alley street next door is full of restaurants including some fancy traditional places.

Some temples will be so packed it is hard to move, some others are near empty. We left Arashiyama out of stress  and went to Ryoanji , if we had gone earlier, I could have had lunch again at Seigeiin on the grounds.

I agree with other commenters.  Just look out the train window on the right hand side about 40 minutes after leaving Tokyo station.  It is usually visible for a good 5 minutes depending on the weather.",comment_4,r/JapanTravel,Travel,,https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/1kt8zlw/should_i_save_mount_fuji_for_another_trip_would/
"Check https://fuji-san.info/en/ when you’re there for the index visibility and you can decide then. 

I’ve just come back and I squeezed a day trip with Fuji Q and Kawaguchiko bike trip around the lake. It was definitely a lot for a day trip (took a train at 6:02 to be there when the park opened), but I’d do it again.

"Day 6 would be wild, if you had to travel from Fukuoka to Hiroshima in the morning. You can get a late Shinkansen from Fukuoka to Hiroshima the night before and stay near the Peace Park. Then, in the morning, check out the park and get the ferry that takes off right there.

Just my two cents, I would cut Hiroshima/Hakone/Himeji and swap it with Nagasaki and do day trips from Fukuoka. You could always take the Shinkansen back to Tokyo and check out Himeji on the way, if you don't fly back.",comment_1,r/JapanTravel,Travel,,https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/1kt4n8h/need_help_with_itinerary_want_to_stay_in_kyushu/
"I feel tired just looking at this itinerary. I'd probably skip Kumamoto. You're probably better off using the day to take Fukuoka in, or leave early to Miyajima to take that in. You need a bit of time just to let it wash over you.

Of Hakone and Himeji, I'd take Himeji on that itinerary. Half a day and a night in Hakone after coming from Hiroshima and flying out the next day sounds rough.",comment_2,r/JapanTravel,Travel,,https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/1kt4n8h/need_help_with_itinerary_want_to_stay_in_kyushu/

"Help me choose - Kanazawa vs Old Nakaserdo Trail I will be visiting Japan for the first time this summer on a solo three week trip. I caught a bad case of mission creep and am now trying to remove locations / activities in order to better enjoy my time in the country. One thing that was removed was an overnight stay in Magome, and then hiking the Old Nakaserdo Trail to Nagiso followed by a train to Tokyo. I may be able to salvage this, but that would require skipping Kanazawa. Would the community be able to share their thoughts and recommendations? It really comes down to seeing the garden firefly event at night vs hiking a historical trail

Of note: I will have spent 2 nights in Miyajima, 5 nights in Kyoto, and 3 nights in Hokkaido prior to this (2 nights in Lake Koya and 1 night in Sapporo); After the below, I will be hiking Mt Fuji, spending 2 nights in Hakone, and 3 nights in Tokyo (one full day in Tokyo will be a day trip Nagoya for a Sumo tournament)

**Original Itinerary**

* **Day 11 - Afternoon flight from Sapporo to Kanazawa**
   * Firefly event at Kenroku-en
* **Day 12 - Kanazawa**
   * Explore more gardens
   * Visit the Samurai and geisha districts
   * Possibly the ninja temple and museum
* **Day 13 - Kanazawa to Takayama**
   * Bus (3ish hours) from Kanazawa to Takyama
   * Vist the Hida na sato
   * Historic district for sake
* **Day 14 - Takayama to Tokyo**
   * Morning market
   * Explore the historic district
   * \~5ish hour commute to Tokyo... (I was originally going take a 5 hour journey to Magome, spend the night, and then hike / go to Tokyo the following day)

**Alternative Itinerary**

* **Day 11** **- Late afternoon flight from Sapporo to Nagoya**
   * This would be more expensive than my current flight to Kanazawa and I would have to pay \~$50 in ANA cancellation fees
* **Day 12 - Nagoya** (I cannot combine this idea with the Sumo tournament due to my travel dates)
   * Day trip to Magome / Nagiso - Early morning train + bus to Magome, hike 4 hours, train back from Nagiso
* **Day 13 - Nagoya to Takayama**
   * Early morning train to Takayama (the commute time is similiar to that from Kanazawa
   * Visit Hida na Sato
   * Historic district for Sake
* **Day 14 - Takayama to Tokyo**
   * Morning market
   * Explore the historic district
   * \~5 hour commute from Tokyo",post,r/JapanTravel,Travel,3.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/1kt0epz/help_me_choose_kanazawa_vs_old_nakaserdo_trail/
"I am currently in Tokyo, just got here after doing the Nakasendo on foot, from Nakatsugawa to Magome, Magome to Tsumago, Tsumago to Nagiso. 

I loved it. The hikes are great. The scenery is beautiful. Magome is the nicest town. I stayed there overnight, and it's a place I'll always remember. 

If you don't like hiking and are intending to take the bus, maybe it's not worth it. But the waterfalls along the way, the forests, the tea houses on the trail, the gardens, to me, made it an amazing couple of days.

there are a lot gardens in kyoto and in japan if you think about it

"Trip Report - 18 days between Osaka and Tokyo This is a report of my third trip to Japan, with a return to Osaka after two years, as well as various day trips from Tokyo and a whole bunch of events around Golden Week.



**Day 1 - April 21: Arrival.**

Flight to Japan, landed in Osaka on 21st of April in the early evening. Took a moment to get my bearings, swap out my simcard, get some Yen from the 7-11 ATM and travel to my hostel in Osaka for some much needed sleep.

 

**Day 2 - April 22: Kyoto**

Got some breakfast followed by a trip to Kyoto, picking up my 14 day JR pass at Kyoto station to be active from the next day.

After that was a trip to Arashiyama Bamboo Forest, followed by a walk from there to Arashiyama park for the Ho-oh manhole cover. A trio of local ladies with the same idea even helped with taking pictures!

Next was a relaxing walk alongside the Katsura river to Nishikyogoku, followed be a trip to the other side of Kyoto for the Ryozen Museum of History. A museum well worth visiting! The day was finished by a return to Osaka for dinner and a bar event hosted by a local idol.

 

**Day 3 - April 23: Hiroshima**

A journey to Hiroshima for a visit to Shukkeien Garden, the ruins of Hiroshima Castle, and the Peace Memorial Park with associated museums. The evening was filled by the return to Osaka and a birthday event for a member of a local idol group.

 

**Day 4 - April 24: Journey to Tokyo**

A busy day filled by a trip to the Hanazono Rugby Stadium (and Raikou manhole cover), travel to Tokyo by shinkansen, checking in at the hotel in Nishi-kasai, and a quick trip to Shinkiba for the 3rd anniversary show of Prominence (Getting to meet Sera Risa and Kasai Jun was super cool!)

 

**Day 5 - April 25: Aizuwakamatsu**

Woke up early for the journey to Aizuwakamatsu, with a lot of lovely scenery on the way there! Over there I visited the gravesite of the Byakkotai, the Sazaedo Temple, Tsuruga Castle, and had a great Katsudon for lunch. The evening was spent by heading back to Tokyo and watching a stageplay at a theater in Shibuya.

 

**Day 6 - April 26: Yokohama day 1.**

The morning was spent on some shopping, before heading over to Shin-Yokohama for a day of concerts!

 

**Day 7 - April 27: Yokohama day 2.**

The second day in a row that I ended up spending at the Yokohama Arena complex, this time for a wrestling show that ended up effectively eating the entire day. Stardom's All Star Grand Queendom ended up being absolutely worth it though!

 

**Day 8 - April 28: Rest day (Kind of).**

Between relaxing, figuring some things out for the next few days, and a small trip to Nagoya and back, this day flew by.

 

**Day 9 - April 29: Idol events.**

The day opened with an idol event in Minato City. This was followed by another idol event in Shibuya, where I met many of my Japanese friends again and it felt as if I had last seen them the day before rather than a year earlier. The day ended with another idol's birthday event in Ikebukuro.

 

**Day 10 - April 30: Dinosaurs in Fukui.**

Woke up early for the day trip to Fukui for the Fukui Prefectural Dinosaur museum! Absolutely fantastic views on the way there, both in the shinkansen from Tokyo and the local train from Fukui to Katsuyama. The Dinosaur museum alone already made it well worth the effort of visiting, but the various Dinosaur animatronics and images around Fukui station were also cool to see! After a visit to the ruins of Fukui Castle it was time to head back to Tokyo.

 

**Day 11 - May 1: No real plans.**

The eleventh day was spent on a visit to Gotokuji Temple, some shop browsing and a last minute decision to go to a wrestling show at Korakuen Hall.

 

**Day 12 - May 2: Rest and planning.**

The usual breakfast, followed by double-checking the time and financial planning for the next few days. The rest of the day was spent shopping for things like specific Pokémon cards at Akihabara, as well as an idol event in the evening.

 

**Day 13 - May 3: Harajuku-Kasukabe-Harajuku.**

The start of a super busy few days! First a trip to Harajuku for the merch pre-sale of an anniversary concert, followed by a journey to Kasukabe for a wrestling show, in turn followed by a race back to Harajuku to catch the earlier mentioned anniversary concert! After the concert I ended up having dinner with my Japanese friends, which concluded the day.

 

**Day 14 - May 4: Kabukicho and Ikebukuro.**

Went to an idol festival in Kabukicho with my friends, where through some miracle I managed to see and meet everyone I wanted to see and/or meet. This was followed by an event in Ikebukuro where five bands would be performing, and contrary to expectations I managed to catch all five of them! Overall an excellent day, especially as I met a bunch of new people!

 

**Day 15 - May 5: Osaka!**

Another early wake up, this time for a trip to Osaka for an idol event and a wrestling show. After the show and associated merch sales and meet and greets there was time for some dinner before heading back to Tokyo.  



**Day 16 - May 6: The last event.**

Went to Ueno and met up with my friends yet again for an idol's graduation concert, which between the merch pre-sale, the show itself, and the drinking at an izakaya afterwards ate up the entire day.

 

**Day 17 - May 7: The last day.**

The last full day of the trip, I ended up waking up late and spent the day between last minute shopping in Akihabara, relaxing in Ueno park, and repacking my bags for the journey home.

 

**Day 18 - May 8: Flight home.**

Woke up really early, checked out of the hotel, went to Haneda airport by bus and flew home.



**Final thoughts:**

My third trip to Japan ended up being a lot of fun, and the people I met everywhere were just as kind as the previous two trips. Ultimately one of the few ways this trip could have been better, was if I had had a better grasp of the Japanese language. 

Admittedly getting a JR pass for this trip was a bit of a gamble, as I wasn't sure if I'd be able to pull off all of the planned day trips I wanted to do. In the end it worked out perfectly though. 

Another thing that ended up working out perfectly was the travel during Golden Week; contrary to my expectations fed by people's comments, travel during Golden Week ended up being no problem whatsoever. It wasn't all that busy by my standards, though I may have been helped by travelling alone, early, and without luggage.

Perhaps most importantly, I managed to fulfill last year's promise of meeting my Japanese friends again! (Even if I did end up promising it again while we were drinking at an izakaya.) 

Between the photos, the various polaroids, and my daily updated travel logbook of this and the previous trips, I will not forget this trip anytime soon!",post,r/JapanTravel,Travel,8.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/1ksrqcm/trip_report_18_days_between_osaka_and_tokyo/
How was everything during this time this year? Im planning my first trip for april - may of next year and im trying gauge dates.,comment_1,r/JapanTravel,Travel,,https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/1ksrqcm/trip_report_18_days_between_osaka_and_tokyo/
"I'll limit it to a few points:

 Weather overall was excellent this year, mostly cloudy or even sunny with temperatures generally between 15-20 degrees Celsius. I do recall three days with (some) rain while I was in Tokyo, but that does come with the side note that I might have missed other moments of bad weather due to travelling to a different part of the country.

 

When it comes to crowds things were never all that terrible, though I might have missed obvious busy spots and times as a result of my activities.

 

Regarding visiting museums, events and such, I'd strongly recommend at least having an idea of what you want to visit roughly on what day, and figuring out what options you have to secure tickets beforehand. Obviously events and concerts generally require a lot more planning than a museum visit. (Depending on the museum in question, of course! The Nintendo museum is bound to be more busy than the Ryozen museum for example.)

 

I planned to be in Tokyo for the Golden Week portion of this trip on purpose, knowing that there would be plenty of events to choose from just about every day for that period. Any other moments could easily be filled in by other activities. This method is of course not necessarily suitable for everyone.",comment_2,r/JapanTravel,Travel,,https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/1ksrqcm/trip_report_18_days_between_osaka_and_tokyo/

"3rd trip to Japan: itinerary between Osaka-Ise-Nagoya-Atami-Tokyo Hi everyone!

My husband and I are planning our 3rd trip to Japan. During our first visit in May 2023, we did the classic Tokyo-Kyoto-Osaka-Nara route, and also took day trips to Yokohama, Kamakura and Enoshima Island. For our second trip in November 2024, we explored Tokyo, Kawagoe, Fujikawaguchiko, Kanazawa, Takayama, Shirakawa-go, Hiroshima (including Miyajima), Okayama and Kurashiki.

This time, we’ll only have two weeks in Japan (compared to three weeks for the previous ones), and are currently considering the following itinerary:

* Osaka (11-14 December)
   * We’re planning to revisit some of the spots we really enjoyed the first time around: Hozenji Yokocho, Namba Yasaka Shrine, Dōtonbori, Hozen-ji Temple, and probably do a bit of shopping. It'll be quite a relaxed few days.
* Ise (14-16 December)
   * We’ve scheduled two days in Ise to visit Ise Jingū, Okage Yokocho, Futami Okitama Shrine and the Meoto Iwa rocks. It’ll be our first time in the area, so if anyone has any recommendations, we’d love to hear them!
* Nagoya (16-18 December)
   * We initially thought of going to Gifu, but it seemed like there wasn’t too much to do, so we’ve opted for Nagoya instead. That said, we’re not entirely sure about this choice, as we’ve heard it may not be the most exciting city for tourists. 
   * We plan to spend two days there and visit Kōshō-ji, Atsuta Jingū, Sakae, Osu Shotengai Shopping Street, and possibly take a short trip to Inuyama Castle in the afternoon.
* Atami (18-21 December)
   * We’ve heard it’s a charming little seaside town with good access to onsens and a nice introduction to the Izu Peninsula. We plan to spend 3 days in the area:
      * 1 day to relax and explore Atami itself (Itokawa Promenade, Kinomiya Shrine, Kiunkaku), and hopefully find a private onsen where we can unwind (my husband has large tattoos, so any onsen suggestions would be very welcome!);
      * 1 day trip to Itō and the Jogasaki Coast;
      * 1 day trip to Hakone, which we’ve never visited before. We’re a bit hesitant though, as we found Fujikawaguchiko quite crowded and worry Hakone might be similar.
* Tokyo (21-26 December)
   * We’ll finish our trip with five days in Tokyo, mainly for shopping, food tours, relaxing in cafés, and soaking up the city atmosphere.
   * Something we haven’t really done during our previous trips - mostly because we were too tired in the evenings - is go to jazz bars or places with live music. We’d really love to experience that this time, so if you know of any good spots in any of the cities we’ll be visiting, we’d love to hear your recommendations!

We’ve tried to keep this itinerary practical, as we’re not light travellers (we each have a large suitcase), and prefer travelling by train rather than bus. We also don’t have a driving licence, so renting a car isn’t an option.

If you have any suggestions for things to see or do, local experiences, or possible day trips from these places - or improvements to our itinerary - we’d be really grateful. Thanks in advance for your ideas!",post,r/JapanTravel,Travel,3.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/1ksvmw7/3rd_trip_to_japan_itinerary_between/
"Nagoya gets too much hate imo. There's enough stuff to do to occupy 2 days, and there's barely any tourists there, which is a plus imo.",comment_1,r/JapanTravel,Travel,,https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/1ksvmw7/3rd_trip_to_japan_itinerary_between/
"I would recommend only one day in Ise, but go with a guide. The shrine is beautiful, but really comes to life when you have a guide to explain the history/mythology to you. I would also do it as a day trip from Nagoya rather than going there straight from Osaka.

With another day in Nagoya, you'll have more time for day trips around the region (of which there are many). You can head into Gifu for Shirakawago/Takayama, or into Shiga to see Hikone/OmiHachiman, or check out some lesser known places like Nishio or Seki.

Nagoya is so underrated and is the perfect place to act as a ""home base"" to take day trips from in my opinion.",comment_2,r/JapanTravel,Travel,,https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/1ksvmw7/3rd_trip_to_japan_itinerary_between/
Hakone is definitely worth the visit. I was there last Summer and it was fairly crowded but everything was handled perfectly. Expect a few lines to get on public transport.,comment_3,r/JapanTravel,Travel,,https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/1ksvmw7/3rd_trip_to_japan_itinerary_between/
"A few thoughts: 

***Ise:*** 

As u/Naaaasabenya said, you can do the things you want to do in Ise in a single day and it makes more sense to do it as a day trip from Nagoya, as it is closer than Osaka. 

***Nagoya:*** 

Nagoya is a pleasant, albeit industrial, city and there are plenty of things to do around Nagoya. Here's what I've previously commented about Nagoya: 

*Nagoya has Atsuta-jingu, one of the most important Shinto shrines that (apparently) contains one of the Imperial family’s three sacred treasures.*

*If you’re interested in technology and engineering, there’s the Toyota Commemorative Museum of Industry and Technology. There is also an excellent JR railway museum, which includes shinkansen and the experimental maglev train.*

[*https://www.japan-guide.com/e/e2155.html*](https://www.japan-guide.com/e/e2155.html)

*Also, there’s quite a bit to do in the area around Nagoya.*

* *Inuyama - A town near Nagoya, home to one of Japan’s oldest original castles perched above the river, with great views. Also has cormorant fishing on the river and some nearby sites associated with the Momotaro legend. It’s a really nice outing from Nagoya.*
* *Meiji-mura - Near Inuyama, an architectural museum with historic buildings from around Japan that have been moved there. Includes the facade and foyer of the old Imperial Hotel in Tokyo designed by Frank Lloyd Wright. You can do Inuyama and Meiji-mura in the one day.*
* *Ise Jingu - One of the most significant Shinto shrines in Japan. You can’t see much of the inner shrine, but you can walk through the forest and look at the outer shrine area and buildings near the entrance to the complex.*

*Japan Guide article on Nagoya City:* [*https://www.japan-guide.com/e/e2155.html*](https://www.japan-guide.com/e/e2155.html)

*Article with some suggestions on things to do and see around Nagoya:* [*https://www.japan-guide.com/ad/central-japan/201126.html*](https://www.japan-guide.com/ad/central-japan/201126.html)

You mentioned going to Inuyama and I would highly recommend it. I really like Inuyama-jo (castle) and Meiji-mura. 

***Atami:***

Atami itself isn't really a ""charming little seaside town"". It's filled with lots of concrete buildings erected during the boom days of the 1970s and 1980s and quite a few of them are looking less than ideal nowadays. It does have a beach, but the beaches further south are nicer. However, Kinomiya-jinja is really lovely and well worth visiting. The two shotengai (shopping streets) next to Atami station are also great, with lots of nice little shops, cafes and restaurants. There's also a great, retro kissaten (coffee shop) upstairs directly opposite the train station. 

Further south of Atami, places like Omuroyama and the Jogasaki coast are well worth visiting and we loved our time spent travelling down the Izu Peninsula. There's a fantastic little restaurant in the chairlift building hidden behind a door at the base of Omuroyama.",comment_4,r/JapanTravel,Travel,,https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/1ksvmw7/3rd_trip_to_japan_itinerary_between/
"You can dive in the Ito area with East Dive (they have English speaking staff). I think there’s a hammerhead shark diving spot off Shimoda, but that’s probably a Japanese speaking operator.",comment_5,r/JapanTravel,Travel,,https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/1ksvmw7/3rd_trip_to_japan_itinerary_between/

"You haven’t specified how many people are in your family or the age of your kid(s), but with a night arrival, large luggage, and at least one kid, a private transfer is probably your best option — it’s not cheap (a quick estimate says \~$150 USD), but it’s by far the easiest. (Taxis are a similar option, but depending on the number of people/size of luggage, you might not all fit into a regular taxi).

If you have 2 or more kids under the age of 10, I wouldn’t consider public transportation unless you‘re really strapped for cash. If they’re older and/or you just have one, the trains are an option, but keep in mind you will all be exhausted and it could be stressful.",comment_4,r/JapanTravel,Travel,,https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/1kte4ci/transport_from_narita_to_disney_resort/

"~2 week Tokyo trip write up For context this is my second trip to Japan but my first ever time in Tokyo! I visited both Kyoto and Osaka for a 2 week trip back in 2019. I wanted to allot more time in Tokyo specifically since I’ve never been and there’s such a large volume of things to do in this city that I wanted to see it all. 

One thing I do regret deeply is my itinerary was SO packed. I just wanted to do and see everything and as a result I felt like I was hopping from place to place without a lot of breathing room. I did have days where I wandered and explored at my own pace but some days were running like a chicken with its head cut off. I’m still overall very happy with how everything turned out, but just some wisdom I wanted to pass on. 

I also want to preface that my preferences will not be the same as yours! I care a lot about soaking up big city vibes, POKEMON, anime merch, character goods, food, photos, shopping. Yes I like temples and nature but those things aren’t as important to me as the first few things. I definitely wish I took at least 1-2 more day trips though. Or heck even a rest day. But no rest for the wicked! 

Anyways, this was my itinerary: 

5/9: Leave home, fly to Tokyo

5/10: Land at Narita, take Skyliner to Ueno. I found myself wandering through Ameyoko market late at night and stumbling into a delicious local ramen joint. Got some oysters too! Walked around a bit more and soaked in the night life. It was Saturday night. A lot of young people at the izakaya having drinks. 

5/11: Ventured out to Akihabara and shopped around the various anime stores. I remember being shocked by just how many floors each store has! Got a lot of gacha keychains, blind boxes, and anime figurines! There was also a matsuri going on with people carrying mikoshi, chanting, drumming, cheering etc. Good times.

5/12: The pace picked up a bit more this day. Woke up early, took advantage of my jet lag and headed to Tsukiji Fish Market. Tried the tamago, tuna sashimi (melt in your mouth), wagyu skewer (favorite thing I ate), gyudon, oyster, scallops, matcha.. WOW! Then went to Ginza and shopped at Uniqlo and Muji. Got udon. Made our way to Senso-Ji/Asakusa. 

5/13: Meiji Temple in the morning. Spent a lot of time here, wandering through the grounds and hiking through the gardens. Then Shibuya for afternoon/evening. Walked the crossing. Don Quixote. I checked out the Pokemon Center, Nintendo Store, Shonen Jump store at Parco. Then Tower Records! Tried Ichiran just to say I tried it. It was mid. 

5/14: Wandered around the Tokyo Tower area and discovered Maple Waterfall Park! Gorgeous little green space and it was so early that I basically had it to myself. Went to a cafe. Spent the afternoon bumming around Akihabara and Ueno. Strolled through Ueno Park and stumbled across the cutest summer flea market! Picked up very cheap ceramic kitchenware (550 yen a bowl) and some wooden spoons. Had my mind BLOWN at the Tokyo National Museum. Spent a few hours here but wish I had more time. Then went back to accommodation to watch some of the XG concert livestream.

5/15: Mt. Fuji day trip. Literally the HIGHLIGHT of my trip. We got extremely lucky with the visibility so Fujisan looked absolutely beautiful. Stopped at Oshino Hakkai and tried houtou noodles and it was absolutely scrumptious! Took pictures at Lawson. Wandered around little streets in the village nearby. Went to Lake Kawaguchi. Took the cable car up to a viewing point. Saw some swans and fish at another lake area. 

Once I got back to Tokyo I saw LiSA in concert! It was my very first Japanese concert so the etiquette was TOTALLY different but I adjusted very quickly. She was absolutely amazing. Then I just bummed around Shinjuku after the concert lol. 

5/16: Ikebukuro day! Spent a lot of today ambling around Sunshine City and various doujinshi/BL stores lol. Dropped by Pokemon Center Ikebukuro. This area definitely has a different vibe than Akihabara. Went to TeamLabs which I thought was overall quite a mid experience. Then made my way back to accommodation and on the way back saw the Miyazaki clock! WOW! 

5/17: DISNEY SEA DAY! I got there a few hours before opening and bolted to Fantasy Springs area. Got to do the Peter Pan, Rapunzel, and Tinkerbell rides. Frozen was closed. Did Journey, 20k Leagues, Soaring, Indiana Jones, and Nemo rides too! At the end of the day I was so exhausted. It was also POURING rain that day.

5/18: This day was kind of crazy, so buckle up. Woke up at dawn and immediately bolted to the Your Name stairs. What’s insane is there were already a few people taking pictures! But it was overall very serene and quiet. I checked out the Suga Shrine right next to it. Hit up a vending machine and just vibed. Then I made the stupid but also chaotic decision to WALK to the Imperial Palace. So I did. Hit up a konbini for a cold drink and just… walked and walked. I feel like I saw a lot of quieter neighborhoods this way too. The Imperial Palace gardens were… meh. I liked the koi fish and cool twisty trees though. 

You’d think the day is wrapping up but we are just getting started. Ambled over to Tokyo Station to explore Character Street. Went to the Pokemon Center Tokyo DX. Chilled a bit at a cafe. 

Not done yet! Then I took the train ALL the way to Shimokitazawa. Had to transfer through Shibuya so I stood and watched the crossing. Ducked into a few vintage clothing stores, nothing really piqued my interest. Then back to Shinjuku to watch Godzilla do its thing. Ended the day at Golden Gai and befriended a local! 

5/19: This day was also quite insane. I think as the days went on and I realized my trip was ending soon I wanted to do EVERYTHING. Got breakfast with some friends I haven’t seen since college. Smoothies at 7-11 and walked around. Went to Dengama in the kitchenware district. Shibuya Sky. Then went to my Pokemon cafe reservation. Got dinner with a different group of friends. Won some plushies at the arcade. And then finally a private onsen to end the night. 

5/20: Last day. Went to Tokyo Tower again and looked around the mall/shopping area attached to it. Took some final pictures. Then went to Narita for flight home. Got some curry. Hit up a couple souvenir shops. Then goodbye Japan!",post,r/JapanTravel,Travel,42.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/1ksavga/2_week_tokyo_trip_write_up/

"Hiroshima->Okayama(Castle+Korakuen)->Himeji(Castle+Kokoen)->Kobe Itinerary? I am looking to plan my second trip to Japan. I am traveling with one other, and we are no stranger to 25k+ step days.

"Now... I have some suggestions for Okayama in a couple of areas.

First, if you are interested in Japanese cityscapes, as others have suggested, you should visit the [Bikan district](https://www.kurashiki-tabi.jp/standard/kurashiki-bikan-historical-quarter/) in Kurashiki. It is a well-developed tourist area and you can enjoy shopping for fashion and crafts.

If you are a Samurai admirer, you may want to visit Bizen. This is the city of traditional Bizen pottery and swords. The [Sword Museum](https://www.city.setouchi.lg.jp/site/token/) is famous. If you are lucky, you will be able to see sword smiths at work in person.

If you are interested in paintings, the Takehisa Yumeji Museum is located next to Korakuen Garden. [Yumeji](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yumeji_Takehisa)(1884-1934) is a modernist painter of the Taisho era, he designed many advertisements and posters in addition to his paintings. His paintings also had a great influence on shoujo manga (girls' manga).

If you are interested in gourmet food, the most recommended food is fruit. Peaches, grapes, olives, and lemons are especially famous.

Interested in myths, legends, and ancient history? [Kibitsuhiko-Jinja](https://www.kibitsuhiko.or.jp/) is dedicated to a prince Kibitsuhiko from a time when mythology was still a part of the land. He is said to be the model for Momotaro, Japan's most famous fairy tale hero. And in [Kibi-ji](https://www.net-japan.info/kibiji/), many ancient tombs and Buddhist architecture coexist. There are few private houses around, and on a clear day, visitors can enjoy the beautiful scenery of nature and Buddhist temples.

The biggest problem is that these locations are quite far apart. It is impossible to visit them all in one day.",comment_3,r/JapanTravel,Travel,,https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/1ksrvhw/hiroshimaokayamacastlekorakuenhimejicastlekokoenko/

"My trip report: Tokyo, Osaka, Kyoto Reflections on My Trip to Japan

Visiting Japan was an unforgettable experience, full of cultural contrasts and unique moments. Overall, I had a good time, though not without a few gripes. Here’s a breakdown of what stood out to me—both the highlights and the not-so-great parts.

What I Loved:
	•	The people: While generally shy, the locals were incredibly kind once you engaged with them. There’s a quiet warmth and hospitality that’s hard to find elsewhere.
	•	Respect culture: I genuinely admired the bowing, the attention to detail, and the small rituals—like handing you items with both hands—that reflect deep-rooted respect and pride in one’s work.
	•	Cultural uniqueness: Japan has a distinct, fascinating identity. Everything—from food to etiquette—feels uniquely Japanese, and I appreciated that.
	•	No tipping: The lack of a tipping culture is refreshing. Service is excellent, and there are no expectations or awkward calculations at the end of a meal.
	•	Cleanliness: The sidewalks are spotless, and there’s an evident sense of public responsibility and care.
	•	Transportation: The train system is incredibly efficient, clean, and easy to navigate. Easily one of the best in the world.

What I Didn’t Love:
	•	Rodent issues: Both Tokyo and Osaka seem to have a noticeable rat problem in certain areas, especially at night.
	•	Bar scene: Many bars are tiny and charge cover fees, which makes bar-hopping difficult and uninviting. The vibe felt more closed-off than fun.
	•	Tourist traps: Areas like Shinjuku and Shibuya are full of overpriced spots. I had meals where I spent $200 on sushi that didn’t even compare to what I can get back home.
	•	Trash situation: I respect the cultural norm of not eating or drinking while walking, but finding a trash can afterward is surprisingly difficult. Carrying a backpack full of wrappers and bottles gets old fast.
	•	Table charges & “free” dishes: Those mandatory small plates (usually billed as a cover charge) were universally bland. Cold beans and sesame seeds? Hard pass.
	•	Floor seating: I know it’s traditional, but sitting on the floor crushed my lower back. A heads-up or option to sit at the bar would’ve gone a long way—especially for bigger travelers.
	•	Entertainment outside food/drink: Beyond eating, drinking, and sightseeing, I found entertainment options pretty limited. There weren’t many shows, performances, or live events that caught my eye.
	•	Pachinko: A total mystery and money pit. I dropped $100 trying to figure it out, hit what I thought was a jackpot, and still didn’t win—apparently I was supposed to turn a knob at the right moment? There are no clear instructions, and everything’s in Japanese. Felt like a tourist trap.
	•	Cosplay culture: I don’t mean any offense here, but the sudden visual switch from salarymen to young adults dressed in full anime cosplay was jarring. It’s just… a lot. That said, the people-watching is top-tier.

Final Thoughts:

Japan was fascinating, beautiful, and at times frustrating. I’m glad I went, and I’ll carry the memories with me—but I’m not sure I feel the need to return anytime soon. The 13 hour flight was a bit much.",post,r/JapanTravel,Travel,0.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/1kte0g3/my_trip_report_tokyo_osaka_kyoto/
"""Areas like Shinjuku and Shibuya are full of overpriced spots. I had meals where I spent $200 on sushi ...""  
I mean, going to touristy spots to eat out is also a ripoff elsewhere. It's a bit naive to think otherwise imho.  
  
""Trash situation: ... but finding a trash can afterward is surprisingly difficult. Carrying a backpack full of wrappers and bottles gets old fast.""  
Sorry, but I REALLY don't get that.  
What is so difficult about taking your own trash along?  
Full backpack?! I always had a little plastic bag for trash and it was always plenty enough until I got to the next konbini or hotel room.  
I LOVE the fact that Japan ISN'T littered with trash cans every 20m. And apart from very touristy areas (that seemingly can't carry their trash for more than 5m), it's still perfectly clean. So clearly it's something that isn't hard and is only something some foreigners can't seem to do.

""Pachinko: A total mystery and money pit. I dropped $100 trying to figure it out ... There are no clear instructions, and everything’s in Japanese. Felt like a tourist trap""  
Not really a tourist trap. They don't expect foreigners at all. Because, yes, it is a money pit. Like all of gambling.  
I honestly never saw a foreigner in there. Just sad old Japanese men.

"I gotta say some of your negative points are crazy to me; you went to Pachinko parlor, a place for gambling, don't speak any Japanese and lost money, what were you expecting? If you think there's limited entertainment options in the largest city on earth, it's likely because you didn't know where or how to look. I would suggest guided tours to help you in this aspect.

Lastly and very importantly to me, you said you love the cleanliness, but hating carrying your trash around. These are the two sides of the coin, if you want things to be clean and nice, everyone must participate and take responsibility for their mess.

Also there's trash bins in every convenience store in the country.",comment_4,r/JapanTravel,Travel,,https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/1kte0g3/my_trip_report_tokyo_osaka_kyoto/

Have flights already been made? Reason I ask is. Why not fly into KIX, fly out of HND? You’ll save a two hour bullet train ride",comment_3,r/JapanTravel,Travel,,https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/1kt82ni/help_us_plan_our_dream_japan_anniversary_trip/
"You're forgetting to allow for fatigue and jet lag - you will be totally wrecked by the time you arrive at Osaka, so just go to bed. I doubt you'll be wanting to go on cruises the next night either.

You don't need to take a special train to Nara or the Shinkansen from Osaka to Kyoto - the regular JR trains will be the cheapest and quickest options.

I'm also very doubtful that flying into Haneda, getting public transport into central Tokyo, a Shinkansen to Shin-Osaka and then the Osaka subway to your hotel would be faster than just flying from Haneda to KIX and then getting a train into the city. Remember again that you'll be smashed by jet lag, so flying will be simpler as you won't need to faff about with unfamiliar train systems - remember to allow a healthy allowance to the Google Maps travel time estimates for the time it will take you to find your way around train stations, etc (I've been through Tokyo Station about 6 times, and gotten totally lost each time).",comment_4,r/JapanTravel,Travel,,https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/1kt82ni/help_us_plan_our_dream_japan_anniversary_trip/
"Please for your own sanity, don't go in early to mid July. I grew up in Florida going to Orlando in July. I thought I could handle it, but doing Kyoto in heat index of 100 to 112 F, looking at 1200 year old monuments which obviously don't have AC was miserable. If you absolutely must go in August, I would highly recommend making the most of Osaka's underground tunnels and malls associated to their subway system. Likewise in Tokyo, I would focus on staying in the various malls and arcades that are climate controlled.

Markets like Tsukiji are huge tourist traps with massive up charges on the food. You can find better ones in places like Kanazawa and Kobe. 

You probably won't find much of the traditional rural Japan culture on the golden route. I would consider staying in a Ryokan in an onsen town to experience bath culture. Obviously because of the heat, you would be better off in the Japanese Alps in places like Shibu Onsen in Nagano or Kusatsu Onsen in Gunma but those are like 1-2 hrs north of Tokyo. You can also experience rural Japan in places like the Koyasan temple complex in Wakayama 1-2 hours south of Kyoto and Osaka or in Shizuoka, the halfway point between Kansai region and Tokyo. Kurama and Kibune at the end of Kyoto's metro system are also super nice and higher altitude to avoid the heat. Kyoto locals do that frequently since it's also way less touristy to the extent that some restaurants even refuse to let foreigners in.

Hiking some of the Nakasendo trail, the historic route between Tokyo and Kyoto will show you some traditional Japan and pop you out by Matsumoto in Nagano which has a really cool castle if you don't visit Osaka or Himeji castle in Kansai. 

Trains are tricky. I would genuinely be surprised if flying in to Tokyo then taking bullet trains to Osaka would be cheaper then flying into Osaka and one waying to Tokyo. Bullet train tickets cost as much as flights, and you're better off on local trains between places like Osaka and Kyoto even though they take marginally longer since they only cost like $10.",comment_5,r/JapanTravel,Travel,,https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/1kt82ni/help_us_plan_our_dream_japan_anniversary_trip/

"Okinomiyaki, do it in Hiroshima.

I would make day 4 in a trip to Koya San and stay in a temple. Currently you have a lot of super touristy stuff on that day.
Day 5 is super packed. Better to split it between 5 and 6 and enjoy the afternoon in a onzen.
That way you have a better trip at day 7 luggage in trains in Japan is a big no no. And with the luggage service you don't need to go to the hotel but you can go straight into the city. While your luggage is waiting at check-in.
Day 8 I would go to Nara and to Inari on the way back. Different train but stops right in front.

Would go to teamlabs borderless instead of planets. 

My best advise, use the luggage services everywhere. If you need to ship your bags a day before make a small day pack with the stuff you need. This will save you so much time and add almost 2 full days of time to your trip plus the whole train travel will be a breeze. You will be laughing at all tourists carrying those big suitcases around.",comment_4,r/JapanTravel,Travel,,https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/1ksqfst/thoughts_on_this_2week_itinerary_is_it_realistic/

"Trip Report: 9 Day Japan Honeymoon Hello, everyone! My husband and I recently returned from a 9-day honeymoon holiday in Japan.  I found these trip reports and itineraries helpful in planning our trip, so I wanted to share our own experiences with you fellow travelers! This was our first time in Japan; we flew into and out of Tokyo Narita Airport and stayed in Tokyo and Kyoto, with a day trip to Osaka.

Our itinerary:

Day 0 | Travel Day

We flew 15 hours directly from our hometown to Narita, losing a day in the process. This flight was pretty brutal - if yours is as long as ours, bring plenty of snacks and entertainment. 

Day 1 | Arrival in Tokyo

Since we were staying in Ueno, we prebooked Narita Skyliner Express tickets on Klook. It was super easy to hop on, and there was space for our luggage. We checked into our hotel, freshened up, and then went on a Ueno food and drinks tour. We had a great time trying things we wouldn't have otherwise ordered (think pickled plums, chicken esophagus, and whiskey highballs). 

Day 2 | Explore Tokyo: Ueno, Yanaka, Nippori, Asakusa, and Akihabara

We started off the day with a hotel breakfast then wandered some of Tokyo's quieter neighborhoods for the morning. I love to sew, so I spent quite a bit of time in Nippori's fabric town. After visiting Senso-ji temple and grabbing *Okonomiyaki* in Asakusa, we took a brief nap back at our hotel before exploring Akihabara's electric city. I won't lie - Asakusa and Akihabara were tough due to the crowds. We really enjoyed Yanaka and Nippori though! 

Day 3 | Explore Tokyo: Shinjuku, Harajuku, and Shibuya

We started today with a visit to the Metropolitan Government building to see the great views then bopped over to the Sompo Insurance Museum to see Van Gogh's sunflowers (my favorite painting) before heading to Harajuku where we explored Yoyogi Park, Meiji Jingu, and Takeshita Street before grabbing lunch at Kura Sushi. We have a Kura at home, so it was fun to compare the experience! We then do a kintsuki pottery workshop in Harajuku before heading to Shibuya to experience to famous crosswalk and see the Nintendo store and Pokemon Center. Shibuya was also very crowded but wasn't quite as overwhelming as Akihabara (I think because there's more room to breathe). After a ramen dinner, we headed back to the hotel. 

Day 4 | Tokyo Disney Sea

This was the day we were most intimidated by, but it ended up being one of the most pleasant of our trip! We waited in line for about 30 minutes before opening and experienced all of the rides we wanted to see. We lost the lottery to see the big band performance but otherwise enjoyed exploring, riding rides, and trying all the snacks we wanted. My favorite was the soy sauce popcorn! I also liked looking at the merch - I snagged a couple of Duffy items for our nieces and nephews back home, since they're not available in the States. 

Day 5 | Tokyo --> Kyoto

Today we grabbed our last hotel breakfast and boarded the *shinkansen* for Kyoto. Like the rest of Japanese public transit, it was super easy to link our pre-booked tickets to our IC cards and hop on. We prebooked seats in the oversized baggage area to stash away our suitcases. We grabbed some bento boxes from Ueno station before boarding, and we even saw Mt. Fuji along our way! 

Once we checked into our room at a traditional ryokan, we temple-hopped and explored Gion. We started at Kiyomizu-dera and worked our way up Ninenzaka to Yasaka, visiting all the little shrines and shops that caught our attention along the way. Crowds were pretty brutal, but that's what we expected for the afternoon. Once we got our fill of temples, we participated in a traditional tea ceremony where we dressed up in traditional kimono and took lots of photos. Then, we bopped to Nishiki Market and grabbed street food for dinner before going back to enjoy the onsen at our ryokan. Tbh, the little taco stand outside of Nishiki Market was one of my favorite meals! 

Day 6 | Explore Kyoto: Arashiyama

We began with a traditional Japanese breakfast at our ryokan before heading over to see the famous bamboo grove and Okochi Sanso Gardens. The bamboo grove was already popping by 9am with wannabe photographers, but the gardens were blissfully empty save us and 1-2 other couples. We then took the Sagano romance train up and a Katsura river boat ride back down. Both were fun and offered great views!

After this, we took a taxi to Kinkaku-ji to see the lovely golden pavilion and grabbed a delicious eel dinner nearby before turning in early to our ryokan. 

Day 7 | Osaka Day Trip

We really lucked out on weather, because today was the only day it really rained, and we had planned on being mostly indoors anyways. We took the train to Osaka, visited the Castle museum, grabbed an incredible soba + tempura lunch, then headed to the Aquarium where we were greeted by the incredible whale shark. I think we stood there watching them for at least 45 minutes. We then made our way to Dotonbori to try more street foods and people watch. 

Today was probably our most crowded/stressful day with all of the commuting across Osaka, but I was glad we got to see what we did! We took the train back to Kyoto, stopping by Fushimi Inari on our way to see the famous red tori gates at night. We happened to stumble across a mama wild boar and her babies, so be careful if you go late to avoid crowds!

Day 8 | Kyoto --> Tokyo

We enjoyed a tea ceremony at our ryokan before catching the shinkansen back to Tokyo. Once we checked into our final hotel, we headed to Ginza to shop for souvenirs and eat some delicious bougie sushi.  For our last night, we balled out and got a room at the Imperial Hotel overlooking the imperial palace and ate wagyu with champagne at one of their many restaurants. It was so delicious and very fun since we had the place to ourselves - there was even a live pianist!

Day 9 | Last day in Tokyo!

Our flight was at 5pm, so we spent the morning enjoying the nearby palace gardens and grabbed a last lunch at Tsukiji Outer Market before making our way back to Ueno to board the Narita Express again.



**Highlights of the Trip:**

\- Our fantastic ryokan in Kyoto

\- Nippori fabric town

\- Harajuku (I liked Takeshita Street way more than I thought I would)

\- Tokyo DisneySea



**Lowlights:**

\- Osaka wasn't my cup of tea, but I'm still glad we went!

\- Crowds in tourist areas (not surprising, since we are tourists, after all)

\- General feeling of stress navigating public transit if you're not used to it (we are from a car-centric city and only use public transit when we travel. Thankfully, Japan's metro and bus system is pretty easy to get the hang of, but there were several moments when we got overwhelmed!)

  
The next time we visit Japan, we'd likely stay the entire time in Tokyo and do more day trips to places we wished we had visited, like Nikko, Kamakura, and Hakone. Overall, we had a lovely time, and I wish you all the best in planning your own trips to Japan! It was a great honeymoon, and we can't wait to go back as soon as we can!",post,r/JapanTravel,Travel,20.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/1ks6eh9/trip_report_9_day_japan_honeymoon/

"My first trip to Japan - 12 days - not a shopper I'm going to Japan at the end of next month! It's a last minute trip and I will be joining my sister-in-law, who grew up there, for a portion of the time.  (She takes my niece and nephew to her hometown each summer to visit family and attend the local elementary school.)

My itinerary is bare bones because I don't like to over plan.  I am really not a shopper, but I enjoy visiting historical and cultural sites and nature. I would like to take a cooking or art class... any suggestions would be greatly appreciated! 

Day 0-3: Tokyo 

* I'll be at the airport for a few hours before my family, so I'll buy my Suica card.
* Sister-in-law will take me and the kids sight-seeing. (Asakusa, Shibuya, Ueno Park)
* We have tickets to Teamlabs Planets

Day 4: Train to sister-in-law's village in Shimada

Day 5: Spend time on extended family's ranch, visit the river, hang out with the kids

Day 6: Train to Kinosaki (remainder of trip is solo)

* Say goodbye to family and continue solo to Kinosaki
* Planning to make the express train that arrives around 4pm
* Check into guesthouse
* Walk around town, relax in onsen for a few hours 

Day 7: Kinosaki

* Morning: Take ropeway to shrine and hike
* Afternoon: Considering renting a bike and exploring surrounding area
* Evening: visit Onsen again

Day 8: Train to Kyoto

* Arrive by 3p to check in at hotel (near station) and drop off luggage
* Evening tour of Fushimi Inari

Day 9: Day trip to Hiroshima

* Free walking tour at Hiroshima memorial Park
* Visit the famous Shinto Shrine / Tori Gate

Day 10: Kyoto

* Early Morning: Monkey Park
* Late Afternoon: Visit Gion district
* Souvenir shopping? 

Day 11: Day trip to Nara

* Visit a museum, explore, eat some food
* Deer Park
* Giant Buddha

Day 12: Depart

* Take train from Kyoto back to Tokyo to make 5pm flight.

**My Main worry:**    I will be solo for the last portion of my trip and this will be the first time I've travelled to a country solo where I don't know the language. Will I get lost on the trains? Seems overwhelming--*regional, local, express, highspeed, basic fare, different machines for different ticket types....* oh my!!  I have an Android and based on recommendations on this sub I've downloaded the Smartex app, the Navitime app, and I plan to but a Welcome Suica? card when I arrive at the airport...though I don't know if I require ALL three of these things.

We rented a pocket wifi on our first trip as we didn't want to incur roaming fees. That and Google maps and Google translate were enough to get us by on our first trip.

Do Inari on the way back from Nara. It saves you a lot of time and an extra day.,comment_2,r/JapanTravel,Travel,,https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/1krytr2/my_first_trip_to_japan_12_days_not_a_shopper/
"I've been to Japan multiple times, and T-mobile basic international plan 2G is absolute garbage. It loads so slow, and there's a bunch of gray areas where you don't even get a signal. I would not rely on this. This is just not in Japan but in Hong Kong and China as well.

Since it's your first trip, I'd recommend getting an esim. You don't have to carry a pocket wifi, and it's pretty affordable. Look on Trip, search for Japan Esim, you'll see this 

""Japan SoftBank Docomo eSIM Day Pass / Data Package | 1-30 ...

4.7/5 3.4k reviews 79.7k booked""

For 12 days you get 5G speed and 1G per day, it's about $7.00

I'd pay that price for peace of mind throughout the entire trip. There is no need to look around for wifi here and there. You can browse on your phone during the shinkansen rides and look up local restaurants in the local area.

Don't be like me during the first trip standing in the corner for 10-30 minutes for my 2G to load back in 2015. 


Huge waste of time.. never again, esim all the way.

Edit - I was recently in Tokyo for a long layover back in Oct 2024. My 2G barely loaded from HND airport to Ikebukuro station. Bought an esim immediately for a dollar for two days.

Especially tips on avoiding crowds, making the most of the beaches, and any great food spots or hidden gems in Kamakura. Here’s the plan:

1. **8:45 AM – 9:30 AM: Hokokuji Temple + Bamboo Grove** 
2. **9:35 AM – 10:00 AM: Ichijo Ekan Sanso Garden** 
3. **10:05 AM – 10:30 AM: Jōmyō-ji Temple** 
4. **10:45 AM – 11:30 AM: Kōtoku-in (Great Buddha)**
5. **11:40 AM – 12:40 PM: Hasedera Temple** 
6. **12:50 PM – 1:50 PM: Lunch on Komachi-dori Street** 
7. **2:00 PM – 2:45 PM: Tsurugaoka Hachimangū** 
8. **3:00 PM – 4:00 PM: Yuigahama Beach**

"I would cut your destinations in half.

I did a kamakura day trip about 2 weeks ago. I spent about 6 hours there, and all I did was basically went to the beach and Hachimangu. For the rest of the time, I was walking around soaking up the town and looking for lunch. I spent half an hour just talking with a retired resident because I was just chilling on a bench outside a grocery store and he sat down next to me.

I mean, I was certainly by no means efficient, but I thought I had a better time when I wasn't rushing around.",comment_2,r/JapanTravel,Travel,,https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/1kt0s26/kamakura_half_day_trip/

"We just did a half day-ish trip to Kamakura, 

Kotoku-in
Hasadera
Idobata coffee (a must if you like great coffee, had single origin geisha from Panama made pour over out of the back of a van, maybe my favorite coffee place so far).
Walk to the beach/grab lunch/walk through town
Walk down the streets with all the shops (wife wanted the Buddha tayaki)
Hokokuji (this was most out of the way but worth it for us because we’re currently just passing through Kyoto and it was quite people-y at the Kinkaku-ji temple and it will be just as packed there and even more out of the way so I’m glad we’re skipping that).

We almost did another hike near the Bamboo garden that had a nice overlook but Hasadera had a beautiful overlook with a place to sit and eat, so not sad we skipped that either.

And that felt like more than enough, we were able to stop and savor, while still moving along.",comment_4,r/JapanTravel,Travel,,https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/1kt0s26/kamakura_half_day_trip/
"OP, look at the locations on a map. Some of these are 20-30 minutes apart by bus or walking but if you are taking the bus, you also have to wait for the bus to get there which could also be 20-30 minutes. You will end up seeing half this list.   So figure out your must-sees and then have some stretch goals in case you magically see it all, but the times you have are completely unrealistic.   The idea that you could see some additional hidden gems in between all this and also go to the beach is fantasy.",comment_5,r/JapanTravel,Travel,,https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/1kt0s26/kamakura_half_day_trip/

QUESTION: is there anywhere we can get a standalone outdoor onsen experience? Without booking a ryokan or hotel. We didn't know for most of these you had to be a guest to use the onsen.",post,r/JapanTravel,Travel,0.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/1ksi1sp/itinerary_check_please_12_days/
"I would be careful with making other people's experiences yours. We got told Mt Fuji is nothing but a day trip and Kyoto should be a day trip from Osaka. Boy was that a bad recommendation for us. After visiting Japan multiple times in the past 12 months, Kyoto and Mt Fuji became our favourite places where we spent over a week all together. 

That being said, your excursion looks pretty relaxed. Your trip to Nara for example takes up a whole day, but there is only so much to do and see at Nara. You could easily peak at Uni right next to Nara, home of Matcha and a real beautiful place. Or visit the Nintendo museum if you are into that. If you, however, want to take it slow and are open to take a look around corners to discover hidden gems Japan has to offer, it's a good plan. 

I have only ever seen public onsens which can be used without a reservation in Hakone, but they certainly do exist yes.",comment_1,r/JapanTravel,Travel,,https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/1ksi1sp/itinerary_check_please_12_days/

"Just left Kyoto yesterday. My only flags are that the time you plan on going to Kiyomizu-dera and Higashiyama will be packed. That being said, I think that area is alwaya just crowded.

My other flag is that if you can swing it go even earlier to Fushimi Inari. We did it at 5:30am saw all of three people on our hike up. Coming down around 7am it was definitely getting busy. And this was all in the pouring rain. 

I agree with the other commenter, other people's experiences won't necessarily be your own. For example, I really enjoyed Kyoto, and was encouraged to do more than 4 nights. I adjust my itinerary slightly. We did 5 nights and honestly I would have been fine with 4 nights (including a day trip). I could have put the extra night somewhere else on our trip. We templed out quicker than I expected.",comment_3,r/JapanTravel,Travel,,https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/1ksi1sp/itinerary_check_please_12_days/

"You can eat lunch at the Cup Noodle Museum, just keep in mind it's literally just the different Nissen cup noodles from different countries. I had it more as a snack. I did enjoy the museum overall though.

I only did an afternoon in Yokohama as I did Kamakura early in the morning. Did the museum, Gundam robot when it was still there, walked around the waterfront and gardens there. Then I stopped at the Yokohama Brewing taproom (good) and then had dinner at a random izakaya which was buried deep in a neighborhood. Fumbled my way through as they spoke almost no English and only had a chalkboard menu, drank way too much sake over the course of a couple of hours while not ordering enough food, and had to navigate the trains back to my hotel in Shimbashi while pretty drunk lol.

Cable car? Not worth it.  Can walk it in 10 mins along the waterfront.

"Itinerary Check and Feedback Hi everyone. I've been perusing the subreddit for a couple months reading your advice and feedback to others and it's been helpful. My husband and I are going to Japan for a week and a half in early October and I've finally put together a rough draft of an itinerary.

I've done lots of research but I still need to look more into the specifics of things, especially for getting around (how to use the buses and metro, etc.). So I'd appreciate any feedback or tips you can offer. Not just related to that, but to anything that seems applicable. We are both first-timers to Japan.

My husband really wants to have wandering time and take it all in. So if there's a day where it seems like we didn't plan much, it's because we intend to just explore and walk freely around at our own pace and check stuff out.

**Day One:**

Land in Narita in the afternoon Japan time. Get through immigration, get luggage, catch a train over to Tokyo. I know we are going to be exhausted because of the time difference (coming from USA), so I didn't plan really anything for the first day except for finding dinner. Our hotel is in Shinjuku close to Omoide Yokocho, so I figured we'd walk over to it and find dinner there while also sight-seeing it, then go to the hotel and go to bed early.

**Day Two:**

Some shopping (Tower Records)

Shinjuku Gyoen National Garden

Meiji Jingu Shrine

**Day Three:** 

Head up to Kawagoe for Wood Works Kawagoe. 

Explore a bit after the chopstick making at Wood Works, but then come back because I have read that a half-day here is pretty sufficient and there's not much else to do.

Spend the other half of the day exploring Shibuya after coming back down from Kawagoe. Pokemon Center in Shibuya

Try to get a ticket for the Shibuya Sky observation deck specifically around sunset.

**Day Four:**

Sensō-ji Temple

Explore Asakusa and Ueno (we do want some wandering time here, but I'll also still take recs for what specifically would be worth our time here as well if we want to plan anything else)

**Day Five:**

teamLab Borderless

Imperial Palace

Pokemon Center Tokyo DX

Pokemon Cafe, assuming I can get a reservation

**Day Six:**

Check out of Tokyo hotel. Take train to Hakone

Here's where I could use some tips. We have to check into our ryokan in Gora (the Madoka No Mori) at 3 pm, and out the next morning by 10 or 11 am (after which we are headed to Kyoto). Once we've checked in, we want to just stay and enjoy the onsens, so we don't plan to leave. But if we get in from Tokyo early enough, and also book a later train to Kyoto after check-out, then i figure we'd have time to do the Hakone Open Air Museum and the Hakone Ropeway (one before check in on day Six, and the other after check out on Day 7, before we head to Kyoto). We won't have our bags because we'll forward them from Tokyo to Kyoto, so that won't be an issue.

So what I am wondering is, would one of them (museum and ropeway) be better to do before check in after coming from Tokyo and one better after check out, before heading to Kyoto? Or does it not really matter?

**Day Seven:**

Check out of Gora Madoka No Mori and do one of the activities I discussed in the paragraph above.

Take train to Kyoto

Check in to hotel, take it easy, Just find dinner and explore Gion (our hotel is in Gion).

**Day Eight:**

Kodai-ji Temple and Bamboo Forest

Kiyomizu-dera Temple

Yasaka Shrine

(Do those in the morning because they are all pretty close together (10-15 minute walks apart)

For afternoon:

Possibly either Ginkaku-ji Temple or Kinkaku-ji Temple

**Day Nine:**

Osaka Day Trip from Kyoto. Take train to Osaka.

Osaka Castle (morning)

Shitennoji Temple (morning)

Shinsekai District  (afternoon)

Namba Yasaka Jinja (afternoon)

Dotonbori for dinner and vibes before heading back to Kyoto in the evening

**Day Ten:**

Fushimi Inari (morning)

Nintendo Museum (afternoon). If able to get tickets. May not be able to. The backup plan is either Ginkaku-ji Temple or Kinkaku-ji Temple, whichever one we didn't go to on Day 8.

**Day Eleven:**

Train to Tokyo, and flight home. If we can forward our luggage to the airport, so that we don't have to haul it around, we may be able to try to sightsee a bit since our flight isn't until 4:30 pm? But we have to get to Narita from Kyoto which will take a while so probably not.

That's my current loose plan. I'd appreciate any feedback - thanks in advance.",post,r/JapanTravel,Travel,2.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/1ks5k48/itinerary_check_and_feedback/
"It probably doesn’t matter that much, but if it’s cloudy/rainy/windy on day 6, I would go to the museum in the hopes that day 7 will be clearer and you’ll have a better chance of seeing Mt Fuji on the ropeway (and if the weather is severe, the ropeway might even be shut down)",comment_1,r/JapanTravel,Travel,,https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/1ks5k48/itinerary_check_and_feedback/
"First, when you arrive in Japan, get an IC card or app such as Suica. You can travel seamlessly on public transport throughout Japan. If you charge it, you can pass through the ticket gates just by tapping it, without having to calculate the fare and buy a ticket at each station. They are very convenient because you can purchase them without cash not only on public transport but also at all vending machines and convenience stores.",comment_2,r/JapanTravel,Travel,,https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/1ks5k48/itinerary_check_and_feedback/
"Seems pretty doable.  We did Tokyo and Kyoto in 10 days with a day trip to Nara which was nice.  On the way back to the airport you can leave your luggage in lockers in the station, there are a number of spots in Tokyo Station.  The most lockers are in the East-West connector corridor.  We did this while we did a little more in Tokyo before the flight.",comment_3,r/JapanTravel,Travel,,https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/1ks5k48/itinerary_check_and_feedback/

I'm not sure what other people's experiences have been, but Omoide Yokocho hasn't seemed especially tourist-friendly when I've passed through. I'd suggest just going to one of the many hundreds of mid-priced restaurants in Shinjuku near your hotel as these would be much easier to use when you're zonked.

If you can, fly home from Osaka to save a day.",comment_4,r/JapanTravel,Travel,,https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/1ks5k48/itinerary_check_and_feedback/

"First Time Itinerary for Summer Visit - Thoughts? My family of 4 (kids are 8 and 11) are leaving for Japan on June 23rd for a 2.5 week trip. Before booking this trip I did not realize how unpleasant the summer weather can be, especially around Tokyo/Kyoto. We just made a big decision to alter our itinerary to seek out slightly better weather (and maybe slightly fewer crowds). See my proposed itinerary below and let me know your thoughts. We are shifting from Kyoto area which was previously planned to Nagano and surrounds and then heading to the Japanese Alps. 

I'm nervous about this switch since it is sort of last minute. Does anyone have experience with these areas and have some tips or think we are leaving out a cool destination or must do activity? Are we doing too much? We want some city time but are most excited about smaller towns that have culture, nature, onsen experiences and good food. As excited as I was for Kyoto this shift in plan just ensures we will be coming back to Japan another time (and at a better time of year next time!). 

June 24th: Arrival in Tokyo (Narita) at 3pm, check into hotel in Asakusa, explore and go to bed

June 25th Tokyo: Morning exploration of Asakusa, Sumo experience, afternoon/evening head to Ahikabara or Shibuya.

June 26th: Tokyo: Teamlab Planets in morning, explore a different neighborhood in afternoon 

June 27th: Tokyo: Day trip from Tokyo (Nikko, Chofu, Kamakura....open to thoughts and ideas?)

June 28th: Nagano: Explore more of Tokyo in the morning and then train to Nagano. Spend afternoon exploring Zenko-ji temple.

June 29th: Nagano: Day trip to Togakushi Shrine area and Ninja House/Museum

June 30th: Nagano: Travel to nearby Snow Monkey Park area. Stay in ryokan and visit the monkeys/hike.

July 1st: Matsumoto: Train to Matsumoto. Visit the castle and explore city (maybe do a family cooking class)

July 2nd: Hirayu Onsen: Bus 1.5 hrs to Kamikochi. Spend half day there with picnic and hike then bus 30 minutes to Hirayu Onsen. Overnight at ryokan there.

July 3rd: Takayama: Bus to Takayama. Spend afternoon exploring the town (Showa museum for sure)

July 4th: Takayama: Spend morning exploring market. Then, day trip to Shirakawa-Go

July 5th: Gujo Hachiman: Train to Gujo Hachiman. Stay overnight. This small ""water city"" has caught my fancy and I'm excited to just explore it and take in the atmosphere. It is on the way to Nagoya so I thought we'd stop over but it does require a train transfer or two so perhaps it is too much. 

July 6th: Nagoya: Enjoy morning in Gujo Hachiman then take train to Nagoya. Check into hotel and explore (any tips for the city?)

July 7th: Nagoya: Long day. Wake up early and get to Ghibli Park. End of day catch train to Tokyo (Ueno). Check in and go to sleep.

July 8th: Tokyo: Explore anything we had left on our list, last minute shopping

July 9th: Tokyo: Fly out at 5pm",post,r/JapanTravel,Travel,2.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/1ks2u3q/first_time_itinerary_for_summer_visit_thoughts/

"Don't know how firm this is but I'd just do one night in Nagano - train up from Tokyo in the morning, Togakushi for that day, monkey park (it's June, there's no snow) then onto Matsumoto.


Both Togakushi & Jigokudani (monkey park) aren't all day activities so you'll have plenty of time to see Zenko-ji. 


Matsumoto - go to the Modern Art Museum, it's really good. 


Nagoya - Science Museum is fantastic, your kids will love it. 


Takayama - Hida Folk Museum is better than Shirakawago in my opinion. Less people for sure. 


Don't think you're doing too much - definitely not enough in Tokyo so I'd see if you can claw back extra time in your trip (Nagano, Matsumoto) etc. Day Trip - Kamakura (it's a very old town/shrine heavy itinerary so at least Kamakura is something different with the beach too). 


Weather will be OK, certainly didn't need to replan your trip - peak summer July - September. June will be hot but not as humid, or raining. ",comment_4,r/JapanTravel,Travel,,https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/1ks2u3q/first_time_itinerary_for_summer_visit_thoughts/
"Best Culinary experience of my life in Hiroshima So, after a day of intense travelling (we took the Shinkansen to Nara and back to Hiroshima), me and my wife were craving for a nice warm food. We were tired of Okonomiakis and Tepannyakis so I looked up google and found a Grill restaurant, **Grill Hikoboshi**. We kinda took a while to find it since it's located in the second floor of a little commerce, but we found it. Climbed the stairs to face a closed door. Knocked and got in... the chef was quite surprised to see us, he was either expecting someone else or he wasn't expecting anyone, but he greeted us and sat us in. He was cleaning the kitchen, organizing stuff, doing all the chores to start working. He didn't speak much english, almost nothing to be honest, but the language barrier was beaten with google and a huge paper dictionary he had there! He gave us the wine and drinks menu, asked us we liked and disliked and proceed to start cooking. No menu, no nothing, we sensed that everything was to be out of his head. A profound unconfortable silence filled in the room, we were scared what that japanese guy was thinking, and man, our bet in the restaurant paid off! After a while the plates started coming, first a blowtorched sashimi dipped in a lemon juice, so full of flavour, like I never had a sashimi before. We sensed the chef was keen on talking to we started chatting, he wanted to know the fish we liked in Brazil, the dishes we liked, just ""elevator"" chat,  then proceed to the second course, a vines salads, with lots of different spices and plants, things I never tried before, the salad was as flavoured as main course. More talk, he wanted to know our toughts about the city, Japan, we talked about his experience, then came the third course, a sensational fresh sardine in the super aromatic salad. Whe I saw the sardine I immediately thought of a canned sardine and tought that would be an awful tasting fish... I couldn't be ""wronger""! What a delicicous sardine, I never thought a simple sardine could be so delicious in that prepare. To end it all, the main course, a set of Hiroshima steak, cooked and grilled to perfection, that ting melted in my mouth, I'm an avid mean eater, but i never tasted anything like that. Just like every japanese food, almost no salt was used, but it was seasoned perfectly, gosh, what a wonderful meat piece. For dessert he served us a creme brulée style pot that was absolutely delicious too. The whole experience must have taken us some 2 to 3 hours, and we were absolutely shocked with the freshness and variety of flavours he ""invented' with all those ingredients. it wasn't cheap, but it was worth, for us, every yen! Grill Hikoboshi, a very very veyr pleasant surprise in Hiroshima.",post,r/JapanTravel,Travel,214.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/1kr5yrz/best_culinary_experience_of_my_life_in_hiroshima/

"Itinerary Check: 14 nights between Tokyo, Nikko, Takayama, Kyoto I've previously been to Tokyo, Kyoto, Osaka (+ a day trip to Hiroshima) but my wife has never been. How does the below look for a 14 night trip?  too much movement or any place you would add a day?

* Nights 1-4: **Tokyo**
   * Day 1: arrive, explore shinjuku, shibuya
   * Day 2: Meiji Shrine & Yoyogi Park; Takeshita Street; Omotesando; hibuya Scramble Crossing + Hachiko Statue; Shinjuku at night
   * Day 3: Senso-ji Temple and Nakamise Shopping Street (Asakusa); Tokyo Skytree or Sumida River walk; Ueno Park (optional: Tokyo National Museum or Ueno Zoo); Akihabara
   * Day 4: Possible day trip to Kamakura or Yokohama or just relax
* Nights 5+ 6: **Nikko**
   * Day 5: Depart Tokyo by train to Nikko (\~2 hours) ; Toshogu Shrine, Shinkyo Bridge, and Rinno-ji
   * Day 6: Visit Kegon Falls and Lake Chuzenji ; light hiking or a relaxing onsen experience
* Night 7: **Tokyo** **stopover** (breaking up travel day from Nikko to Takayama); 
   * Day 7: Tokyo Stopover - travel day back from Nikko , use as rest day before heading to Takayama
* Nights 8+9: **Takayama**
   * Day 8: Morning train to Takayama (via Nagoya, \~4.5 hrs total) ; Explore Sanmachi Suji ; Visit a local sake brewery; stay in ryokan
   * Day 9: Visit Hida Folk Village (Hida no Sato) **;** Morning market along the Miyagawa River
* Nights 10-13: **Kyoto**
   * Day 10: Travel to Kyoto (by train \~2.5 hrs) ; Nishiki Market, Gion, and Pontocho for evening walk and dinner
   * Day 11: Arashiyama Bamboo Grove ; Tenryu-ji Temple ; Monkey Park Iwatayama
   * Day 12: Fushimi Inari Taisha ; Uji (Byodo-in Temple and matcha tasting) ; Fushimi Sake District tour
   * Day 13: Ginkaku-ji ; Philosopher’s Path ; Nanzen-ji Temple ; Kiyomizu-dera & Sannenzaka/Ninenzaka streets in the afternoon
* Night 14: Tokyo (flight home next day)
   * day 14: train back to Tokyo for 1 last night in Tokyo before flight

So:

* 6 nights total in Tokyo
* 2 nights in Nikko
* 2 nights in Takayama
* 4 nights in Kyoto

Anything you would change? Maybe 1 less night in Tokyo to add to one of the shorter stays? Maybe add a night in Kyoto to do a day trip to either Osaka or Hiroshima or Nara?

In Takayama I would find 2-3 hour slot for a short train trip to Hida-Fukuyama, a nice small town with beautiful koi fishes.  On the first day in Kyoto, I would go to Himeji first, leave luggage at coin logger and spend a half day enjoying Himeji Castle  before return to Kyoto in the afternoon.

For Day 7 I'd consider staying in Nagoya for the evening. It breaks up the travel more conveniently to get you to Takayama earlier and you can get a hotel near the station much more affordably than in Tokyo Another option would be to do your Yokohama day trip that day (either staying around Shin-Yokohama Station or heading to Nagoya afterwards). ",comment_5,r/JapanTravel,Travel,,https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/1krz955/itinerary_check_14_nights_between_tokyo_nikko/

"Day 3 looks packed.
While I don't say it's not possible, the things I witnessed in Japan when I went (was my first time) and it was my lifelong dream to go there, is you'll encounter stuff you didn't plan for and hang around way longer than planned. For example the Togetsukyo bridge, I went there without any planning or expectation. The moment I left the station the walk to it I already stopped twice to check somethings around like the neighborhood. Once arrived at the bridge I was enjoying the views, had a ice cream , sat somewhere underneath the bridge to soak in the view and once I passed the bridge, to my surprise there was a Monkey Park, it was totally worth it as well, the walk to the monkey park was around 20 mins to the top, where you have an beautiful view of Kyoto as well, I spend hours around the area without that being the plan. And that's been the case for many places in Japan, because I loved walking around and you get to see and explore so much without you even knowing",comment_1,r/JapanTravel,Travel,,https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/1kruz6a/kyoto_4_days_itinerary/

"Plus Size at USJ I’ve lurked on Reddit for a while prior to my trip to see what would work for me at USJ and what wouldn’t. Now that I’ve completed my USJ visit, here’s how it went:

(Context: US18 women’s, most of weight is carried in midsection and chest)

1) JAWS- boat ride, no lap bar or restraint. Fairly easy to get in and out of.
2) Jurassic Park The Ride - lap bar that goes over everyone in the row. Also not bad, but definitely leave your bags in a locker for this one, it was a pain having to take it out from under the bar at the end of the ride with the bar’s large cushioning in the way.
3) Ice Gliders (Sliders? I forgot the name) - kid’s ride in Minion Land. This was a seatbelt mechanism, which worked for me. Do pull far out though as the seatbelt itself was hard to pull out.
4) Cupcake Spinners in the Hello Kitty area- no bar or constraint, easy for me to fit in. Similar to the Alice in Wonderland spinning teacups at Disney.
5) Mario Kart- sat in the back row (way more leg room) and had no issues. Worker discretely made sure lap bar was down far enough for everyone in vehicle, so it made me feel not as ousted. Seat IS quite small, so for anyone with a bigger bum or hips, try out the test seat!
6) Mine Cart Madness- bigger seat than Mario Kart but it does sink in deep, so again- bigger bums beware! Ride was fun, quite jolting! But no issue for fitting in. 

I didn’t attempt anything else, the park was busy and humid and I was too afraid to try testing out seats for other rides.",post,r/JapanTravel,Travel,11.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/1krn62j/plus_size_at_usj/

"Just to add to this (F, UK 16 - 18)

Harry Potter forbidden Journey = Seats are relatively bigger than other thrill rides, restrain bar over the chest is a bit on the tight side. 


Harry Potter flight of the hippogriff = Children's min-coaster. I did fit though found the seat small & had little leg room. The worker wasn't happy with the fit even though the bars closed so I was asked to get off the ride. Avoid this one if you're plus sized, it turned out to be for kids anyway.

"15 Days. 1 Dream Trip to Japan. Itinerary Review Needed – August Travel with My Wife! Hi, I and my wife would be travelling to Japan in Mid-August. I know not the best season for Japan, but this is when I am getting some holidays and breathing time before year end and always wanted to visit Japan so thought why not let's go.

  
Spent lot of time researching (at least I think of it) and have come down to below itinerary. We like to explore a lot and spend very less time in our hotel rooms. Reaching out to community to review it and provide your feedback and suggestions wherever you can. It would be highly appreciated. 

We will be landing on Haneda Airport on 16th Aug early morning and depart from Haneda on 31st. In total I have full 15 days in Japan. Below is my itinerary:

  
**Day 1 - Tokyo**

* Land early morning at Haneda Airport

**Day 2 - Tokyo**

* Imperial Palace - Start early morning
* Art Aquarium (I think my wife would enjoy it)

* 3D Cat, Godzilla Head, Shinjuku Scramble - Evenings
* Find Good Place to Dinner and Drinks - Suggestions always welcome :)



**Day 3 - Tokyo**

* Sensō-ji
* Tonkatsu lunch (Reservations/ Tickets/ Klook - Any other recommendation for experiencing some fun Sumo wrestling up close, and do they have vegan/vegetarian options for my wife?)
* Nezu Shrine,
* Yanaka Ginza - For Dinner and Drinks



**Day 4 - Tokyo**

* DisneySea 



**Day 5,6,7 and 8 (Something with nature/beach, island etc)(I can also decrease 1 day here and increase 1 in Osaka)**

Hakone, Kamakura and Mt Fuji (not able to plan the correct way yet like where to stay etc)

Any suggestion would be welcomed.

Also, if I decide on these 3 destinations, which is the better place to stay? 

Priority is always to see best of Japan (I know opinions can vary but love to hear thoughts from the community).



**Day 9 - Kyoto**

* Stay somewhere in Gion (Gran Bell Hotel/ Ryokan/ Sanjo)
* Kiyomizu-dera
* Sannenzaka - Walking Street

* Nishiki Market - Food and Drinks (Open to other Suggestions)



**Day 11 - Kyoto & ?**

* Arashiyama Bamboo Forest - Early Morning
* Nara/Amanohashidate/Something else in Kyoto to spend rest of the day - All suggestions are welcome. Not sure if Nara is a bit overhyped (ssorry no offence intended, I understand every place has its own aura.) Just want to make best of my limited time there.

Kyo Train Garaku (Koalamachi Station) to Osaka? Does it only run on weekends? Will I get the tickets with reserved seats on Klook ?



**Day 12 - Osaka**

* Osaka Castle
* Kuromon (Street Food)

**Day 13 - Osaka**

**Day 15 - To**kyo

* Tokyo Tower, 
* Team Lab Planets/Borderless - Both seem similar. Still doing research on what to choose.
* Any suggestions for afternoons and late evening? As it will be our last night in Japan.



**Day 16 - Sayo Nara**

  
Looking for review from the community and experienced travelers in Japan. And thank you for your time.

Also, one last thing I want to book tickets of almost everything (from shrines to Trains and From Entertainment Parks to Towers) in advance from Klook. Is it reliable and accepted ?",post,r/JapanTravel,Travel,2.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/1krss5u/15_days_1_dream_trip_to_japan_itinerary_review/
Okay was not aware of this. Will skip Art Aquarium.,comment_1,r/JapanTravel,Travel,,https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/1krss5u/15_days_1_dream_trip_to_japan_itinerary_review/
"I'd advise against the Art Aquarium in favour of... literally any other aquarium.
The fish there are treated as sole display objects without places to hide, often with way too many animals in the tanks.
If you want illuminated fish, there's a light show at Kaiyukan as well and most of that aquarium is actually good. 


If possible, try to buy tickets from the websites (Disney, Team Lab, ...). Klook is an unnecessary middle man.
Train tickets you can also buy at the station. 


Are you a fan of theme parks or just going because they're often mentioned here? With only fifteen days I'd cut out one of them if it's for the latter reason.


Have you thought about going into the Alps instead of the coast? At least in September it was a lot better temperature wise in the mountains.",comment_2,r/JapanTravel,Travel,,https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/1krss5u/15_days_1_dream_trip_to_japan_itinerary_review/

"Kyushu or Hokkaido in September? Hey everyone!

Me and a friend are booking our Japan trip from early September until the start of October. I've been several times before, so I've seen the Golden Triangle, so we're (mostly) going to some less traveled places. 

  
We're doing:

Fujikawaguchiko

Kanazawa (and seeing the surrounding areas like Shirakawago, etc)

Kamakura

  
But we're torn between spending a week, in either Kyushu or Hokkaido. We're both huge fans of culture and onsens, and with Beppu being the Onsen capital of Japan (or so I've heard), that sounds very attractive to us both. We're not hikers or mountain climbers, so Hokkaido is slightly less appealing to us.

However, I've read that the heat and humidity around this time is beyond brutal, especially in the southern regions. I'm from a subtropical climate, but I really don't function well in the heat and I'd be much more comfortable in a cooler place like Hokkaido.

If it were spring or late fall, I'd definitely be picking Kyushu. But with the heat being the factor that it is...the choices are less clear.

So. Based on all this, what would you suggest we pick? There are lots of good onsen places in Hokkaido? Would late September be cool \*enough\* for us to be able to do Kyushu without melting into a sweaty puddle within two minutes? 

Thanks a lot!",post,r/JapanTravel,Travel,2.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/1krpvgg/kyushu_or_hokkaido_in_september/
"Weather in Japan has been relatively hard to predict in the recent years, so bear in mind that any prediction might turn out to be completely wrong. We have been to Japan four times in the past 12 months and weather was always different than the internet and predictions claimed it to be. 

We have been to Japan last year from mid September till early October, traveling from Tokyo to Fukushima and while it definitely was hot, it was bearable because the nights were around 20°C. I heard from locals that two weeks prior it was still way worse though, so end of August/early September was the final week of the extreme summer heat. 

We aren't great with heat either, but having an umbrella, hats and cooling pads helped. Use common sense and don't stay out in the sun during noon with no protection on asphalt without any water.

"I think it's doable and you've made some good choices. You're going to be very busy through. One thing I will caution on is that you really want to get out early in the am to beat the bus tours to Kyoto sights. We found that by 11am you could barely move at some places, especially the markets. Osaka was just always busy so you just have to go with it.

That being said we were pleasantly surprised by how quiet things were once you get away from the tour groups. There's lots to see just wandering through random neighborhoods and along the river walkway.

"If you're looking to do nōryō-yuka along the Kamo, I suggest you make a reservation ahead of time, and double check you are within the season that it is available. You can find some more info here → [https://yuka-kyoto.com/](https://yuka-kyoto.com/)

Since your Ōsaka days are fully booked, I'll only mention your Kyōto days. You could probably fit another location on Day 4 no problem, like Heian-jingu, or the KYOCERA art museum.

Uji is great, worth a whole day. If I could recommend that instead of leaving your luggage with the hotel it might be easier to take it to Kyōto station and leave it in a coin locker until you return. In Uji, Byōdō-in is fine, leaving via the south exit will allow you to reach the bridges to the small island in the river, and in the area are many good places for tea. Additionally the Uji Tea Museum has experiences for making matcha, and audio guided tours in various languages to learn about the town history and tea making in general.

Day 7 will be rough, there's a lot of queuing involved in Kinkaku-ji and Arashiyama bamboo forest as both are heavily touristed. Personally I would cut Kinkaku-ji entirely, I do not think it is worth it with the current crowding. In the area of Arashiyama, Saga Toriimoto preserved street and Adashino Nenbutsu-ji are far and away better. 

Otherwise a fine itinerary for hitting the most internationally famous locations.",comment_2,r/JapanTravel,Travel,,https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/1krsqvn/8day_osakakyotouji_itinerary_check_second_trip_to/

"Lucky you. For the airline, it's a tiny additional cost to move you into a seat they haven't sold, and serve you a meal and drinks that in the grand scale of things doesn't cost them much. The real benefit to them is that we're now talking about BA on this thread, you've probably mentioned it to a dozen people, and the people you've spoken to might think they'll get upgraded if they book a flight. It's very cheap PR to bump peasants into the rich people cabin :)

Or, the man or lady on the check in desk liked your face, or you looked like you needed a little lift, or they just did it randomly!

I try it every single flight and got upgraded twice, once with Qatar Airways (they rejected the guy in front who made up some sob story, I jokingly asked and they enjoyed it and pushed me up).

Best credit card for travel? (No travel portal) I have narrowed it down to the Wells Fargo autograph journey (4% travel). Is this my best bet? I travel internationally once a year (lax to spain) any help would be appreciated as I can’t make my mind up,post,r/TravelHacks,Travel,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/TravelHacks/comments/1kumkd1/best_credit_card_for_travel_no_travel_portal/
"Its actually 5x hotels, 4x airlines, and 3x restaurants and other travel.

A $50 statement credit for airline purchases helps nerf the annual fee, but it lacks any other benefits to offset the fee like Pre/Global Entry, checked bag credits, no lounge access etc...

IMO the base Autograph is a very good card, but the Journey leaves a bit to be desired.

Contrast that with Bank Of America Premium Rewards. You get the same $95 AF and the same sign up bonus, but you get TSA PRe/GE credit and $100 incidental airline credits. The airline credits do have to be from a flight that starts at a domestic US carrier, and has a couple of exclusions like Frontier. But if you travel a couple times a year, this credit is very easy to take advantage of and they're basically giving you $5 to use the card.

The two big drawbacks to BOA PR is the multipliers of 2x travel/dining and 1.5 everything else are pretty mid, and you can only redeem for statement credit unless you invest with BOA/ML or have a BOA checking/savings account.

Chase Sapphire Preferred gets the same $95 AF, and another $50 hotel credit, but has IMO much better transfer partners with Hyatt and Southwest. There's also a DashPass credit if you're into that. You can also pair this with Chase Freedom Flex and Freedom Unlimited to really rack up rewards points.",comment_1,r/TravelHacks,Travel,,https://www.reddit.com/r/TravelHacks/comments/1kumkd1/best_credit_card_for_travel_no_travel_portal/

"What exactly does Allianz travel insurance cover, and can I add 2 people to the policy when one of them is already abroad? More specifically, one of my kids is in Europe already for a study abroad thing. My other kid is meeting her when her program ends and they are traveling around Europe for about a month. Can I put both kids on one policy to cover their train, bus, plane tickets while they are together? And what happens if they miss their train (they get lost, they are running late and miss it, etc.) would the cost of their tickets me covered or is it only if they miss the train because of bad weather or severe illness? And also, how do you determine how much of your trip to cover?

"Best carry-on recs for frequent travel? Prioritizing comfort & max space Hey everyone, I’m going to be traveling a lot over the next couple of years, and I’m on the hunt for a solid carry-on. I’m looking for something that’s super comfortable to travel with (easy to roll, carry, etc.) but also gives me as much space as possible while still fitting within international carry-on limits.

Price definitely matters, but if something is really worth it for the long haul, I’m open to investing. Hard shell or soft shell, I don’t really care, just want something reliable, durable, and roomy.

"Traveling with a 3 year old - NYC chaos tips and tricks Hi all, we are visiting NYC for a week and majority of the time I will be solo parenting. I would appreciate any tips on traveling with a toddler in a very busy city (even if it wasn’t NYC you did it for) or must have essentials to keep travel easy. I have never travelled with my toddler in such a crowded city before, so I’m nervous about it all - the logistics of getting around the city, packing, you name it. 

A few things:
- We are staying in Manhattan near Penn Station, and the hotel room is TINY lol. I’m planning to get a packable hanging cube to help
- will be getting car service to/from airport 
- I have a backpack leash, a foldable stroller, backpack that hooks into the stroller, and links to the MTA accessible stations + the status of the elevators (so I can be ready to carry the stroller if needed)

Thank you in advance!",post,r/TravelHacks,Travel,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/TravelHacks/comments/1kucduu/traveling_with_a_3_year_old_nyc_chaos_tips_and/
"Not quite NYC, but I recently did three days each in Berlin and Salzburg with a 2 and 4 year old while my wife was at conferences. I was worried before the first trip, but I'm now excited for my next solo parenting trip!

My learnings and top tips:

\- Take loads of snacks and water, more than you'll need, as they'll burn energy just looking at stuff

\- Book kid-friendly attractions in advance. It gives you a focus for the day, keeps them occupied and means you don't end up wandering aimlessly with a bored toddler. Try a trip to the huge M&M store (free), the Museum of Ice Cream or the kids zoo in Central Park. GetYourGuide is great for this.

\- Your stroller / pram isn't for your child. It's for you to dump your bags, shopping, food etc in when you're carrying them :)

\- Don't be embarrassed / ashamed of handing them your iPad / phone for 10 minutes if you need to figure out where you're going, sort out a table at a restaurant, breathe for a few minutes.

\- Don't spend lots of money on things to do, toys etc. Make fun out of counting pigeons, looking at cool buildings, looking out for flags etc.

\- Don't feel like a failure if you end up back at your hotel when your little monster has a nuclear meltdown on the subway. Take a break, force a nap, and get back out there.

\- Look for a playpark, let them loose and chat to other parents, who will give you great tips of where's good for kids

\- McDonalds and Starbucks are always good for a baby change, and usually the staff will let the whole 'restroom is for customers only' thing slide

\- Pack three changes of clothes and a spare t shirt for you, when the inevitable spillage happens

Have fun and don't worry about the crowds / stroller. Be strong, push your way through and think like a local – NYC folks don't move for others!",comment_1,r/TravelHacks,Travel,,https://www.reddit.com/r/TravelHacks/comments/1kucduu/traveling_with_a_3_year_old_nyc_chaos_tips_and/
"This is more NYC-specific advice...

Don't stress too much about using a non-accessible subway station, or let that keep you from going somewhere you want to go. Someone will help you carry the stroller up and down the stairs. Same goes for using buses.

People and dog watching in Central Park is world-class. You can spend a whole day in the park just watching people and letting your kid climb on things. You'll get amazing pics on the Great Lawn of the skyline and your kiddo toddling around. Go to the boat yard/launch to watch people race radio controlled boats. There's a merry-go-round, I think. The zoo is amazing and has lots of places to climb. There are several playgrounds situated throughout the park - the one near the Met is top notch, as is the one across the park at CPW and like 90th or so.

When you get to the city buy a ball, a pinwheel, and bubbles. Get them delivered to the hotel, or have some fun checking out NYC versions of grocery stores and drug/pharmacy stores. Coloring books and crayons are a solid option. Pack an old sheet to sit on for the park. Get snacks etc from a grocery store - they're going to be smaller than you're used to, but they'll have everything you need, and are also a solid choice for putting together ""picnic"" lunches or dinners that will be way less than restaurants.

Don't stress about your kid ""annoying"" other people, unless the behavior is OBVIOUSLY annoying. The city is full of parents, and kids growing up there. When you see someone pushing a stroller/kids your child's age or older, ask them what their favorite thing to do with kids in the city is. People will help you. Trust me, they will let you know if you or your child are a problem.

You are going to be exhausted. It's a lot of walking, and a lot of energy, so rest when your kid falls asleep. Otherwise, have fun!

"flying with NOT FRESH ear infection I know that it is generally very recommended to not do it- but Im wondering if due to my timeline Im okay (at least from physical damage)

"What happens if I refuse to pay rental car damages that I did not create? I rented a vehicle through one of the largest rental company in the US. Upon returning the car I was not informed of any damages, but received notification later that there were new damages. 

This notification had a before and after photo coming from an automated system, with the after photo circling a small scratch on the hubcap. Small enough I don’t even think it would have been noticed on a human inspection. The before photo is taken at a different angle and also completely different lighting. An automated chat bot sent me a different photo as proof which actually appears to show the damage in the pre-rental photo. I am nearly certain this damage was pre existing. I am also 100% certain I did not hit anything with the car and even if this is new it is normal wear and tear. 

At this point I have spent multiple weeks calling and emailing, have been redirected all over the place. Nobody is able to help me. Emails have not been responded to. I can’t even begin to dispute this damage as nobody will talk to me. I am coming up in the “final date” to pay before extra fees will be charged. 

I am wondering what the risk is to me if I refuse to pay. It’s only a few hundred dollars, so I’m not sure if it’s worth the trouble if there is substantial risk to my credit or something like that. But, I also really don’t want to pay this without even being given the opportunity to dispute the claim.",post,r/TravelHacks,Travel,38.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/TravelHacks/comments/1kt4g6w/what_happens_if_i_refuse_to_pay_rental_car/

"GPS/Asset Trackers for luggage? I'm not interested in bluetooth-only trackers such as AirTag or Tile. I'm only interested in GPS or maybe cell tower trackers, or a combination of bluetooth and/or cell tower and/or GPS. GPS is definitely preffered. Has anyone had any luck with these products?

With the traditional bluetooth products, not only would thiefs have to have the right kind of phone, I'd have to have that kind of phone too, and thiefs have to have bluetooth enabled. For example, with airtag, I need an iPhone, the thief needs an iphone, and he needs blueetooth enabled. 


• Jiobit Smart Tag
• Tracki GPS Tracker
• LandAirSea 54 GPS Tracker
• GEGO GPS Luggage Tracker
• Family1st Portable GPS Tracker
• PAJ GPS Suitcase Tracker
• AirBolt GPS Tracker

There's also products called ""Asset Trackers""
Like Cube Tracker

They have a Sim or esim and there is monthly subscription but I think it might be a good idea. Not sure if they work in most countries, hopefully they do since it's presumably satellite, not cell towers? But not every sat network is global...
Unsure how they work through a pelican case, through a steel car body, inside a building, inside a parking garage, inside a shipping container, etc. Probably not great. But if your shit makes it into a concrete building and/or a shipping container, it's probably too late anyway. I've also seen trackers for like snowmobiles that claim they need to be exposed to the sky. If that's the case, this isn't going to work, theyre gonna be inside a suitcase.

Also, luggage is sometimes lost due to incompetence.  I plan on using a GPS for other things, not just luggage

Mask or handkerchief for the dust!,comment_4,r/TravelHacks,Travel,,https://www.reddit.com/r/TravelHacks/comments/1ktilo8/packing_tips_for_photo_safari/
"Pack light. Save your space and weight for camera gear. You can sink wash clothes and hang them to dry. If you've got good travel clothes like lightweight merino wool, you don't even need to wash them daily. Remember that you're on safari, not a fashion show -- the lions won't care that you're wearing the same clothes every day. One pair of comfortable trail shoes will do.

Wear earth tones. Darks attract tse tse, animals don't like brights (although tse tses love bright blue), lights show the dirt and dust. Have a mask or scarf so you're not inhaling the dust, and glasses/sunglasses are a must.

Wear layers. The temperature changes dramatically through the day. You may want a jackey, hat, neck scarf, and gloves for cold mornings. In the afternoon, you'll want lighter clothing and a broad-brimmed hat. I like long sleeves and pants to keep the bugs away, others don't care.

Pack sunscreen, insect repellent (I prefer picaridin to deet), and meds, especially the anti-malarials and the anti-diarrheals. (I always travel with azithromycin.) Make sure you're fully vaccinated (Hep A&B, typhoid, etc), and I recommend Dukoral for cholera. Also remember Tylenol, antibiotic cream for cuts and scrapes, bandaids, etc.

Otherwise bring the same toiletries you bring on every trip -- razor, nail clippers, etc. Oh, but when you pack your toiletries, add some tissues/toilet paper. Those park toilets are not always serviced!

Make sure you have an extra battery for all your cameras so that you can swap out on the go. Yes, cameras plural: make sure you bring a backup camera and more than one lens, just in case you have an issue with one. I recommend also having a power pack that you can use to charge batteries and your phone.

A headlamp/flashlight comes in handy. And a metal insulated water bottle.

Finally, bring your patience and sense of humour. You can't really ""plan"" a safari. You may go an hour or more seeing nothing of particular interest -- and then something amazing will happen.

"International 2FA SMS and calls with iPhone left at home? I will be traveling internationally for several months and want to be able to receive SMS 2FA and calls to my US phone number on AT&T without incurring roaming charges. Here's my proposed plan; is it viable?

* Port my US-based AT&T phone number to a spare iPhone 6 I have at the house
* Set up my AppleID account's message forwarding, WiFi calling, and Calls on Other Devices
* Leave this phone at home in the US, plugged in to power and active on my home WiFi as well as AT&T cellular
* Travel with my other devices (iPhone, iPad) and purchase eSIM and/or use WiFi in the countries I travel to

"Sixt Car Rental ignoring me I had a pretty bad experience with my last Sixt rental.

"Free Trial eSIM Services: Test Before You Commit As someone who loves finding deals and free offers when traveling, I discovered that some International and US companies now offer free trials for their services, which you can use both locally and abroad!. You don’t need a credit card, and there’s no need for a physical SIM card, just an eSIM to get started.

**Hack for Travelers:** If you’re visiting the US from abroad, you can install these eSIM plans as long as your phone is compatible and unlocked. It’s a great way to get connected quickly and avoid roaming. It’s definitely worth looking into, as it could be a great hack.

If you’ve already tried any of these services, I’d love to hear about your experience. Would you recommend them? While these trials are a great way to test things out, they may not allow you to fully assess the pros and cons of a provider in such a short time.

Here’s a roundup of some of the best eSIM free trial offers:

**US Cellular**

* 30-day trial via the app
* Keep your current phone, carrier, and number
* A convenient option if you’re not ready to switch everything over yet

**AT&T**

* 30-day free trial
* Full access to their wireless network
* No credit card or commitments required

**Visible**

* 15-day free trial
* Unlimited Verizon 5G & 4G LTE coverage
* No credit card or payment required

**Cricket Wireless**

* 14-day trial
* No credit card needed to activate

**GigSky**

* Free eSIM trial with 100MB of data
* Great for testing their international service

**Verizon**

* 30-day free trial
* No credit card required to start

**MobileX**

* Free eSIM trial with up to 10 days of service
* 5GB of data included
* No credit card for activation

**Nomad**

* Free 500MB eSIM data trial
* Great for travel

While these are some of the top options I’ve found, there are also international providers offering great coverage and discounts, though I haven’t found any offering free eSIM trials.

**Tip:**  
Check out the network coverage, see how fast the speeds are, and make sure customer support is responsive. The last thing you want is to get stuck with a provider that leaves you stranded when you need help the most!",post,r/TravelHacks,Travel,5.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/TravelHacks/comments/1ks7fji/free_trial_esim_services_test_before_you_commit/

"Question regarding flight delays in the US I am an Aussie travelling to the US in a couple months. On my way home I have a domestic flight (American Air) that gets me to LAX approximately 7 hours before my international flight (Delta). Should my domestic flight be delayed causing me to miss the international, what is the standard procedure in the US?

I.e. Will one of the airlines organise for me to be re-booked? Is that something I should have insurance for? If so, any recommendations for insurers?

I’ll be contacting them directly as well to confirm but I just want to get a feel for what is considered normal procedure in the US.

"You're getting some mixed answers about what happens if you arrive late for your international flight on Delta, but the answer isn't so simple.  As a full-service airline in the U.S., Delta will usually rebook you for free if you arrive at the check-in counter a little late.  (When you call Delta, ask if they will tell you their exact definition of ""a little late."")

If you were also traveling internationally on American (or another oneWorld carrier) instead of Delta, American has a policy that will protect you *even on separate tickets*, which AFAIK is unique among U.S. airlines.

If you were on a low-cost carrier (such as Zipair to Tokyo) and arrived just a little late for check-in, they would tell you they are sorry but you have to buy a new ticket.

These ""flat-tire rules"" can save you in a pinch, but I wouldn't rely on them.  A 7-hour layover is plenty, but if you have any desire to visit L.A., maybe arrive the day before and incorporate an overnight stay into your itinerary.",comment_4,r/TravelHacks,Travel,,https://www.reddit.com/r/TravelHacks/comments/1ksl3mu/question_regarding_flight_delays_in_the_us/

"Questions about Hertz rental at TPA 
*Posting this here because I have been completely unable to reach the Hertz counter at the Tampa International Airport. Their phone line just disconnects whenever I try any of their automated options. Hopefully someone here is knowledgeable/ has experience with this.*

I’m 23, looking to rent a car in Florida for about a week. I am a AAA member, which is why I’m using Hertz in the first place (no young driver fees). I have two questions:

1. Does Hertz rent pickup trucks to “young drivers” (ie. under 25)? I haven’t been able to find any information on this. Their website says young drivers can rent small/large sedans, SUVs, and minivans, and that young drivers are excluded from all the fancy cars. Nowhere does it mention pickups. 

2. Does the Hertz at TPA accept after-hours drops? Also can’t find any information on that. I would need to use the after hour drop, so this is important.

"Advice: Short Layover or Last flight out to destination? Hello All! 

Looking for advice for which flight I should take to guarantee I arrive during my travel day.

The airline is Vueling. 

I am traveling from Istanbul to Ibiza and have 2 flight options that both have a layover in Barcelona.

Option 1: 55 minute layover in Barcelona to take 9:55pm flight to final destination 

Option 2: 1 hour 50 min layover in Barcelona to take 10:50pm flight to final destination (this is the last flight of the day to Ibiza) 

I’m torn between the 2 options because Option 1 seems risky with the short layover time (I called Vueling - they said I would NOT have to go through passport control during my layover) vs Option 2 is risky since it’s the last flight to Ibiza that day. I know if it gets cancelled I can take the next flight out in the morning but that is an issue for me because I have scheduled activities that start early on Thursday. 

I plan to check a hold bag and take random seats (so I could be at the back of the plane).",post,r/TravelHacks,Travel,2.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/TravelHacks/comments/1krx0lp/advice_short_layover_or_last_flight_out_to/

"I’d go with Option 2. A 55-min layover sounds tight, especially with a checked bag and random seat.

"Thinking of buying a portable pill container for travel, is it worth it? What should I look for? Hey everyone,

I'm heading on a trip soon and I've been seeing a lot of ads for portable/travel pill containers. They seem like they could be pretty convenient, but I'm not sure if they're just a gimmick or genuinely useful.

I'd love to get your thoughts:

1. Have you ever bought or used a portable pill container specifically for travel? What was your experience like?
2. Based on your experience, do you think it's generally worth getting one for a trip?
3. If I do decide to buy one, what are the most important features or things I should consider to make sure I get a good/practical one? (e.g., size/capacity for number of days, material, durability, type of closure, number of compartments, ease of filling, discreteness, waterproofness, etc.)

Any recommendations for specific types or brands are also welcome if you have them, but mostly looking for general advice on whether they're useful and what features matter most.

"Depending where and how you’re traveling, it’s usually best to keep pills in their original labeled containers in case they get searched by like TSA or border agents, etc. If you’re just road tripping it’s probably fine, but if you’re going through airports, keep them in their bottles. 

That said, yes, I use one at home and I take it with me when I travel and just fill it when I get to the destination. They’re great! I’ve never been so good about taking everything daily as I have since getting one. 

Ones with the days of the weeks marked is best.

"Air travel with 5 and 2 yo Treat me like I'm 5 and what I need to do for air travel for kids on the plane. It will be their first trip (2.5hr) and I've only flown twice myself. Husband is an expert, but sans kids. Myrtle beach is the destination. 

Both are in FF 5point harness car seats currently and I'm unsure what to bring for the trip. I'd be open to buying cheaper seats for the trip, as their normal seats are pretty bulky. I know the harnesses exist but those are like $170 a piece.

What's recommended for both ages? The 5 year old would probably be fine in a normal seatbelt and I could rent a seat with the car, or get a harness for plane.
The 2 year old would probably be best contained in a seat .. 
if we're bringing a seat for the 2 year old, I don't mind bringing one also for the older kid- (he's large though 50lbs and tall)
I need some expert advice 🙃
Is a car seat dolly worth it ?

I know tons of snacks is good, random odds and ends to play with, tablets..

Also, is a wagon worth bringing? I have the larger Veer and have heard those can be gate checked for delta.. I don't even know what that means, does it go below the plane still? I wouldn't want to bring it if it gets thrown down there.",post,r/TravelHacks,Travel,0.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/TravelHacks/comments/1krb1vx/air_travel_with_5_and_2_yo/
"The ride safer “car seat” cannot be used on an airplane. 

There are the cares harnesses which are ~$50 and only for airplanes. 

Keep in mind that many car seats will not fit due to size and most airlines require them to be in the window seat. 

Unless you have a small travel stroller like a gbpockit, it will go in the hold with everything else (the same with a car seat). 

Make sure the 2YO is able to use earphones. It can take a couple weeks to “train” them. 

Sell up juice/soda on the plane and unlimited screen time. 

The more stressed you are, the more stressed/act out the kids will be. Kids are humans too. 2YO cry and act their age. They are allowed to. As a parent on the plane people care that are you trying to help them and get more irritated at parents that don’t do anything than kids that are crying. 

If the youngest is in diapers brings some ziplocks and when they have their poop on the plane, put the diaper in a ziplock before you trash it. 

You can check a car seat. Sometimes renting is more expensive than actually buying a car seat. 

We use a cares harnesses for our 2YO and nothing for our 4 year old. 

We use a ride safer vest for the 4YO (a booster in europe/places the vest isn’t approved) and a wayb pico for the 2YO (wouldn’t recommend buying one for a single trip, we travel a lot). Many people check their full size car seats.",comment_1,r/TravelHacks,Travel,,https://www.reddit.com/r/TravelHacks/comments/1krb1vx/air_travel_with_5_and_2_yo/
The car vest and the airplane vest are different. Don’t bother with those. Just carry on the car seat for the 2yo and use it on the plane. At 5 I’d get a booster and carry it on but you can’t use it. Don’t get the inflatable booster at that age- ours just played on it and we had to go buy a real one anyway bc it wasn’t safe. 6 is more like the minimum for that. We always flew with a Diono radian bc it folds into a backpack and is super skinny so it fits easily on planes. It’s also low enough the tray works over it. Not cheap but it’s a really good seat anyway.

Btw, bag is most likely to be lost in transit, not stuck at home, so in your case it would reach china but not Japan. But also, even if you know its lost, it doesent help you much, you are in transit and will only get to complain over it not coming, when you reach the end destination.

I bought my tracker for buses and trains. I have taken a few rides where I drop my bag either at the luggage area of the train or under the bus, then sit far from it. And I get anxious if the bag is still there. If I have a tracker, I will know that it is. Realistically, if someone takes it, the bus or train isnt gonna stop for me. But it gives peace of mind that I dont have to keep looking at everybody leaving the bus if they are about to steal my bag.

For flights, always pack essentials in carry on. In case of missed connection, whilst you could technically get your bag out, it takes a ton of extra time. And in case the bag is delayed.

Credit is issued essentially issued the moment they the flight is canceled. Sometimes it's a manual process, usually when processing through the airline it's automatic.

"I'm now Medicine-Pilled after Asia USA resident here, I recently finished a month long solo trip to SEA. I stayed with a friend in north Thailand for a week, then skedaddled off to Bangkok for another week. While in Bangkok I guess something I ate was funky as shortly after I got to my next destination, Vietnam, I wasn't feeling too hot.

This is where my Vietnamese healthcare journey began.

I went to a doctor's office I found on google maps (just rode a scooter up in front of the building and walked in) and using the classic google translate, I laid out my intentions to the nurse at the front desk. He called the doctor immediately, the doctor talked to me on the phone and asked me to wait 10 minutes, and there he was! I explained what happened and he ran 10 blood tests on me for about $50. Now keep in mind this is actually ripping me off and I sort of figured that, but decided not to haggle because it was so cheap compared to any US offer. They took my blood sample then and there and I had my results in a 3 days.

Here's where it gets crazier (at least to me)! At this point, I was in Hanoi, and the doctor sent me a prescription on WhatsApp, and I just walked to a pharmacy, showed them the list, and they got the three medications out for me. I was waiting for it, the big cost, my punishment for not properly checking my food... the cost was $4? I was astonished but paid, and checked the price of my own prescription medication from the US (it was available over the counter in Vietnam) and it was similarly priced at a few dollars for the same amount of pills, with some of the price differences being over 95% cheaper.

Regardless of that I pressed on with my adventure and was in the mountains of Vietnam, and of course I'm paranoid so I'm still researching my symptoms and realize that the doctor I had seen hadn't tested for a certain infection. I wanted that infection tested for, so I went to a private clinic and they did a rapid test for about $2, and they then directed me to a regional hospital who had more options for testing. Well the regional hospital staff were charging me an entrance fee as a foreigner, and it was pretty obvious that Vietnamese citizens were simply walking in. Whatever, when in Rome. I was expecting a big kabuki dance to see a doctor but after paying $6... I was walked to an available doctor and we were communicating with a bit of English? It was surprising to me as I wasn't expecting this level of expediency from an otherwise chaotic-seeming regional hospital.

The doctor at the hospital understands I want a PCR test (the latest and greatest and most accurate form of blood testing afaik) and said I needed to see the National Disease and Epidemiology center in Hanoi. Well it's convenient that I was heading back to Hanoi the next day, so I booked an airbnb next to that building, and made a plan. The next afternoon, I walk into this lovely compound that looks nothing like a medical facility, and after once again using a prepared translation of my situation, some security guards directed me to a corner building, where a woman greeted me, talked to me in a similar fashion, and introduced me to a doctor in a different building. After walking down these rustic halls, she and a nurse unlock a door, and all of a sudden we're surrounded by a mass of state of the art monitoring machines, centrifuges, and beeping sounds!

At this point I was getting a bit terrified of the fact that I might have overreacted and was about to have to bite the bullet that hubris had led me to get an extremely expensive lab procedure completed. But after talking to this new doctor, she explained that while they normally get their blood samples from the hospital to work with, she could just take my sample there. So they did. And when I asked the price? Free. FREE. F R E E.

And the very next day I got my results back: negative. I was fearmongering to the extreme but you know what? In hindsight, the vast amount of perception on how healthcare works in Vietnam was worth the discomfort as it greatly broadened my perspective.

All in all I think that in the USA, it would have probably taken me several weeks of waiting, complying with ridiculous office hours, arguing my way through several uncaring secretaries, and having doctors schedule things too far apart for any level of expediency after not taking my explanations into account anyways. Oh yeah, and without insurance, it would have probably cost me anywhere from several hundred to over a thousand dollars depending on how the prices are set.

But instead, in Vietnam, I was able to get my medical needs taken care of the day that I wanted them looked at basically, all for... less than $60 total for all combined medical costs. And if I repeated the process knowing what I know now? I would have haggled the price of the blood tests down to $25 because that is very doable in Vietnam and SEA in general (I could write a whole entire post on why I love that alone but I think it's a commonly shared sentiment).

Another example of this is I had a friend who's boyfriend has a condition called Hashimoto's disease. His pills are $865 for 30 pills (his insurance covers it but it's still several hundred dollars per month to them). I walked to a pharmacy and asked a pharmacist for the exact same medication his insurance paid for. $2. 100 pills. At this point I was determined that medical tourism will always be a route I will consider and recommend other people consider because there are simply no excuses when it comes to things like this that gets denied in certain Western societies.

Now this isn't to say that Vietnam or any SEA country has a perfect healthcare system. I'm polite, I learn some of the language, I'm generally very good at getting along with others and playing the foreigner card right, which often times lets me land unique opportunities, such as walking into a national hospital ranked in the top 10 in Asia for their specialty and getting seen instantly. I can't say that the average Vietnamese person would be able to travel to Hanoi just oh-so conveniently like I was (it's an interesting conversation you could have, claiming they can and can't at the same time).

The general lack of restrictions on over the counter antibiotics has caused some bacterial strains to have incredible resistance to them, and makes them all the more deadly to those that do get them. It also leads to a lot of problems going improperly treated because self diagnosis is common, and the most powerful and extreme measures are often done first, which might not be proper.

I can't really speak on how the government actually intersected with the healthcare, I'm sure there's much more nuance than I could have seen going on behind the scenes and that I will definitely remember to ask about next time I visit, just because I find this to be such an interesting topic now.

So yeah, I took the Asia pill when it came to medicine. And it's not like it was like this just in Vietnam, when I lived in Korea previously, McDonald's workers could go to the doctor and not feel financially pressured at all. That's the goal: For everyone to be able to receive quality, expedient care without financial pressure for most cases.

Adding this in hindsight, but it's insane that I was able to navigate that by myself by just going to a few places because there weren't any of the normal healthcare hoops that I'm used to having to jump through.

TL/DR: Vietnamese healthcare was so fast and affordable I had a medical epiphany.",post,r/solotravel,Travel,503.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1ku2iim/im_now_medicinepilled_after_asia/
"As a Vietnamese American, I have mixed feelings reading this.

I’m glad you had a good experience with Vietnam’s healthcare system and recognized how affordable it can be, especially compared to the U.S. But also your tone drips with tourist privilege.

You got access and special treatment partly because you’re a foreigner with money, time, and the flexibility to move around. Something that many locals especially rural or lower-income Vietnamese, don’t have. You casually mention how you could have haggled down the price of blood tests (which already underpays doctors and staff), or how you walked into national hospitals and were seen quickly but the average Vietnamese person might wait much longer, deal with underfunded local clinics, or avoid care altogether because even $6 can be a burden for them.

The fact that meds are cheaper in Vietnam is less about some magic “Asia pill” and more about the predatory pricing of U.S. pharma and insurance.

It’s great you had an eye opening experience, but maybe next time, reflect a bit more on why things worked the way they did for you and what local people’s reality looks like.",comment_1,r/solotravel,Travel,,https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1ku2iim/im_now_medicinepilled_after_asia/
"So your takeaway from this great experience was that you would haggle about the price of the blood tests next time. Got it. The only place where you should be haggling is some tourist trap T-shirt seller, not a hospital.",comment_2,r/solotravel,Travel,,https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1ku2iim/im_now_medicinepilled_after_asia/
You mentioned the pills for Hashimato tyroid syndrome in US is $865? For 30 pills? I’m guessing the pill is Euthrox. 5€ for 100 pills in Germany and 3-4€ in Turkey. Man you guys are being f.ed by US pharma/insurance lobby or whatever you call’em,comment_3,r/solotravel,Travel,,https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1ku2iim/im_now_medicinepilled_after_asia/
">I'm polite, I learn some of the language, I'm generally very good at getting along with others and playing the foreigner card right, which often times lets me land unique opportunities, such as walking into a national hospital ranked in the top 10 in Asia for their specialty and getting seen instantly.

"Solo travel - restaurant frustrations! I’m just beginning to solo travel and have run into 2 trends that I’d like to manage better. One, I asked the hotel to make a rooftop restaurant reservation in one of three restaurants at a flexible time.   They responded that the restaurants won’t make reservations for one.     Two, I went to a lovely restaurant and they sat me at a table that was substandard.   I argued, and they said all the other tables were reserved.    No one sat at them the whole time I was scrunched in with the plants, and only half had “reserved” signs on them. 

How do you handle these issues? Are they common?",post,r/solotravel,Travel,62.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1ku8wjh/solo_travel_restaurant_frustrations/

Personally I've never had an issue eating by myself, although I always expect to get one of the worst tables / seats, or depending on country, be sat at a shared table.

Sounds like in your first instance, maybe your hotel was just being lazy and giving you an excuse for them not to do it?

"Itinerary suggestions: ~8hrs in Lille, France Hi all, first-time poster so if there's a better sub for this question I'd appreciate a redirection!

I'll be on a weekday visit to Lille for the day at the start of June (arriving \~9:30am CET, back at the station \~7pm CET) but it's not looking like there's much to do. The belfry tour has sold out, so I've messaged Cathédrale Notre-Dame de la Treille to see if I can get a tour of the crypt, if not then I'll just have a casual look inside the church... but besides that, I have nothing.

I recently did a trip to Belgium (my first EVER solo trip!) and managed to get some of the touristy bits of Ghent and Brussels out the way in about 7hrs. In Ghent I did the canal tour, took pics outside the cathedrals/castles, got waffles and chocolates to bring back home; then in Brussels I saw 2 of the three Pis statues, Grand Place, Galleries Royales Saint-Hubert, Mont Des Arts, artwork across the city, and got some souvenirs to bring back home so I'm looking for a similar vibe.

I'd really like to get some breakfast in and maybe lunch too? I'm a bit of a foodie but I was too nervous to eat in Belgium so I wanna make up for it now! I've got plans to visit Meert for the waffles, and to get merveilleux from Aux Merveilleux de Fred, but I'm just struggling to find somewhere nice for breakfast and lunch. Only requirement really is that I'm vegetarian.

Any suggestions will help massively! I really want to make it special as it'll be my last trip out of the UK for the rest of the year and I got some really good news this week so I want to kinda make this a celebration trip now!",post,r/solotravel,Travel,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1kus1nb/itinerary_suggestions_8hrs_in_lille_france/
"Hostel world booking was charged completely but still says “payable upon arrival” I booked a hostel one month in advance. Total price was 180€. Before booking, it said that 27€ will be charged and the rest (154€) is payable upon arrival. 

However, after booking both the 27€ and 154€ were charged from my card in 2 separate payments. The 27€ was charged by Hostelworld and the 154€ was charged by the hostel. 

But on the Hostelworld app it still says (total paid: 27€ and payable upon arrival 154€) despite the 154€ being charged already.

"Just a youngster looking for guidance. Not sure where to post this, or what to title it. I’ve posted here before, this time it’s about loneliness as a 22 year old guy.

I’m an adventurous soul, I can’t stay put for very long, and I always want to see new things and meet new people. So that’s what i’m doing. I’m partially pursuing a career, while taking time to wander the country, seeing old friends and places i’ve heard about. Im exploring the south and it’s been rad. 

Here’s the thing, I have no community, all of my friends are scattered at different colleges, when I visit it’s fun but I feel like an outsider. I’m about half introvert, half extrovert, so being alone 99% of the time isn’t so bad, but it gets old. Everywhere I go, I see couples and families, and it makes me miss having people to hang with. I’m at a crossroads of wanting to find a cool city, get an apartment and a job, and build a friend group and perhaps meet a cool gal. But I also know that within 6 months i’m gonna have the intense urge to hit the road and go wander. It’s a tricky part of me that I inherited from my dad, and it’s a curse in many ways. I dropped out of school because I couldn’t be there any longer, I needed to experience other places. But the more I travel, the lonelier I get. “Meet friends on the road!” Is many people response, but that isn’t easy to do, at least for lasting friendships. 

I’ve thought about getting overseas when I get the cash, as I know the solo traveling culture is bigger and there’s tons of people at hostels and such. America is pretty isolating most of the time. My hometown sucks, and I don’t enjoy going back, but I have an awesome family there. 

Anyway, thanks for reading. If you have any personal experience with this or some advice, that’d be super appreciated.",post,r/solotravel,Travel,2.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1kulfhg/just_a_youngster_looking_for_guidance/

"Ugh this hits so close to home! My friend went through basically the exact same thing around your age, that wanderlust is such a double-edged sword. Have you looked into seasonal work at all, like ski resorts or summer camps or workaway programs? The constant need to move might settle down as you get older too, my friend is 27 now and she's found a good rhythm with remote work and staying places for 3-6 months at a time instead of constantly being on the move. You're definitely not weird for feeling this way though",comment_2,r/solotravel,Travel,,https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1kulfhg/just_a_youngster_looking_for_guidance/
"I would suggest getting yourself a good CouchSurfing dot org profile. Learn the process of how to request a couch to sleep on. I have met a ton of great people while also traveling on-the-cheap this way.  
  
Getting a commercial driver's license may be a good fit. You can travel the country and so long as you're comfortable getting out of the truck and using busses, trains and taxis there's a ton of cool stuff to see while out on the road. I got out of that life because of the negative effects of being away from friends, but I really got to see a lot of great stuff. In a perfect world I'd drive a truck during warm months and take a three-month vacation to the southern hemisphere (where it's summer-time) during the rest of the year.

If you're going full train-hopping and rainbow-gathering that's a whole different world, but maybe it's a good fit for you.

As for friendships I like to use Discord and postcards to stay in touch with old friends. Feel free to drop me a line and I would be happy to share my Discord ID if you ever want to just chat from time to time.

Good luck out there.",comment_3,r/solotravel,Travel,,https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1kulfhg/just_a_youngster_looking_for_guidance/
"I’ve never been to the U.S. but I can definitely relate. I started travelling at 18 and do shorter trips every years for a month to 3 months at a time and even then it made me feel sort of isolated not only from my home community but also the people I’ve met on the road. There are so many people I’ve met abroad that I wish I could just capture and put into a little village and we’d all live super fun lives just hanging out, but that’s not going to happen!

I make it a point to go see them whenever I can, but it’s tough when they’re like a 12 hour flight away, etc. One thing that has really helped me is learning to truly stay present whenever I’m with friends, and just being there and not expecting anything more. Usually we’re anxious because we think about the future too much, but all that does is just make us miss the present - which is always happening right now.

I can’t say how your life will turn out. I’m on month 11 now being away from home and definitely feel a little bit like I have no more roots left at all, though I still keep in touch with people I’ve met on the road and back home, it’s just not the same. But this is the life I chose and I wouldn’t trade it for anything else. This is also probably the reason why I’m perpetually single, I can’t commit to anything, but I’m having a blast.

Just remember that we can always make choices, and sometimes we have to try stuff to make sure it is or isn’t for us. I’ve stayed put at home for over a year last year but had the real urge to just leave and so I did, and it’s been a blast!

Truth is, we can’t ever have everything, but we can always be content with what we have at any given time, and if we want something else, well we can go do that. I’m not gonna be like ‘oh you’re still young’ or whatever because that doesn’t help anything, but what you do have is time to figure things out as you go! Take it easy, enjoy what life is, in time you’ll learn things about yourself and you can take it from there. You’re more than capable, mate! Trust yourself :D

And yeah, go international when you can, it’s a whole different world out there full of people just waiting to meet you! Take care G!",comment_4,r/solotravel,Travel,,https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1kulfhg/just_a_youngster_looking_for_guidance/
"Seeking SEA advice on 2 week itinerary I am lucky to have a 1 month sabbatical to rest and recover from work. I am spending 2 weeks of it with friends and family in Japan before they head back. After that I have 15 days October 26th - Nov 9th by myself to explore starting in **Tokyo**. I figure since I am already in the area I should explore asia and take advantage of cheaper 1 way flights. I wanted to get some itinerary advice.

**Ideally** I am looking for places with interesting culture, food, and nature day trips. Would like to do **nonstop** flights between cities. I must return to Pittsburgh on the 9th and would ideally like to end up in a city with a 1 stop flight back home (which is why I picked Taipei)

Manila just isn't worth it, for what you are looking for.

This trip report aims to provide a high level overview of my journey, focussing on context and key takeaways. Hopefully this can be of some insight or help to anyone considering something similar. Naturally I can’t cover every country or aspect of travel in detail here, so if you’re curious about anything or had questions, please comment and I’ll respond! Aiming to go into more detail, breakdowns and countries in future.

#####1. About
I travelled non-stop around the world from July 2023 – December 2024. I travelled for a total of 532 days, visiting 7 continents and ~65 countries.

[Itinerary and locations visited.](https://worldli.substack.com/p/itinerary-round-the-world)

Very short trip summary in comments.

**About me**

27M (25 start of trip). It was always my lifelong dream to travel around the world and to do so as literally as possible. Meant to do this trip when I graduated university, but that’s when COVID hit. Waited patiently for 3 years before I quit my job, bought a one-way ticket to LA, and followed the map until I reached home.

**Travel style**

Easygoing, curious and like to try new things. A travel buddy described it as “open-minded, like to connect with others, and into local culture”. Mostly, I went with the flow and took opportunities as they came, and ended up with a great mix of nature, culture, food and party. The only thing I made sure to do in every city was try any local specialities.

I am not a morning person, but forced to be one to catch cheap early flights. Overall, this was very budget travel with occasional splurges. This meant staying in the cheapest hostels, having the cheapest meals, and using public/shared transport wherever possible. I didn’t have money, but I had time and a willingness to put myself through admin logistical hell.

Hot take – walking tours are overrated and I stopped doing them after the first few.

I also like to think I’ve permanently added an extra day to my life, since I never had to lose a day after gaining one :)


#####2. Big 3 - Transport, Accomodation, Food


**Transport**


Plane: 63 | Bus: 40 | Train: 23 | Van/Car: 16 | Boat: 5 | Lando: 1

(as a means of shifting cities/trips. Does not include day trips, public transport or rideshare/taxis)

I considered all transport options when moving place to place and usually went for the cheapest option. This led to many long haul bus rides (record stands at 28h). Tip: limit water intake so you don’t need to use the bathroom.


**Accommodation**

Couch: 197 | Hostel: 139 | Shared private: 120 | Camping: 42 | Solo private: 16 | Transport: 18

I consider myself extremely lucky to have friends who were generous enough to host me. I also couchsurfed with complete strangers (through the couchsurfing app). I am forever grateful for those 197 nights. Every time I crashed someone’s couch, I wasn’t just welcomed into their homes but also into their lives. Had some very local, unique and unforgettable experiences I wouldn’t have had otherwise

Crashing couches also significantly reduced costs. I like to buy gifts or treat hosts to meals, so some accommodation costs may be reflected in my food/gifts budget. I also ended up traveling with others a fair bit, and splitting the cost of a private was often on par with/more affordable than a hostel.

**Food**

Eating out: 90% | Cooking: 10%

I ate out 90% of the time, and generally ate 2 meals per day. I developed a sixth sense in finding the cheapest but best tasting spots in any given city. Trying new food is a huge part of my travels and I can’t cook – so 2 birds 1 stone. Though, I was forced to stretch my culinary skills at times for the sake of budget.

#####3. Budget

Total cost: ~$68,000AUD (45,000USD)

This amount covers all expenses, including pre-trip costs such as passport and vaccinations. I initially budgeted $50,000AUD for 1 year of travel and aimed for an average daily spend of $100. I decided to dip into my emergency savings (~$20,000) to extend the trip. The $100 per day estimate was based on prior research, however most of that travel information was pre-covid. Since then, inflation has not been kind - e.g. restaurant prices being double what menus showed just 2-3 years ago when I checked on Google Maps. Plus, the Aussie dollar was consistently letting me down. Given that, I’m pretty content with how my average daily spend turned out.

**Budget Breakdown (approximate)**

Flights: $10.5k

Food: $9.5k

Accommodation: $7.2k

Transport: $5.5k

Activities: $5.2k

Alcohol/Party: $3.6k

Discretionary: $3k

Ancillary costs: $1k

Passport/Visas: $1.6k

Health: $2k

Gifts: $1.6k

Antarctica: $10k

Africa overland (tour): $5.2k

Northwest US road trip: $1k

*Discretionary costs cover expenses which I bought as a “want” – i.e. clothes, souvenirs, tattoos, etc. Ancillary costs cover things like SIM cards and exchange fees.*


#####4. Pack
My journey was carry-on only and there were zero instances where I checked in my bag, notwithstanding the fact that it weighed ~12kg. I had an Osprey Farpoint 40L, a bum bag, and a packable daypack.

My pack underwent a lot of changes over the 18 months (naturally), as I binned/donated/sent back some items and took on others. Overtime my pack became a lot more functional than fashionable. You would have never caught me dead in cargo pants before this trip, but by the end, the only bottoms I owned were detachable 2-in-1 cargos that converted into shorts. I intend to do a deeper pack breakdown, but here are the key takeaways:

**Essentials**

- Passport/Important Documents/Phone/Meds
- Noise cancelling earphones
- Shower slippers
- Sleeping Eye Mask/Ear Plugs
- Carabiners/Hero Clip
- Travel adapter
- Non-TSA lock

**Nice to haves**

- Airtags
- Inflatable pillow (didn’t realise how good this was until I got one)
- Quick dry clothing
- Dry bag
- Portable clothes line
- Portable mini fan
- Travel towel
- Raincoat/bag cover
- Duct tape

#####7. Advice

**Tips**

- *No plan is the best plan* – most of my favourite travel moments were unexpected, and only possible due to my absent planning. Some of my biggest regrets were passing up opportunities because I’d already committed to other plans. The longer your travels the less planning you should do.

- *Travel carry-on* – cheaper transport, less stuff to worry about, and no risk of lost luggage.

- *Manage burnout* – long term travel is no vacation. Constantly being on the move is exhausting. Planning and logistics were the bane of my existence. It’s OK to slow down, have a Netflix day, or just stay put for a while.

- *It’s OK to not do everything* – I often felt the need to see or do something purely because it was listed as a “top thing to do in x”. It’s much better to allocate your time, energy and money on things you genuinely want to do.

- *Leave your comfort zone* – most of my favourite experiences came from doing something I was hesitant to at first (subtle difference vs not being interested).

- *“hello” & “thank you”* – learn these in whatever country you’re in and your experience will increase tenfold.

- *Wear shower slippers* – I shouldn’t even have to put this here, but I’ve met people who rawdog communal showers, and that might be one of the scariest things I’ve encountered this trip.

- *Walk* – as a means of transport. Saves money, no hassle with public transport, and is a great way to see a place.

- *Keep a private daily log* – I kept a journal on my phone, jotting down what happened each day and how I was feeling. Some entries short, others longer if I had more energy, but I’m glad I kept it up. Reading those notes can take you right back to those moments. I suggest keeping it private as it’s a good way to be honest with yourself.

- *Keep a shared journal/record* – a few months into my trip, I was gifted this notebook which I’d use to ask people I met along the way to add something to (write/draw/life advice/anything). It’s nice to look back on those messages and memories. I’ve seen other versions too, e.g. a playlist where everyone adds a song.

- *Document everything* – I try not to have any regrets, but not documenting enough might be one of them. I wish I took more photos/videos/notes.

- *Check for bed bugs* – only takes a minute and saves you from a travel nightmare.

- *Safety* – share your location with people you trust, exercise common sense (don’t walk alone at night, don’t get too drunk), exercise proper precautions.

- *Don’t go to Japan or China during summer.*

**Budget Tips**

- Hostels > hotels. Not only cheaper, but it’s a great way to meet people, more helpful in terms of tips and local guidance, and honestly safer. Just make sure you pick a good one.

- Get a travel towel so you never have to rent one (even though they’re pretty cheap to rent anyway).

- I generally hand washed everything if I didn’t have access to a (free) washing machine. Especially since I packed light so I didn’t have many clothes in the first place. Would either wash it in the shower or dry bag.

- Look into credit card churning and how to utilise frequent flyer points. Most offer complimentary travel insurance (side note: mine expired after a year, I then decided that risking my life was worth saving $800 – do not do this).

- Stay longer in cheaper regions.

- Move around less.

- Bring your student ID for discounts (even if you’ve graduated, if it doesn’t have an expiry date, it’s worth a shot).

- Eat at local places – it’s a much better culinary, cultural and financial experience. University areas are usually cheaper.

**General**

- *People are kind* - and much more open and warmer than western corporate life.

- *Trust your gut* - somehow your instincts just know.

- *Trust that you can figure it out.*

- *Goodbyes don’t get easier.*

- *Shared experiences are best* – solo travelling can be liberating, but sharing those moments make them better.

- *Gain perspective* – e.g. trying to navigate Latin America (cheaply) for 6 months with zero Spanish made me appreciate how challenging it must be for immigrants starting fresh in a new country – something I’d never truly understood as a native English speaker.

- *Money solves a lot of problems*, but lacking that, it can be solved with time, energy and inconvenience.

- *The world is big* – with so so so much more out there beyond your hometown and social circle (how could you not want to see and experience it all!?!?).

- *The world is small* – everything and everyone is only a bus/train/plane ticket away. You never know who you’ll bump into even in the unlikeliest of places.

#####8. Closing thoughts
Looking back at the past 18 months, the whole thing feels like a movie. It’s a very weird and bittersweet feeling. It’s hard to believe I was living out of a backpack and travelling the world just a year ago. Now, being back home and back in corporate, it feels like stepping into a completely different life.

Catching up with friends, I’d answer questions and give broad highlights before conversation moved elsewhere. Of course everyone is amazed and interested in your travels, but if we’re being honest, unless they’re as into travel as you are, most don’t care or “get it”. So it is pretty weird having these experiences, only to come back and feel that disconnect. I guess that’s the downside/weird thing about solo travel - these experiences and memories are yours and yours alone. That’s partly why I enjoy travelling with others too; it’s like there’s someone else there to validate what you went through.

Despite the above, which is just me venting post travel depression, I have zero regrets and it truly was the trip of a lifetime. While I can rave about all the amazing places and incredible meals, the best part of the trip was 100% the people. If you’re in this sub and reading this trip report, you must be interested in travelling, and I can 100% recommend.",post,r/solotravel,Travel,194.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1ktisuj/rtw_trip_report_532_days_7_continents_65_countries/
"**Very short trip summary:**

**North America:** I kicked off this journey at a country I am very familiar with, that being the god blessed land of USA. During university, I completed an exchange semester in America so I was very much looking forward to catching up with friends that I hadn’t seen in years and ordering some chic-fil-a. I also figured it was the best way to ease into my travels, since I’m familiar with the country, it’s English speaking, and it was basically one big reunion. I think I managed to visit 12-15 states over the span of 1.5 months. Managed to sneak in a quick 6 day trip to Toronto.

**Latin America:** I ended my USA (+ Canada) leg in NYC, subsequently flying from Newark to Mexico City. This would kick off the beginning of my “real travel”, where I was proper backpacking and staying in hostel dorms. From Mexico, I made my way all the way down to Argentina where I then took a cruise to Antarctica and back. This was probably the portion of the trip where I was in my most backpacker/homeless like state and usually booking things night before/day of. My hair was growing longer, I was wearing bracelets, and I was on a consistent diet of rice and beans. I spent roughly 6 months in Latin America. My first reaction upon landing in Mexico was f\*\*\* I need to learn Spanish. I didn’t take any Spanish lessons, but spending so much time in Latin America and actively trying to converse and navigate the region forced me to pick it up. By the end of those 6 months I knew enough Spanish for travel and friend purposes which was a very pleasant surprise.

**Africa**: The next logical step after South America was to continue my journey eastwards, bringing me to all of our’s collective motherland. I started in Johannesburg where I was staying with a couchsurfing host who ran a BnB business, and my fellow paying guests were apparently diamond dealers. I then made my way up to Kenya via overland tour. It was a massive relief to not have to plan for 4 weeks, and despite sleeping with bugs, sporadic showers and being bitten alive by mozzies, the people I met and wildlife was amazing.

**Middle East**: Following Africa, I quickly made my way through Qatar and Jordan to enter Turkey. I wish I had spent more time exploring the Middle East, but most Middle Eastern countries were either too expensive or presented too much visa difficulty. I visited Jordan at the beginning of 2024, so there weren’t a lot of tourists. Nevertheless, I felt completely safe and it was nice to explore Petra without the usual tourist crowd. I did get stranded in Jordan when I “hitchhiked” my way to the Dead Sea and was just dropped off at a random spot. Luckily I bumped into a group of older travellers (50+) who took me under their wing for the next 2 days before I made my own way down to Petra.

**Europe**: From Turkey, I launched into Europe and completed my Euro Spring. It was very nice to be back in the western hemisphere and more modern touristy destinations, though that novelty quickly wore off. While I was used to cheap and great hostels in Latin America (mostly), hostels in Europe felt soulless and too expensive for what it was. Fortunately I had/made a lot of European friends who I ended up visiting/crashing with. I spent about 2 months in Central/Western Europe, and 1 month in Eastern Europe/Balkans. It was definitely nice catching up with friends that I had made during the earlier legs of my trip and seeing them again.

**Asia**: From Eastern Europe, I flew to Azerbaijan (not much to see) and then into Kazakhstan and Mongolia. I then launched my way into East Asia and South East Asia for the remaining 6 months of my trip. I basically ate my way through Asia and continued catching up with friends and seeing unbelievable sights. At this point, it had been over a year since I had any good Asian food, and my excitement and anticipation was immeasurable.

**Australia**: Before returning back home, I visited Perth for the first time and went skydiving and saw quokkas. 10/10.",comment_1,r/solotravel,Travel,,https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1ktisuj/rtw_trip_report_532_days_7_continents_65_countries/

"SE Asia Itinerary feedback Just looking for feedback on my itinerary. I(27M) will be traveling mostly solo to SE Asia(Thailand, Laos, and Cambodia) for the first time this July and August. I’ve traveled a good amount, but this will be my first time in the region. I will be flying into and out of Bangkok July 2nd-August 17th. I’m writing this with the intention of it being a flexible plan(subtract a day here, add a day there, etc).  In terms of interests, I'm looking for a well rounded trip. I like history/cultural stuff, nature, diving, and food. I typically stay at hostels and love a social hostel with events that aren’t just bar crawls. I have mixed opinions about party hostels, I've been to some that I love and some that I hate.General feedback would be great but I have a few specific questions.

1. Am I spending enough time in Bangkok? Seems like a city with a lot to do that generates mixed opinions. With my current plan, I will likely spend 1 night at the start of my trip solo, 2 nights there with some friends, and 1 night at the end before I fly home.

2. If you were to add an extra day to either Pai or Vang Vieng(subtracted from a day in Koh Tao) which would you do? Would you do both?

3. When doing the slowboat from Chiang Rai-Luang Prabang should I get to Huay Xai the night before or the morning of? I really don’t want to be without a seat for many hours. Or should I splurge on a private boat? It seems like the private boats only leave a few days per week. Also, should I book a bundle ticket through Getyourguide or should I do it through a hostel/tour company on the ground?

4. Do I need more than 1 day in Chiang Rai? Currently planning on 1.5 or 2 before doing the Slow Boat to Luang Prabang.

5. Where should I go for my last week? Would love a beachy place that I can easily get back to Bangkok from.

"I’m over a week into my SEA trip. Each place I’ve booked tours by going to the tour stands that are everywhere. There are multiple prices. The price online is similar to the price on the brochure they give you. They’ll often say “but I can give it to you for X”. You counter back with a lower price, they will usually give a price somewhere in the middle. It helps if you’re booking it for the next day, because they want to fill it up. Most of the tours in these places are very similar so you can hop around. 

When researching my trip, I had planned to do two full day tours and one half day. I budgeted based on prices from Tripadvisor and GetYourGuide. I didn’t really use Klook but I’ve doublechecked and I still saved money off their price. By negotiating in person, I did four full day tours and a half day tour, and I went over budget by $5 😅

I was initially worried about availability for the activities I wanted to do but I’m a basic bitch and they’re popular enough that there’s plenty available.",comment_3,r/solotravel,Travel,,https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1kud8y4/where_are_folks_booking_toursactivites_during/

"2025 Solo Bogotá Trip Report   
Hey everyone! I just got back from a solo trip to Bogotá, Colombia for 7 days, and wanted to share some thoughts in case you're planning to go or are concerned about safety.  
  
**1. Safety:**  
The danger is often overblown if you stick to tourist-friendly areas. I dressed simply (jeans, T-shirts, no jewelry), stayed in safe neighborhoods, and walked around at night without issues. That said, common sense goes a long way—don’t flash your phone, speak loudly in English, or look like a lost tourist. I recommend using a local guide app like Showaround to explore more confidently. “No dar papaya” definitely applies. If it's extremely late at night take an Uber, they are very affordable here and it's not worth taking the risk. The only time I was ""robbed"" was by a local laundry store that charged me  gringo pricing. Everyone else charged me fair pricing for whatever I was buying, which I appreciated. I gave or tipped them more as well to show my appreciation and be respectful.

**2. Culture & History:**  
Bogotá really shines here! I visited the Gold Museum, Monserrate, and La Candelaria. There’s a rich mix of history, architecture, and even various kinds of birds. If you approach the culture with curiosity and respect, people will usually respond positively.

**3. Language:**  
I’ve been studying Spanish for a few months (around A1–A2 level), and while I struggled with conversations, some locals were patient and even helped me practice, which I appreciated a lot.

**4. Food:**  
Absolutely delicious—10/10! Arepas, ajiaco, tacos, Colombian sweets, and drinks like coconut lemonade were all great. Highly recommend trying as much local food as possible, won't regret it!

**5. Friendliness:**  
This part was a mixed bag. A lot of interactions felt polite but impersonal or forced, especially in shops and even in my hotel. Some people ignored my greetings even when we made eye contact and clearly heard me. That said, the truly friendly locals I met were *incredibly* warm—asking where I was from (Texas), welcoming me, and showing genuine curiosity about the U.S., even though I was more interested in learning about the Colombian culture and history. However, those moments stood out and made the trip even more special.

6. Would I go back: Maybe, but only to leave for other cities in Colombia. Bogotá didn’t feel as welcoming as other places I’ve traveled, and the “you don’t belong here” vibe got tiring. That said, I’m still very glad I went. It was a valuable, eye-opening trip.",post,r/solotravel,Travel,23.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1ktvkp2/2025_solo_bogotá_trip_report/

"Would you consider it safe to set up your phone on a tripod in European cities? I'll be travelling solo in Denmark (mainly Copenhagen) in a few weeks' time. I really love taking photos so I want to commemorate my trip, but since i’m going alone, I don’t know how I can do this except to set up a tripod. Now the thing is, my phone is super important because if it somehow gets snatched, I will have no way to actually get anywhere because I rely on it for, well, everything. So I was just wondering how safe you’d consider it to set it up on a tripod, especially in touristy places. I am from a super safe city in asia and it’s my first time going to europe alone so I’m not really sure if I should rely on my compromised sense of spatial awareness and alertness towards potentially sus behaviour lol.

"Trip report: India Hi everyone,

I’d like to share my experience from a solo trip to India, which I took in September 2024.
I had been mentally preparing for this journey for several years, and I must say that I was surprised at every turn. I traveled from Jaipur to Agra, then to Gwalior, and finished my trip in Delhi. I spent around 11 days exploring these cities, using only tuk-tuks, trains, and walking—I walked over 200 kilometers! I planned most of the trip with the help of ChatGPT and by asking fellow travelers for recommendations.

I flew from Dubai to Jaipur and, as a solo European guy on a fully booked flight, I definitely stood out—some people did a triple take when they saw me, which was pretty funny. I arrived at Jaipur airport around 4 AM, and security staff unexpectedly escorted me straight to passport and visa control.

That morning, my walking journey across the city began.
Jaipur, also known as the ""Amber City,"" is beautiful but incredibly dirty—a fact I later realized is fairly standard across many Indian cities. Most people I met tried to lure me into their jewelry shops, workshops, or clothing stores. Walking through the city and its slums was fascinating, with countless places worth visiting.

One memorable moment happened when a random tuk-tuk driver—let’s call him Srini—stopped and offered me a free ride, saying he just wanted to chat. Eventually, he invited me to his home. It was hard to refuse such a unique opportunity, so I agreed. I got a firsthand look at daily life in the slums—a truly eye-opening experience. Navigating the maze-like alleys was surreal. His ""house"" was a small 3x3m room, housing an unknown number of people.

Srini then called over his kids, who brought out musical instruments and began playing Indian music and singing. It was enjoyable—until they started asking for money. Specifically, they asked for 3000 rupees to buy a small sound system to support their musical ambitions. I declined several times, and eventually, Srini accepted it and took me back to the city. I gave him around 300 rupees and said goodbye.

Later, I booked a local guide via Showaround. It was a good experience, although, as expected, he took me to his family’s clothing store. We explored the city on his motorcycle, which was fun—until I made a rookie mistake. When getting off the bike, I accidentally burned my calf badly on the exhaust pipe. To this day, I have a 6 cm scar as a souvenir.

A few days later, I arrived in Agra—a city clearly geared toward tourists, for good reason. The Taj Mahal is absolutely breathtaking. I highly recommend arriving at opening time to avoid the crowds. After three hours there, I searched for good viewpoints on Google Maps. On my way back from one of them, I took what looked like a shortcut through a residential area. That turned out to be a mistake.

A man with bloodshot eyes and a machete blocked my path and demanded 300 rupees to cross his land. I paid without hesitation. The next day, while walking through other parts of Agra, I saw people living in conditions worse than anything I’d ever witnessed—like animals. Tuk-tuk drivers were begging to give rides for as little as 10 rupees. In front of the Agra Fort, official guides started at 1500 rupees and dropped to 200 by the time I walked away. It was quite a scene.

Next, I arrived in Gwalior—a beautiful and underrated city. There’s an impressive hilltop fort with several temples, where you’re free to roam. I also visited the Gurudwara Data Bandi Chhod Sahib. Don’t hesitate to go inside—it was a once-in-a-lifetime experience. After visiting the temple, I was offered a simple but delicious free meal. Later in the local market, I bought some handmade metal dishes.

That same day, I saw a dead body covered in flies on the street, and no one seemed to care.

The final five days of my trip were spent in Delhi. I was surprised by how clean the city center was—but beyond that, daily life looked very different. In my opinion, more than two days in Delhi isn't necessary.

Some useful tips:

Language:
I was genuinely surprised by how many people spoke English fluently and were easy to understand.

Prices:
They vary depending on your skin color and language skills. As a Czech traveler, I was always quoted the highest prices. For example, the entrance to the Taj Mahal cost me 1100 rupees, while locals paid only 50.

Transportation:
I used Uber everywhere. For trains, the IRCTC website worked well, though verifying your account requires patience.

Street Food:
It depends on your gut—I ate street food almost daily and had no issues.

Internet:
I bought an eSIM via the Airalo app. It worked perfectly throughout the trip.

Common scams and things to watch out for:

Jewelry shops pretending to offer ""free tours""

Clothing stores with aggressive upselling

Tuk-tuk/Uber drivers lying about blocked accounts or demanding cash after the payment via card

Fake charity donations (blind children, etc.)

Claims about closed attractions to reroute you

Agra – Mehtab Bagh: for the best photo, go straight to the ""Taj View Point ADA""

Overpriced official tour guides

Fake hotel/hostel photos on Booking.com – always verify via Google Maps

Overly friendly strangers – they usually have an agenda",post,r/solotravel,Travel,132.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1ktdqgc/trip_report_india/

lol come on now. For the Taj Mahal or other attractions it has nothing to do with skin color or language. It's just the official prices set by the government for locals vs foreigners, which obviously aren't negotiable. You can easily buy the tickets online too.

Also, a lot of the sites have official prices for tour guides listed on a sign by the entrance. Of the top of my head I saw them at the Red Fort and Humayun's Tomb in Delhi, and the Amber Palace in Jaipur. I imagine other places have them too. I thought that was pretty cool and wish more countries would adopt this.

India can be rather intense, extremely loud and dirty, but I have to say I actually didn't find it too bad in terms of scams or tourist vs. local prices compared to most poorer countries I've been to. And regardless, if you're from a richer country India is extremely cheap no matter how much you pay. For example, if you don't want to take the train from Agra to Delhi you can just hire an outstation cab from Uber or other apps/websites to drive you for 4 hours and 200km for 2000-3000 rupees (€20-30).",comment_1,r/solotravel,Travel,,https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1ktdqgc/trip_report_india/

this is just normal, and it's not just at the Taj Mahal. they have foreigner price and local price. it's because foreigners can easily afford to pay more but they don't want to price out locals. this is all official, there are signs everywhere, there's separate queues. 

frankly this is a ridiculous thing to complain about",comment_2,r/solotravel,Travel,,https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1ktdqgc/trip_report_india/

"So good to hear from someone else that visited gwalior. I was with a friend on a train that ended up finishing at gwalior instead of where we intended. We were so annoyed and unsure because we had an itinerary planned. Anyway this guy kept looking at us in a friendly manor, eventually he came over. Turned out to be a doctor, took us off the train, straight to the box office booked us on another train ( in two days time) which was the earliest with availability, paid for it without us seeing and then wouldn’t accept any money. He then rang his friend who brought a car round, picked us up took us to a nice hotel, we paid for the hotel. And then for two days he met us everyday on bikes and showed us around gwalior, we met all their families, local spots, went out, the works. Amazing hospitality. We made sure to pay for as much as possible but it was honestly difficult with the traveller/god religious beliefs. We chatted still for years but he hasn’t responded for a while.

"Gap month and a half Hi! I recently decided to take a gap month 1/2 after I resign from my job and before moving and settling in. It would be once in a lifetime, as I will most likely not have this opportunity of free time again. Looking for some advice on which to choose from and have a few questions below. 

  
Background: Female solo traveler in early 30's, don't drink but am not opposed to going out, single. Would be my first solo trip out of the country (little nervous) but willing to take the risks. 

1) I am seeing if it might be too much with my travel plans. I plan on going from east coast-> lisbon-> greece (naxos)->chiang mai-> thai island (ko hood)-> tokyo back home. Obviously this is alot I'm aware but I'm seeing if anyone has done multiple countries like this in one sweep? Any tips?

2) If I need to remove one out of my itinerary. It would be between Greece or Lisbon. To be completely honest, I don't know much about Portugal. I have just heard on here that it is very safe for females and have heard good things when it comes to the city. I would probably venture out of the city also for a day or two. Not sure which one I should choose from. 

3) What are some important things I should do in each country ? Some thing I cannot miss for when I go.

4) What are some good hotels and airbnbs that you guys recommend for any you've been to. Are there any hostels that you know of that are appropriate for people in their early 30s? 

5) How many days for each country is appropriate?",post,r/solotravel,Travel,2.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1ku2j5c/gap_month_and_a_half/
"6 places in 6 weeks is doable, but SO expensive and you’d be knackered the whole time! You have to factor in time difference and jet lag, airport transfers and hotel check ins taking up a higher % of your trip. You’d also only scratch the surface of each place. Show up, get to hotel, see main site, do one day trip, back to airport for the next stop. 

It probably feels like this is your ‘once in a lifetime’ chance to see lots of places, but if you could afford this itinerary and constant flights and transfers. you could also afford to take more trips in your life, even if they’re shorter. 

I’d view it as a ‘once in a lifetime’ opportunity to spend 6 weeks getting to know a region in more depth. If you choose Asia or Europe you’ll still be able to experience many diverse cultures/landscapes/cuisines, and tick off quite a few countries. You can travel around by bus, train (which usually means travel to/from city centres and minimising time wasted on transfers), with some short flights for when you want to cover more ground quickly.",comment_1,r/solotravel,Travel,,https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1ku2j5c/gap_month_and_a_half/
What country is 'home'?,comment_2,r/solotravel,Travel,,https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1ku2j5c/gap_month_and_a_half/
"Honestly this is very similar to what I’ve done twice now. Six week chunks of time, many many countries each time and loved every second of it. First trip was SE Asia for month then skiing in Europe for two weeks. Second trip has been largely Asia (China, India, Indonesia, etc.) I covered the bulk of flights and hotels with credit card points but still paid out of pocket occasionally (shorter cheap flights between destinations, smaller villages with no major hotel chains, etc). It’s absolutely doable but echoing what others have said; what kind of traveler are you? Do you want to spend time unwinding in each destination (beaches in Greece are perfect for this) or are you okay with only spending a few days in each? Personally I find traveling solo I need less time than blogs and guidebooks suggest in each place since it’s so much faster seeing things solo. Dinner for example doesn’t need to take more than 45m. Seeing a major tourist destination can be done in ~2 hours, etc. I prefer to see more places vs stay put but it’s a delicate balance on not burning out (logistics and flights can be draining) but still seeing things. Also echoing what others have said; reframe it away from “once in a lifetime” as I used to think this way then realized how doable it is. Especially for six weeks, it’s very doable.

"Hey, saw your post; wanted to share my itinerary as a potentially helpful guide since I’m currently doing a similar trip for part of it through Sarajevo / Belgrade. We are leaving for Sofia so we’ll plug a flight in somewhere to get us from Serbia or Bosnia back over to there. 

We’re in Ksamil now, heading north to Sofia by June 13 for a June 16 departure (finishing a 4 month adventure starting in n Africa). I tried renting a car in Gjirokastër but couldn’t find one-way or cross-border options, so we’re sticking to buses and one flight. I think the other poster is correct and not only would the fees be high (500+€) I think you have to specifically email customer support from one of the majors (Sixt, Hertz Enterprise) for pre approval with custom pricing as you cannot simply book online cross border rentals. Our plan’s fluid—we’ll likely drop a few legs if we like a spot and 2 days per leg is rushed so here’s our route; so far in Albania the busses have been relatively easy after Greece because you can book online and Greek names make bus booking super fun. Not.

	•  Bus (~1h 50m-2h, Gjirafa)
	•  Rozafa Castle (€3-4), Lake Shkodër, Theth NP day trip (€15-25) or likely chop out another stop and hike in theth a few days.

	•  Bus (~2-2.5h, Arda Tur)
	•  Nevsky Cathedral (free), Vitosha Mtn (€6-12), Boyana Church (€5).
•  June 16: Depart Sofia


Gpt says: 

•  Book Plitvice tickets (Plitvice NP), Tesla Museum (Tesla Museum), and Dubrovnik Walls (City Walls) early.
•  Buses are reliable but check schedules (GetByBus, Omio). Borders can add time.

Good luck with your rental plan! If you can’t swing the Ohrid drop-off, buses worked for us so far. Let me know if you want more details on any stop that I’ve done. Have fun.

I am doing a solo trip to Miami starting today. About to reach in 2 hours. I live in Chicago and wanted to just have a getaway for the long weekend. 

Travel dates: 05/23 to 05/26
Staying at a  freehand miami hostel in Miami Beach
This is my first solo trip. I have a budget of $1000 apart from stay and flight ticket. I like making friends and I am pretty laid back. Like nature and good food. 

I am planning to

Day 1(05/24): drive to key west. Leave from miami beach at 8am and back by 8pm. On the way stop at wild bird sanctuary

Day 2(05/25): Drive to little Havana at 8am, then walk around the coconut groove neighborhood, bike from surfside to miami south beach

Day 3(05/26): Art deco, and leave Miami by 12pm


I have few questions:

1. Is the itinerary good ? Should I stay overnight at Key west ? Have heard that going and coming back same day is little of a stretch.  
2. Any good events that are good for solo travelers for Day 0(05/23) today. I will reach south beach at 9pm !!
2. Any good places around miami (within 30-60 min drive) you’d recommend me ?
3. How expensive is parking ? Any cheap parking around freehand miami ?

"For just the north and center of Thailand, this is fine. It's a shame you're missing out on the south though.

4000 islands is not worth it if you're not doing anything else in Laos, but I assume your planning on taking a nigh bus and stopping on the way to Cambodia. That's fine but its probably easier to just fly.

I don't really think the Indonesia part is enough time. I'd probably drop the Gili's if I were you.

Can't speak on Borneo, I haven't been.

Singapore is worth more than 2 days.

Two weeks is good for Peninsular Malaysia, but I feel like you'd be better off shortening that time a bit and adding the extra days elsewhere.

IMO it's too much in too little time overall, but if you're comfortable with seeing a half or a third of what each country has to offer and missing out on a good portion of the sights it's okay.",comment_1,r/solotravel,Travel,,https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1ktevzu/10_week_southeast_asia_itinerary_thoughts/
"Personally I'd skip Cambodia and spend that time doing the Thakhek Loop in Laos. I wouldn't spend much time in Bangkok personally, and fyi Ayutthaya can be done in a day trip. I agree that the south of Thailand is mostly skippable (though I am not a beach person), though Khao Sok National Park was quite beautiful.

I spent like two days in Kuala Lumpur and that was enough for me. I didn't find it very different than Singapore, though maybe slightly cheaper.

No Vietnam? That was probably my favorite country in SEA. Liked it way better than Thailand and even a bit better than Laos. Depends what you like though of course; I much prefer mountains to beaches or islands.",comment_2,r/solotravel,Travel,,https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1ktevzu/10_week_southeast_asia_itinerary_thoughts/

"Never been to Indonesia (except for Bintan Island near Singapore) and Borneo (except for Kota Kinabalu) so can't comment. 

I say 2 days in Siem Reap is enough.  Everything in Angkor Wat area starts to look the same after about 3 hours or so.  1 full day in Phnom Penh will be adequate IF you really really really want to go.  There's really not much to see in PP except for the Killing Field and the S21 Prison.  The bus ride takes 6 hours from SR to PP.  You can hop on a bus from PP to HCM City and the bus drops you off in the backpacker district.  Not recommended to take the cheapest bus you can find.  I paid xtra last time ($15USD vs. $9USD) and going through immigrations required NO waiting.  

Only been to Luang Prabang in Laos and have no idea about other cities.  But 8 days seem a bit too long.  Try Vietnam instead.  

Don't know how many days you plan to stay in KL.  Honestly, not much to see in KL except for the Batu Cave.    I would spend a week in Malaysia and allocate the remaining days to Vietnam instead. 

Skip Singapore if you don't have any specific places you want to see.  Or you can make Singapore a day trip from Johor Bahru (just across the causeway).  Singapore is expensive when compare to other cities you plan to visit.",comment_4,r/solotravel,Travel,,https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1ktevzu/10_week_southeast_asia_itinerary_thoughts/

I'm a trans guy and i take testosterone injections every 4 weeks, and im always debating dropping everything and traveling full time but idk how i would be able to stay on hormones. I get them free from my country, i pick them up every two months and do the injections at the clinic for free.

"Malaysia/ Phuket itinerary advice Hi, looking for some critique of my 30 day trip from mid June to mid July. I’m mid-20s female and going solo from the UK. I enjoy trying foods, sightseeing (in cities more so than nature since I’m alone) and scuba diving (I have an open water PADI). 

My main doubt about this itinerary is the number of flights I’m taking because they can be quite tiring including all the security hassle. Albeit they are all quite short flights. They seem necessary between Penang > Langkawi > Phuket > Perhentian (via KL so two flights) > KK (via KL) > KL to fly home. Priority would be to keep a good diving spot and place to see some wildlife. Also feel like Penang is a must because I love Malaysian food! Phuket is included because I’ve never been to Thailand and thought it’s a good opportunity to get a glimpse whilst I’m nearby. 

Is there somewhere I should skip or spend less /more time in. I’m intentionally avoiding the east cost of Sabah as unfortunately it is still against my government’s advice to travel there. I’ve only just booked the flights so not entirely sure what I’ll be doing in each place so any activity suggestions would be great please. This is what I’m come up with based on previous Reddit posts/blogs:

KL 4 nights
Malacca 2 nights
Ipoh 2 nights
Cameron highlands 2 nights
Penang 4 nights 
Langkawi 3 nights 
Phuket 5 nights
Perhentian islands 4 nights
Kota Kinabalu 4 nights

Thanks!",post,r/solotravel,Travel,7.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1kt69d8/malaysia_phuket_itinerary_advice/
"Unless you're planning on doing something specific in Langkawi, I'd personally just skip it.

Looks like you're already considering Ipoh, maybe add Cameron highlands or Malacca

"Finally Taking a 2.5-Month Sabbatical in Asia – Looking for Deeper, Local Travel Ideas (Not the Usual Tourist Stops) Hey everyone! I’m an American passport holder in my early 30s, and after years of thinking about it, I finally pulled the trigger—quit my job and booked a 2.5-month sabbatical to travel through Asia. It’s been a dream of mine since I was a kid, and I’m finally in a position (time-wise and financially) to make it happen.

This will actually be my fifth time in Asia, but it’s the first time I’ll be doing an extended trip there. Most of my past visits were shorter (1–2 weeks max), and I stuck to the usual highlights—Tokyo, Seoul, Bangkok, Hanoi, etc. This time I want something different. I’m less interested in checking boxes and more into immersing myself—slow travel, local experiences, and places that don’t show up in every top 10 list.

I have a budget of around $15k–$20k USD, not including flights to and from Asia. I’m mostly traveling solo and love walking cities, trying street food, talking to locals, and getting a little lost. Big fan of local markets, neighborhood cafes, community events, and just observing daily life. I’m open to all kinds of experiences, from coastal towns and smaller cities to regional festivals and more niche cultural scenes.

Tentative route (not fully locked in but likely):
	•	South Korea (probably Seoul + somewhere smaller like Jeonju or Gyeongju)
	•	China (curious about Yunnan province or some second/third-tier cities, open to ideas)
	•	Japan (already done Tokyo/Kyoto/Osaka — maybe looking into Kyushu or Tohoku region?)
	•	Thailand (thinking Chiang Mai, but wondering if there are even quieter alternatives)
	•	Vietnam (loved Hanoi last time — maybe Da Lat or Ha Giang?)
	•	Brunei (no clue what to expect here, just curious)
	•	Indonesia (open to lesser-known islands beyond Bali and Java)
	•	Cambodia (did Siem Reap last time, wondering about Kampot or Battambang)

My questions for the group:
	1.	What lesser-known cities, towns, or regions really surprised you in any of these countries?
	2.	Are there any local events, seasonal festivals, or experiences worth planning around?
	3.	If you’ve done something similar, how did you balance spontaneity vs. pre-booking?
	4.	Any advice on connecting with locals in a way that goes beyond the surface-level?

Thanks in advance to anyone who takes the time to reply. I’ve done quite a bit of research already, but I know the best tips usually come from fellow travelers who’ve been there and done it. Appreciate all the insight!",post,r/solotravel,Travel,18.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1ksrvit/finally_taking_a_25month_sabbatical_in_asia/
I think u should spend more time in each country - going in and out of each country will exhaust u esp if u have only 2.5 months and a plan to hit that many cities. If it was me I'd only pick max 3 to 4 countries and explore more cities in each place. I mean even 2.5 month in China or Japan only would give u ample time to really explore the country and know the locals,comment_1,r/solotravel,Travel,,https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1ksrvit/finally_taking_a_25month_sabbatical_in_asia/
8 countries in 2 months is the opposite of slow and immersive travel. You can’t connect with locals if you’re moving to a new destination every 2-3 days,comment_2,r/solotravel,Travel,,https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1ksrvit/finally_taking_a_25month_sabbatical_in_asia/
"I’m taking a sabbatical in Asia right now and the commenter above is simply correct, 8 countries in Asia in two months is going to be a rushed trip for what you are looking for. With this number of places, you’re just doing a regular tourist trip but for longer.

The advice on connecting is to not have everything planned out so, for example, you can spend a whole evening chatting with a local bartender on a slow night. Local people are just people working their jobs. It cuts against wanting to see a new country every week.",comment_3,r/solotravel,Travel,,https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1ksrvit/finally_taking_a_25month_sabbatical_in_asia/
"You're likely not going to get deep experiences with such a packed itinerary, sorry. 8 countries in 2.5 months is not ""slow travel"". I just spent 5 months in Asia and barely scratched the surface.

The deepest experiences will take time and you won't have that at that pace. $15-20k is a huge excess and with that approach you'll probably only ever be around locals who want your money. You can surely pay someone enough money for a ""local experience"" where you live with them, cook with them, etc. Check TripAdvisor or Get Your Guide. But you're still on rails, you're still getting the experience they know tourists like you are looking for.

Then again, that's probably a good thing. If you venture too far away from the tourist track, you'll find yourself shitting in a hole in the ground and having cockroaches crawl over you in your sleep. I wouldn't try too hard to find something super ""authentic"".

Some recommendations for \*less\* popular places:

Japan:

Onomichi - a small coastal town near Hiroshima. Lots of good food and small hole-in-the-wall spots, a path through the town that takes you through a ton of different temples. It's still a fairly popular town for tourists since it's the start of the Shimanami Kaido, a bike path that leads through the islands off the coast there, but that's a good thing unless you happen to know Japanese.

Thailand:

Chiang Mai is congested with tourists and so is Pai, located close by. If you want cheap street food and massages, and cheap beer with tons of bars and girls vying for your attention, go there. Tourists go there for debauchery, not what I'd call a ""deep"" travel experience. Pai is even worse, being pretty much entirely overrun by Western tourists.

However, it is also the start of the Mae Hong Son Loop, a motorbike loop (personally I rented a car) winding through the nearby mountains and taking you through very beautiful villages and temples. Mae Hong Son itself is pretty and quiet; I think I saw maybe two other Western tourists while I was there. Just make sure you have your IDP if you decide to drive in the area because the police are constantly on the lookout for foreigners to fine (particularly around Chiang Mai and Pai).",comment_4,r/solotravel,Travel,,https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1ksrvit/finally_taking_a_25month_sabbatical_in_asia/
"Brunei was horrible for me, I went with ideas like yours and to see natural wildlife but all I found was palm plantations (literally 99.9% of the country) destroying all their habitats and setting up and profiteering off small sanctuaries, it was a very depressing trip.

Also consider Taiwan, it hits all your requirements.",comment_5,r/solotravel,Travel,,https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1ksrvit/finally_taking_a_25month_sabbatical_in_asia/

|**Mar 2026**|Northern Vietnam / Malaysia (Kuala Lempur, Penang, Langkawi)|
|**Apr 2026**|Indonesia (Bali, Gili) or India?|

For April, I want to fly back to Bangkok and then into Dehli and catch a train to Agra see the Taj Mahal and then back to Bangkok for the rest of the month. Does that sound like reasonable or do you guys think I am better off going to Indoensia instead. Has anyone ever done this before, how was your experience? Do you think Im cutting myself too short, and it'll end up costing more than for what its worth? My biggest fear is going to India alone and just regretting it.

if you're dead set on seeing the Taj Mahal, sure why not. Would I do it? probably not.

Other than that I think your plan looks mostly good. 

I don't think you'll spend a month in Laos or Cambodia unless you find more places you find interesting. Which obviously could happen if someone tells you about some cool place they went to and you wanna go (e.g. Don Det). good to have a buffer

"Help! Please check my 44-day Peru & Bolivia itinerary starting next week – and answer a few key questions! I’m flying to Peru this Sunday (May 25) and planning to travel for about six weeks through both Peru and Bolivia. I haven’t booked most things yet because I wasn’t sure how I’d react to the altitude and jet lag, so I thought I’d just figure it out along the way, like I did last year in Mexico.

But now I’m realising this is peak season, and I keep hearing that everything needs to be booked early – so I’m getting nervous.

Of course I want to see Machu Picchu, but I didn’t buy a ticket in advance. I’m hoping to join a last-minute Salkantay Trek, and from what I read, it might still be possible to queue up for a Machu Picchu ticket at Aguas Calientes if I’m lucky. Has anyone done that recently? Is it still possible in 2025, or have the rules changed?

Also – I’m not a super experienced hiker, but I keep hearing that Salkantay is the must-do trek. Most tours I’ve seen are 5 days. Are there shorter or easier options (e.g. 4 days or even 2-3 days)? How much do those cost usually? And if I join last minute, do they help organise the Machu Picchu ticket and the trip to Aguas Calientes for me?

Some people also told me to just skip the trek and take the train to Machu Picchu as a one-day visit. I’m torn – what do you think is the best experience overall, especially if I’m not a hardcore hiker but still want something meaningful?

⸻

Here are a few other questions I’d love your input on:
	
•	Huaraz or not? Some people suggest going from Lima directly to Huaraz for high-altitude treks like Laguna 69, but I haven’t included it in my itinerary. Is it worth the detour and effort (right at the beginning of the trip)? Or is it too intense to do right after landing, especially during winter?

•	Bus vs flights: I planned to travel mostly by bus – is that okay? Or would you recommend taking more domestic flights instead?

•	Bolivia timing: I’ve only left 8 days for Bolivia. Is that enough, or should I rearrange and go to Bolivia earlier in the trip?

•	Return from Bolivia: Should I end the trip in Bolivia and fly back to Lima from La Paz, instead of circling back to Peru again?
	
•	Vaccines: I haven’t had the yellow fever shot. Is it okay with my current itinerary?
	

•	Season & weather: Are there any places I should skip or swap, given it’s winter? Any legs of the trip that feel too rushed or too slow?

⸻

I’d be super grateful for any advice, suggestions, or thoughts – especially from those who’ve done parts of this route!

"> • Bolivia timing: I’ve only left 8 days for Bolivia. Is that enough, or should I rearrange and go to Bolivia earlier in the trip?

Depends on what you want to do. It is nowhere near enough to see even a fraction of the country. You could spend your entire 44 day trip in Bolivia and still have things left to do. But if all you want to do is the 3 day salt flats tour, a couple of days in la paz and a day in Copacabana then sure. IMO 8 days is not much time, I'd say 2 weeks is a better number, but I'm a bit biased.

Bear in mind that it pays to be flexible in Bolivia, it's not uncommon for road blocks to spring up over night and when that happens it can often mean the entire country grinds to a halt. Given the economic situation and the upcoming elections it is not implausible that you'll end up stuck somewhere for a day or longer.

> • Bus vs flights: I planned to travel mostly by bus – is that okay? Or would you recommend taking more domestic flights instead?

Travelling by bus is fine, it might help if you spoke some Spanish, but you can get by without it. But bear in mind many journeys are going to be overnight and you may not sleep that well. Buses can get pretty cold at night so you might want to pick up a blanket or two to travel with once you arrive.

> • Season & weather: Are there any places I should skip or swap, given it’s winter? Any legs of the trip that feel too rushed or too slow?

The salt flats can get down to about -15C at night during the winter, it'll be warm in the day though, but pack for cold weather at night. Other places, especially those at altitude will also got pretty cold at night.

> • Vaccines: I haven’t had the yellow fever shot. Is it okay with my current itinerary?

I think so. There are countries that require it as an entry requirement but neither Peru nor Bolivia did (last I checked), and while Bolivia and maybe peru have some areas with a risk of yellow fever, they are not likely to be places you are going. But all this info (border requirements and risk zones) are available online so do some research to be safe.",comment_2,r/solotravel,Travel,,https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1kt0xwk/help_please_check_my_44day_peru_bolivia_itinerary/
"It seems like you have lots of time in Cusco. You can probably find stuff to do, but you may want to switch a Cusco day for Lima at the end. Cruz del Sur is a really comfortable and safe bus company in Peru, but they don't go from Puno to La Paz. For that part, I recommend Boliviahop. Traveling within Peru, though, Cruz del Sur is much more affordable. If you're not a big hiker, I wouldn't make your first stop Huaraz. Adjust to the altitude at least three days first. You adjust your itinerary for Arequipa if you need to do the Salkantay trek at a different time. You can do the Arequipa part on the way to Cusco or on the way to Puno/Lake Titicaca. You probably won't need a yf shot for that part of Bolivia but there are also places in Lima where you can get the shot for 50-60 dollars.

"If it helps - we lined for Machu Picchu tickets at Aguas Calientes last year. Basically we got there early morning, lined up and got tickets for the next day, hung out around the town (not a bad place, very touristy vibes but it was chill), went up to MP the next morning and got back to Cuzco by night. 

The ticketing had some complications - IIRC we had to line up early to get a time slot, *then* came back later to actually get the tickets and pay. We did have a local tour guide helping us (as he was going to be our tour guide for MP the next day anyways), but I think it was very doable solo.",comment_5,r/solotravel,Travel,,https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1kt0xwk/help_please_check_my_44day_peru_bolivia_itinerary/

"Don’t let the haters deter you. I spent 10 days driving all over Iceland including the Westfjords and it was magic!!!!! If you don’t mind driving - if you are ok with some hella scary roads off the ring road (fog, sheep, no guardrails, deep drops, reall only room for 1 lane, etc) and they are doable and fun though - as long as you know what you are signing up for - it’s great having that freedom. 

I went end of June so had the midnight sun as well and being at a waterfall, alone, at 2am with the sun out was incredible. Whale watching at midnight.

"You might find this to be overly ambitious. I'd prioritize the top one or two things you want to see each day and be willing to drop others if you find yourself feeling fatigued.  You also want to make sure that you give yourself enough time to appreciate the stops.  Make sure you get to walk around a bit, enjoy the sights and the sounds.  You don't want to have just enough time to ""check the box ""

"How long to wait after report of bedbug in hostel? Hello everyone! I hope you can help me out. I’m going to Paris in 4 months and I’m now booking my accommodations. I’ve narrowed it down to two options. 

1. Dormitory bed in hostel. The last time they had bed bugs was in November 2024. I checked 3 sites (including Google reviews) and they’ve only had another report in back in April 2023. At least in the complaint, they respond with that they’ve called the exterminators. Most of the other reviews mention how clean the place is. 
2. Single room in hostel. Much more expensive (almost double the cost of the dormitory bed). I’ve checked 3 sites and besides complaints about general dirt and no AC, I can’t find any reports about bed bugs.

"Wish I'd Discovered Hostels Sooner – A Little Reflection from a 30-something. 
I'm currently preparing for my third hostel trip, and I can't help but reflect on how much I wish I'd discovered this style of travel in my 20s.

Backstory: I spent my teens and early 20s in the army, living a very structured life and always around people (barracks, deployments, etc). So when I left, holidays meant one thing—space.

 I'd book hotels, keep to myself, and just decompress. Nothing wrong with that... but I now realise how much I missed out on by not embracing hostels earlier.

On a whim a while back, I decided to try a hostel while travelling solo. Thought, “I've done the shared living thing before, how bad can it be?” Turned out—it wasn't bad. It was brilliant. 

The connections, random conversations, shared meals, last-minute plans with strangers who become mates... it’s honestly been a game-changer. And it's a fraction of the cost too.

If anyone's hesitant or thinks hostels are just for gap year students and 20-year-old backpackers—don’t rule it out. I’ve met all ages, backgrounds, and stories in these places. Whether you're looking to socialise or just save money while having a base, it’s totally worth a shot.

Just wanted to share for anyone on the fence or feeling ""too old"" to try something new.

Would love to hear if anyone else had a late-in-life hostel epiphany?",post,r/solotravel,Travel,269.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1ks8xk6/wish_id_discovered_hostels_sooner_a_little/

"3 weeks in Ecuador or Colombia for hiking/photography? (1st time backpacking in South America) Hey everyone! As you can tell from the title I am planning my first trip (solo dolo) to South America for July of this year and would like some perspective from people who have been to either Colombia and/or Ecuador.

Some background about me - I'm 24M and am conversational in Spanish (B2ish) and really enjoy hiking, city/nature photography and experiencing the local culture when I travel. I also enjoy talking with locals and exploring small towns (maybe this isn't as feasible for this trip though). I have done some backpacking throughout Western/Eastern Europe and Japan/Korea so I'm not completely new to backpacking, I'm just new to South America. I wouldn't say no to going out and partying but I'm not necessarily seeking that out or making it a priority.

Budget - trying to keep moderately low and mainly sticking to hostels but I'm willing to pay for experiences here and there. 

Which place in your opinion would be the best option for me and my interests? Also any thoughts on the saftey situation in both places? Also is 3 weeks too much for Ecuador/Colombia? I was considering 2 weeks there and 1 week in Mexico City but I live in Texas so Mexico City isn't that hard to get to.

"Basically, you can easily do what you want to do in either country.

Three weeks certainly isn't 'too much' time.

Which should you choose? I personally favour Colombia, not only based on your list of likes but generally,I find it more interesting, more diverse,I like the cities more than in Ecuador and I find people friendlier too.

But Ecuador is definitely worth visiting too.It has some things that Colombia doesn't, like the Galapagos, though they are not low budget.

Neither country is particularly 'unsafe'.Certainly not in the places that tourists visit.You need to take basic safety precautions, that's all.",comment_1,r/solotravel,Travel,,https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1kt9cq2/3_weeks_in_ecuador_or_colombia_for/
"Purely for hiking it might be Ecuador. You can get up to 5000 or 6000m peaks which are all generally clustered around one area. There's a lot of outdoor stuff and other backpackers in Baños, and from there you can travel down to lower elevation where things start to turn jungley as the Andes turn into the rainforest.

For non hiking aspects Colombia is more interesting for travelling in terms of culture and variability (i.e. Santa Marta is a very different place to Medellin).",comment_2,r/solotravel,Travel,,https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1kt9cq2/3_weeks_in_ecuador_or_colombia_for/

I just finished backpacking South America and I spent 6 weeks in Colombia and 5 weeks in Ecuador. I think Ecuador has crazier hiking and stuff but for first time in South America I think Colombia is better.

"Is this feasible? I’ll be in Ibiza June 27 and 28 so will be scoping it out for myself but wanted to run this past people who have been before ahead of time to ensure what I’m planning makes sense. 

**June 29**

- arrive to Barcelona via cruise ship at noon, drop off carry on luggage somewhere in the city center

- bum around the city, chill/sleep at a day use hotel

- Arrive at airport at 21:00, drop off back pack and carry on at EXCESS BAGGAGE facility

- fly to Ibiza at 23:20. 

**June 30**

- arrive to Ibiza 00:25, dance the night away at Pacha to SOLOMUN!!!!! 

- Leave Pacha @ 05:00, fly back to Barcelona @ 07:00

- Grab luggage, fly to Madrid

**QUESTIONS**

- I’ll be ubering around Barcelona and Ibiza; is 2 hours enough time to go through security and passport control for each flight or can I show up with an hour to spare? 

- Does the Ibiza airport offer valuables storage? Don’t really wanna take my passport to the clurb.

**OF NOTE**

- I am a night owl who goes to sleep at 4am every single night - staying up all night is not an issue. 

- why not disembark the cruise ship early? No desire to pay $300 for accommodation when I’ll have a perfectly great cabin already. Plus, wanna get more in time in BCN

"Oaxaca for Dia De Los Muertos this year Hi all! I am a solo traveler (F30s) planning to travel to Mexico for a little over a month this October-November, and while I have several stops planned for various reasons, the one place and occasion I'd love to have more input and conversation with my fellow solo travelers about is Oaxaca for Dia de los muertos! I know this a popular occasion that I've seen so many travelers talking about their plans for and sharing trip reports for in just about every travel community I belong to over the years...so I figured I'd open up the conversation here to hopefully become the main sharing hub for any solo travelers like myself that are planning to do Dia de los muertos in Oaxaca (or Mexico, in general!) this year to share and converse and plan their journeys for 2025! ✨️🫶

I was debating between Mexico City and Oaxaca- and I even considered Merida, as I'll be heading there right after Oaxaca, but ultimately it didn't seem like there's much of a large scale celebration in Merida, specifically, based on my research thus far- but it seems like Oaxaca is more aligned with my vibe for this celebration, specifically. I'm thinking of staying in Oaxaca for about a week total, from October 30/31 through November 5th or 6th. 

The biggest piece of planning I'm struggling with is WHERE exactly to stay in Oaxaca that will be within 15-20 minute walking/or short (5-10 minute) cab rides away from the heary of all the main celebrations, as I won't have a car (and being from New York City, I'm very comfortable and used to walking several miles in a day, no problem at all). 

One thing I'm really looking forward to doing is joining a local workshop or otherwise learning how to make an ofrenda, as I'll be honoring/celebrating my parents who both passed away this past year- so I'd love to stay somewhere that's in the cultural heart of it all, where I can fully immerse myself in the experience of honoring deceased loved ones and make meaningful connections with other people doing the same. On a lighter note, I'm also very into the idea of donning a butterfly costume for some sort of party or parade, as I've always loved the symbolism of butterflies as they pertain to personal growth and transformation, and I know they're a popular symbol during Dia de los muertos as well, which I'm very excited about! 🦋 


I look forward to any and all replies, trip reports, tips/tricks, and input to the conversation! I can't wait to hear about what everyone else is planning as well, and hope this thread will help others in the planning stages for this fall! ✨️ 💛",post,r/solotravel,Travel,3.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1ksy4p9/oaxaca_for_dia_de_los_muertos_this_year/

I strongly suggest staying somewhere walkable over Uber-able. Trying to get anywhere by car when festivities kick off can be miserable. Go to Google Maps and find Zocalo in Oaxaca (the main square); imagine this as the bottom left of a rectangle. Now find the ADO bus station; that's your top right. Now take that rectangle and expand it in all directions by about about 3-5 blocks. Aim to stay somewhere inside of that rectangle. 

>I'm thinking of staying in Oaxaca for about a week total, from October 30/31 through November 5th or 6th.

One of the biggest performance parades is the evening of the 30th, so I would definitely aim to be there for that. If I were to go again, I'd probably aim to arrive on the evening of the 29th, but the 30th is fine too.

Also, if you arrive on the 29th and wander around at all, people will tell you where to go on the 30th. But, it literally takes over the Zocalo to Santo Domingo Church area. If you're going solo and won't be in a hostel, check our Airbnb events. There's usually local people who plan events for travelers every night from the 29th onwards.",comment_2,r/solotravel,Travel,,https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1ksy4p9/oaxaca_for_dia_de_los_muertos_this_year/
"This is such amazing- and beautifully specific!- advice re: where EXACTLY to stay- as a visual learner, I cannot thank you enough for the literal diagram! 😂🔥🙌🙏 I also wholeheartedly agree- and as a New Yorker having had to deal with throngs of tourists and insane gridlock on any major holiday/occasion where it's an absolute impossibility to get just about anywhere by car, that's one of the main reasons I want to make sure I'm staying smack dab in the walkable center of it all for the festivities in Oaxaca. The only reason I even included the ""5-10 minute car ride"" distance caveat is in case there's one or 2 specific, absolute can't miss events that happen to lie outside of the main hub where everything else takes place. 

Also very much appreciate your input about my butterfly costume idea- I'm glad to hear a confirmation that it's a great idea, from someone who's been there! And thank you for letting me know about the parade taking place on the 30th, too! I can definitely arrive on the 29th, in that case, so I appreciate the heads up. Can you by any chance point me in the direction of a link to the event page of said parade from last year? Or let me know what it was called? Or is it basically a can't miss situation, like it's *THE* parade going on on the 30th?

"Some Travel/Life Advice Needed :) Hey everyone. I (23M) just graduated undergraduate university last week, packed everything I own into a storage unit, and am currently on my way to Vietnam with a one-way ticket to meet some friends and ride the HCMC to Nah Trang loop over 2 weeks.

This is quite the transitional time in my life, and when I return to NYC at the start of September, it’s going to be full steam ahead with work, internships and growing my business. I’m incredibly excited for that chapter to start, but with it comes responsibility, and I know that it’s unlikely I’ll have time this free of anything in my life again. 

I’ve done my best to setup this time with nearly zero obligations, and set out to experience a side of the world and humanity that I’ve never seen.

So, that all being said, what would you do? What do you wish you would have done? I’m open to any and all suggestions, down for whatever. Not the biggest sight-seeer, more out here for the experience. I love driving, never been camping but completely would, etc.

Last year I traveled in Europe, spend a semester in Stockholm, then traveled mostly solo to Barcelona, Amsterdam, Budapest, drove across Ibiza, drove Roma to Milan and spent a little time in Berlin. I love meeting people at hostels, airports or randomly, love driving or traveling by bike/whatever weird way. 

This trip I hope to do more detached from modern society. I was thinking of not bringing/using a smartphone, but ultimately brought one and a cheap laptop to book transport with.

So essay over, here’s my current idea, traveling from now until early August. Budget $3000/mo (less ideally)

May 27-June 11

Hochimin city to Nah Trang loop (with 3 friends, rest solo)

June 11-18

Try and make it HCMC to Cambodia to bangkok hitchhiking/trains/scooter

June 18-July 10

A lot of time in India solo, no fixed places yet

Goa

New Delhi

Hrishikesh

Madurai

Srinagar

July 10-14

Maybe Poland to see a friend

July 15-28

Berlin for festival

July 28-Aug 4

Marseille

Cherbourg, France

Aug 4-12

Sail to London from Cherbourg, then fly from London to NYC

Honestly it helps to be really confident and comfortable in your own self and being alone with yourself. I live alone with no partners and outside of work I don’t really see my friends except maybe once every 2 months. When I’m in another country all those things are still true just in another location.

Somehow I have managed to mentally dodge the visa-requiring process upon planning this whole trip. I even got the 2 boarding passes without hassle at the airport.

On the bus now on my way home. Lesson learned.",post,r/solotravel,Travel,420.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1krtq3p/tifu_by_not_having_a_visa_to_azerbaijan/
"Whoops. You put the ""bye Jan"" in Azerbaijan.

They do have an urgent e-visa, you couldn't reschedule the flight from Istanbul?",comment_1,r/solotravel,Travel,,https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1krtq3p/tifu_by_not_having_a_visa_to_azerbaijan/
"Haha.

I actually did that in panick at the gate. Was like a proper action movie moment, shaking hands and plane about to lift-off in like 30 minutes, waiting for me. So I got the visa processing number and all, but they still would not let me board using that reference. Bye, bye about EUR 150 :( I thought it was one of those kind of automatic digital visas which gets approved automatically, but apparantly the emergency ones still take 3-5 hours to get approved.

And yes they could reschedule my flight but that would cost me quite a lot of money + I was only going there for an extended weekend and hence the trip would be totally upside down, planning-wise.",comment_2,r/solotravel,Travel,,https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1krtq3p/tifu_by_not_having_a_visa_to_azerbaijan/

Shit happens. Live and learn. That happened to me on my second trip to Japan because I hadn't realized the visa requirements for my country changed. Was stuck in immigration for hours but luckily the people I was visiting were local and confirmed I was only there for a wedding so they issued me a 2 week landing permit,comment_4,r/solotravel,Travel,,https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1krtq3p/tifu_by_not_having_a_visa_to_azerbaijan/
"That's annoying to pay for it and still not make it. Actually impressive that you just gave up on it at that point, I find it really easy to fall for sunk cost in situations like that.

I did the same thing in Turkey, didn't realize I needed a visa, but thankfully they have visa on arrival. Could have sworn I didn't have a visa on my prior trip there.",comment_5,r/solotravel,Travel,,https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1krtq3p/tifu_by_not_having_a_visa_to_azerbaijan/
"The solo travel Latin America autumn/winter conundrum - aka ""Escaping freezing Buenos Aires"". Without spending an absolute fortune on one way flight, where can I go from BA that fills my criteria? Here's 4 I have so far that look solo travel friendly .... I've been solo in Buenos Aires for a few months now, but the weather has turned to shit - it was 9 degrees Celsius this morning!

I'm looking for somewhere that's warm (**at least 20 degrees Celsius**), sunny, and dry from late May/early June onwards in Latin America. 

Plan is to base myself in one place for about 4 weeks as I work online.

**Flight Budget:**

I'm trying not to spend more than circa $350 USD on the one-way flight from Buenos Aires.

**Must-Haves:**

It needs to be solo-travel friendly: this means generally safe, easy to navigate, and with friendly locals.

Good infrastructure is essential: I absolutely need reliable WiFi for work. Also looking for a good range of accommodation options, easy local transportation, and access to daily amenities 

For my daily budget, I'm aiming for a max of $60 USD on regular days. For accommodation, ideally around $30 USD for a private room in a guesthouse/budget Airbnb or similar.

**The Vibe & Activities I'm After:**

1 - My main way to exercise and explore is long-distance walking, so places with decent paths are a must (e.g., good city sidewalks, park loops, coastal promenades).

2 - I love checking out local markets, especially night food markets

3 - I'm interested in local culture like street art, hearing live music, or finding artisan crafts.

3 - I’d be open to casually improving my Spanish 

4 - I enjoy a vibrant atmosphere with good cafes and restaurants.

5 - Definitely NO nightlife or party scene focus – I don't drink alcohol.

6 - Also not looking for strenuous stuff like dedicated hiking trails, cycling, or water sports - it’s not my thing

**Beach Town Thoughts:**

A beach town setting would be a nice bonus and great for walks, but the other factors above are the priority

**Avoiding a destination's wet season as much as possible**

This is a pain in the ass at this time of year in many Latin America destinations - but I'm really trying to avoid places where it rains for hours every day 
 

**Places I've Considered:**

I've done some preliminary research, and places like Lima (Peru), Iquique (Chile), and Asunción (Paraguay) came up. Curaçao also looks interesting, but flights from BA seem higher.

Re: Lima though, some are saying it’s quite cold there now, in addition to the usual Lima heavy fog. Maybe it's a bad choice this time of year? 

**My Questions:**

1 - Given all these details, do any of my initially considered spots (Lima, Iquique, Asunción) sound like they could actually work for a 4-week solo stay / remote work base?

2 - Or, are there other Latin American destinations you'd strongly recommend that really nail this combination of weather, budget, infrastructure, and my specific interests?

To be honest, I’m looking for more new suggestions more than I’m looking for feedback on those 4 destinations 

None of the 4 really tick all the boxes

**Important Note:**

No Rio suggestions, please - I've already spent 3 months there and looking for somewhere new 

And re: Medellín in Colombia: I definitely want to go there this year, but not during it's current wet season 

**And a ""PS"" on the $350 flight cost:**

I'm a bit flexible on this if the destination is really worth it 

Would love your feedback and any insights",post,r/solotravel,Travel,24.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1kscvu1/the_solo_travel_latin_america_autumnwinter/

"I spent last year one and a half months in Paraguay, from July to August. The weather was nice in the beginning was raining a lot and it was windy, but from it was one week tops like that the rest it was all sun and good.

The city itself doesn't have a lot to do, but I've enjoyed staying there since I look for more chill cities. To give you an idea, it was a city with a lot of movement during the day but after 22:00 the whole city was quiet and you could hear crickets.

Buuut, if I'm honest, after two weeks I didn't find much more to do there. I went from Asuncion to Buenos Aires and it was really enjoyable but almost 24 hours in a bus.

And one huge important thing, there isn't a lot of flight leaving from Asuncion and they're expensive, so think it carefully your destination after Asuncion. Even for buses the only options to go to another country are Bolivia, Argentina and Brazil. And the bus to Bolivia take more than a whole days.",comment_4,r/solotravel,Travel,,https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1kscvu1/the_solo_travel_latin_america_autumnwinter/
"Did you consider El Salvador? San Salvador has a ton of affordable spots to stay and theyve commissioned some good art to cover up graffiti and clean up the parks. It’s super super safe and you can uber around super cheap (drivers will give you their card so you can skip the app next time). El tunco (beach) is a bit is pretty calm during weekdays (weekend evenings are a huge party scene), and only 45 min from San Salvador - with super cheap buses all day. There are a ton of other small beach towns there that are much calmer. 
It IS the rainy season but they had a bad April, and all of May has been really fine with just a bit of clouds and a sprinkle or two in the afternoon or evening. 
On another thought, everyone I talked to in El Salvador goes on vacation to Guatemala - so I’d give that a look too! 
As for flight prices, I’ve found flights there for about $280 recently.",comment_5,r/solotravel,Travel,,https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1kscvu1/the_solo_travel_latin_america_autumnwinter/

"Planning a trip to Budapest, any thoughts on my itinerary? I'm planning a solo trip to Budapest in July.

I plan to stay at a party hostel to meet other people. I'm still deciding between Onefam Budapest and Vitae Hostel. If anyone here has stayed at either hostels and could share their experience, that would be great!

This is my itinerary for Budapest as of right now:

Wednesday July 9:

* Depart from Toronto to Budapest at night

Thursday July 10:

* Arrive in Budapest in the afternoon
* Central Market Hall

Friday July 11:

* St. Stephen's Basilica

Saturday July 12:

* Heroes' Square
* Széchenyi Thermal Bath

Sunday July 13:

* Fisherman's Bastion
* Castle District

Monday July 14:

* Széchenyi Chain Bridge
* Buda Castle
* Varhegy

Tuesday July 15:

* Hungarian Parliament Building
* Shoes on the Danube Bank
* Legenda City Cruises (Budapest Danube River Sightseeing Night Cruise)

Wednesday July 16:

* Depart from Budapest back to Toronto in the afternoon

I plan to also go out every night as both hostels run daily pub crawls. I don't know if Vitae runs events during the day, but Onefam does so I'm planning to attend at least of their daytime events such as their walking tours.

Any thoughts on my itinerary? Good or bad? What would you change, replace, add, or remove from my itinerary? Which of these places should I buy tickets in advance? I remember when I went to Amsterdam last summer I had to buy my Anne Frank House ticket one month in advance. Also, what's the best metro pass to get to get around Budapest? In Lisbon, they have a Lisboa card where you can get up to three days of unlimited travel and free entry to some of the most popular museums/attractions like the Belém Tower for a really good price. I'm trying to see if there is some card or membership I should get when I arrive in Budapest.",post,r/solotravel,Travel,0.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1kss0n9/planning_a_trip_to_budapest_any_thoughts_on_my/
It's a super light itinerary. You're basically just doing one thing a day so that's as easy as it gets. Probably for the best if you'll be hungover every morning.

"Future travel hotspots? I was recently reading about the hippie trail and how major stops along that route included Afghanistan, Iran, Iraq, and Syria - essentially places that now don’t see tourism. I also was talking to my great aunt and she was telling me some of the destinations she visited back in her traveling heyday that were surprising to me as these wouldn’t be common tourist hotspots in todays day and age, but were popular back then.

It got me thinking about the reverse scenario - what destinations right now would you be fairly surprised/shocked if someone mentioned going there for tourism, but you see having potential for future tourism? I’ve seen several posts talking about underrated destinations that may garner more popularity in the future, but they’re still currently somewhat traveled to destinations. Where right now has little to no tourism (whether it be due to conflict, safety, lack of tourism infrastructure, etc) but you believe could have potential for the future? It doesn’t have to be very plausible, just somewhat possible. For example, I think 10 years ago if someone mentioned they were going to Saudi Arabia’s for tourism it would be very surprising and invoke a lot of questions (if not impossible given they didn’t really open for tourism until more recently I think) but now it’s possible to go and we are seeing people travel there (or at least I’m seeing Instagram reels of new hotels and activities there, not sure what the numbers actually look like). Just an example I’m throwing out there, but I’m curious to see what this sub thinks about other possible future destinations that today you’d be very surprised if someone mentioned going to.",post,r/solotravel,Travel,7.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1ksevkw/future_travel_hotspots/
"This question comes up quite often, and of course there are different views.

There are actually not many countries that see no tourists at all And there are a lot that see plenty!

Most of those that see very few, it's for specific reasons... nothing 
of 'mainstream  interest' to see, very difficult to get to, very small islands in the middle of nowhere, lack of infrastructure,war etc.And sometimes the political system, which can change of course.

Anyway! I'd say that it's tough to predict.Especially the political side... somewhere like Ukraine and Russia for example,who knows what the situation will be like there in ten years time? But they might once again be quite popular destinations.

Iraq and Syria might become more popular than now but I don't think they'll be mainstream tourist spots.

Another place where there could potentially be 'opening up'... Algeria.That country has a lot that could attract tourists,if the Algerian government actually wants them to come.

I'd say all of Europe is already fairly well touristed, and nearly all of Asia too.

Turkmenistan,if there is political change there?

Saudi Arabia that you mentioned is the one that is most likely to become a popular tourist destination I'd say, particularly with Muslim tourists but also Europeans to some extent...in the same way that Dubai or Abu Dhabi are now.",comment_1,r/solotravel,Travel,,https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1ksevkw/future_travel_hotspots/

"How do you organize your important travel documents? (Passports, insurance, medical info, etc.) Hey fellow travelers,

I keep running into the same headache over and over while traveling, and I’m wondering how you guys deal with it.

Things like my passport scan, travel insurance, emergency contact info, visa documents, booking confirmations, and even just notes about my allergies or blood type — they all end up in different places: emails, cloud drives, photos, paper folders, random apps...

Then, when I actually need one of them (crossing a border, checking in, filing a claim, or find myself in an emergency situation abroad), it’s always a hassle trying to find what I need.

So I’m curious:

1.	How do you keep your important travel-related documents organized and accessible?
2.	Have you ever had issues because something was missing or hard to find during a trip?
3.	Do you use any tools, apps, or methods that make this easier?

"Trip Report: Mexico City for Five Days I recently took a solo trip to Mexico City and wanted to share my activities in hope that they help others make the most of their trip there.  A few things to start off - this was my first time in Mexico, I speak little to no Spanish, I'm at 36M, and I don't really drink/party so my main goals for the trip were to explore the city, eat good food, hit coffee shops, see a few museums, and visit Teotihuacán.  Below is an outline of my trip.

Day 0:

Landed at MEX in the early afternoon.  Customs was quick, but getting out of the airport was a bit confusing.  I tried to walk to the local ""MetroBus"" train station but kept kind of going circles and ended up at the wrong train station, so I said screw it and ubered to my hostel.  I stayed at [Anys Hostal](https://www.hostelworld.com/hostels/p/42617/anys-hostal/) in the Roma Norte neighborhood and it was great for me - I paid for my own room & bathroom which I was more than I needed.  The room itself was huge and actually had three beds, not sure if I accidentally booked some family suite or what.  The place itself had very ""bed and breakfast"" vibes, there's even a little cafe on the main level.  Seemed to be family owned, everyone I interacted it with was super friendly, although only one spoke decent English.  After getting situated I hit the streets and grabbed a coffee at the nearby [Nice Day Cafe](https://www.nicedaymx.com/) \-  which was a very cool Japanese-themed spot.  I ended up going there like three times during my whole trip.  After that I mainly walked around Roma Norte.  I was blown away by just how many street food options there were, like literally every corner had at least one and they all smelled/looked good.  Ended up getting an early dinner at a Mexican restaurant called Santo Habanero, and then getting a little evening espresso at [Almanegra Cafe](https://almanegra.cafe/?srsltid=AfmBOop_tFxqa43zvOt99kgLYmkKetYarQ9OnOmAF5QkhCGKh85IMuce) (another great spot that I revisited and also bought beans from).

  
Day 1:

Main goal was the hit the National Anthropology Museum.  I'm not a breakfast person, so I took a walk to [Cardinal Cafe](https://www.instagram.com/casacardinal/?hl=en) (great local chain) for some coffee and then started walking to the area which most the museums are.  I could have used the bus, but it was a nice day and there was so much to look at so I just walked.  Ended up walking by some weed-related demonstration which interesting.  Eventually I got to the ""museum park"" area which was beautiful.  I was initially surprised at how wooded the area was, I didn't expect so much nature anywhere in CDMX.  Explored a few trails and then went to the National Anthropology Museum.  I did not buy tickets ahead of time and had no issue getting one, I got there not long after they opened though.  This museum was beyond excellent.  Probably one of the best museums I've been to ever.  I spent about four hours there, and I could've stayed longer.  There was so many things to look at, sections for different civilizations, it was honestly amazing.  Afterwards, went back to my room to shower/nap.  

That night, I said yolo and decided to go to a Lucha Libre event at the nearby arena.  Walking up to the event was a madhouse - a gazillion people/vendors wearing/selling the funny masks.  The event itself was hilarious.  The first few matchups were ehh but they got better as the event went on.  They even brought out some midgets at one point.  Afterwards went home and crashed.

  
Day 2:

Went back to Almanegra for coffee and then bused to down to the Coyoacan neighborhood.  I heard this area was very nice, if even a bit uppity.  I can now say the area was great.  It was definitely great.  There was an open square area with lots of bars and restaurants, a big food/vendor hall (tourist trap), and since I was there on a saturday there was an art event so I bought some street art.  I also noticed that there were more tourists here than in Roma Norte, purely based on how many people I walked by that spoke English.  Definitely came across more Americans, also seemed to come across more people in their 30s.  Honestly if/when I return to CDMX I might even stay in this neighborhood.  

Ending up getting a coffee at another great spot called [Avellaneda](https://www.instagram.com/avellanedakf/?hl=en), and then walked north.  I walked past the Frida Kahlo museum tried to get a ticket, but it was sold out for like the next ten days or something, so that if that's something you want to hit then definitely buy tickets ahead of time.  I did go to the Leon Trotsky museum though, which was very good especially for the price, and spent about one hour or so there before headed back.  Ended up getting some great middle eastern food near my room at a place called [Fuego](https://fuegooriental.com.mx/).

  
Day 3:

Decided to go back to the area where the museums are, but mainly just to explore park and get my nature fix.  Hit up a Japanese-themed cafe called [Cucurucho](https://cucuruchocafe.com/) on the way (also great, also bought some beans).  The park itself was so nice, many people running/bikes and even doing martial arts classes.  Afterwards I decided to go over the Historic Centro District.  Again I could've used the public transit, but I decided to walk/bike a bit since it was nice and there was so much to see.  The Centro area was wild.  First, I did not know CDMX had a Chinatown so that was interesting.  Also, it was by far the most crowded/hectic of all the places that I've been.  The area directly around the National Palace and Cathedral was filled with tents and homeless encampments.  I never felt unsafe or anything, but it was mind boggling how many tents there were.  I took some photos and then took the train back.  First time on the train and it quick and easy (crowded though).  Got off near my place, got a coffee at [Yola Cafe](https://www.instagram.com/yolacafealiado/?hl=en) (cool spot with lots of Star Wars decor).

That night, I said yolo again and decided to buy a ticket to the Club America vs. Cruz Azul footy match.  I'm a huge soccer fan, and even though I know Mexicans take footy seriously I decided to go.  Now where I went wrong was buying a cheap Cruz Azul jersey on my way to the game which was at the Club America stadium.  I collect jerseys, and I walked by a place selling some, and the Cruz Azul jersey looked sick so I bought it lol.  Luckily the stadium was nearby so I just had to bus, and upon pulling up it was pretty next level.  Thousands of fans, hundreds of police, but I never really felt unsafe.  Definitely different than all the games I've been to the states though, but honestly it was cool.  I just felt kinda silly wearing the Cruz Azul jersey.  And the stadium/game itself was awesome!  They had the smoke going beforehand, there was so much energy from the very beginning.  I was at the top and luckily sat next to some cool Club America fans who spoke decent English, and I just explained that I love football (soccer lol) and wanted to see a game, which they understood.  Ended up making small talk with them and had a great time.  Now Cruz Azul scored first but Club America came back to win, which I'm kinda glad given that my dumbass was wearing a Cruz Azul jersey.  Not to suggest that something bad might've happened, but still, didn't really wanna risk it.  Getting home from the stadium sucked though, I ran to the bus and the station was a mad house.  So much pushing and shoving.  Probably the shittiest bus ride ever.  But worth it.



Day 4:

A few days prior to this I booked a Teotihuacan Balloon Ride and Pyramid Tour on the GetYourGuide app for about $230USD, and today was the day for that.  My booking included: transportation to and from, a balloon tour, breakfast, a pyramid tour, and a tour at the Guadaloupe Basilica.  It started at 4:30AM at a monument in Roma Norte, basically met up with a group, got on a bus and rolled out.  Took about an hour to get to the balloon ride place.  The balloon ride was honestly sick, got some amazing views/pictures of the pyramids.  The balloons themselves were also fascinating to see operate.  Only negative thing worth mentioning is they are kind of crowded and you can't really move around the ""basket"" once you're up there.  After we landed we then went to some fancy restaurant with a breakfast buffet which was great.  After we ate there was also mini tequila/mezcal tasting and then we got to check out some azteca gift shop.  Then we went to the pyramids, where the guide briefly explained the history/significance of each and then we were free to roam for about an hour.  Luckily, the moon pyramid was open for the first time in several years so we were able to walk up.  It was such a magnificent thing to see in person.  The sun pyramid (the larger one) was closed but you could still walk up to the base of it.  I will say it was hot af mid day at those pyramids and even though I had long sleeves and a baseball cap I found feel the sun zapping me.  It was also crowded which was expected, but not as crowded as it would have been on the weekend though (I went on a Monday).  After leaving, we bused back towards the city.  We stopped at the Guadaloupe Basilica/Shrine, which wasn't really my thing but I still got out and took a look.

After getting back, I took a nap and then went out for dinner.  Ended up going back to the Lebanese place cause the kebabs were so good.  Then passed out.

  
Day 5:

Decided not to train to the airport and instead pre-ordered an uber to pick up.  Getting through the MEX airport was easy.  I had one snafu cause I had some 35mm film that I wanted hand checked, which took a bit to sort out.  But aside from it was easy.

  
Overall, I had a blast in CDMX and I totally plan to go back.  It felt almost like NYC or Paris in terms of sheer amount of things to see and do and a week really only scratched the service. If you love food/coffee/museums than it's a must visit place.  I was also impressed by their public transit system, only bummer was that there's no app and you had to get a physical card and reload it with pesos.

"Does anyone else keep returning to the same places because nothing else compares? I’m a 26F solo traveler, and I know solo travel is often about exploring new places—but I keep thinking about the ones I’ve already been to and *loved*. The trips that felt magical, meaningful, and unforgettable. The idea of going back excites me more than trying somewhere new.

I could venture out… but what if I don’t love the new place as much? I’d probably wish I had just gone back to Italy. But then again, what if going back *isn’t* as good the second time? It’s like chasing the same magic, with no guarantee I’ll find it again.

For context: I’m a law student in the U.S. with only a few weeks off twice a year, so I try to make the most of every trip. I look forward to them for months and try to fit in as much as I can.

Last summer, I flew into London for a couple days (my usual starting point from LA—direct flights, favorite spots, and friends), then spent four nights in Ibiza, and *then* went to Italy. Ibiza in 2023 with my best friend was one of the best trips of my life, but in 2024 it wasn’t the same. She was constantly on FaceTime with her boyfriend and said she felt sick, so I went to a few shows alone. Some moments were fun, but overall I felt disconnected and low. On the last night, I was packing and crying on the phone with another friend while she was outside talking to her boyfriend.

But I still love Ibiza. I love dancing and electronic music, and even though that trip was hard, it’s one of the few places that truly aligns with the things I love. That said, I’m not sure I’d go back completely solo. Getting ready with someone, dancing with a friend, having someone to go to shows with — it makes a difference there. I could make it work on my own (I actually met a couple of nice solo girls in the crowd one night), but it would definitely be harder.

By the time I got to Italy, I was carrying more than I expected—mentally and emotionally. Being alone in such beautiful places, especially the Dolomites and Lake Garda, felt almost spiritual. Even though the trip was short, it gave me space to breathe. It was exactly what I needed.

I had a similar experience with Iceland. I went for NYE 2023 on my first real international solo trip, and it was magical—Northern Lights, fireworks, that cozy, otherworldly feeling. I was nervous about going back the next year, but it totally lived up. I stayed in different hostels (though I preferred the first one), tried new restaurants—including one I absolutely loved—and explored a new region (Snæfellsnes Peninsula). I saw the Northern Lights again, twice, and much more vividly—once from a hot tub in the middle of nowhere. It felt different, but still really special. I’d go back again in a heartbeat.

Now I’m planning my summer trip… and I’m torn between trying somewhere new or returning to the places that made me feel happy and alive. I’d love more time in the Dolomites. A slower visit to Lake Garda. Another walk to Portofino. More beach time in Cinque Terre. I’m open to exploring new places *within* Italy, but those northern regions keep pulling me back. And maybe I’ll start the trip with a few solo nights in Ibiza again.

I’ve seen a good amount of Europe and don’t feel a strong urge to go beyond it right now. Italy, Iceland, Ibiza, London… those are the places I keep returning to. Even Copenhagen, which I visited for the first time this January, is already on my list to revisit—it was freezing and a lot was closed, but I loved the vibe and want to see it in warmer weather. Even newer places sometimes feel unfinished in a way that makes me want to return, not move on.

**TL;DR:** I know solo travel is often about discovering new places, but I keep wanting to return to the ones I already know I love and experienced magic in—Italy, Iceland, Ibiza, and London—because of how good they made me feel. I’m a law student with limited time off, so every trip needs to count. Anyone else feel this way?",post,r/solotravel,Travel,96.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1krrr7y/does_anyone_else_keep_returning_to_the_same/

"5 Week Trip To Peru and Bolivia, Itinerary Route I am solo traveling South America ( Peru and Bolivia ) , and was wondering if there any must sees that i am missing out of my 37 day trip? Are there certain things that I am not accounting for in my Itinerary?

Salkantay Pass & Machu Picchu: If I have a two-day buffer in Cusco, is that enough time to organize the Salkantay trek and secure a Machu Picchu ticket?

Lima as at the End: I’ve left a few unplanned days in Lima at the end of the itinerary. It felt a bit jam-packed, so I figured I could either use those days to rest or swap/add activities as needed.

Routing Challenges: I typically prefer a flexible itinerary, but it's been hard to route efficiently since I keep looping back to Lima. I'm trying to strike the right balance between having enough to do without overloading the schedule.

Amazon Jungle: I'm undecided on whether to visit the Amazon from Peru or Bolivia. It seems more common from Peru, but I’m open to either.

Must-Do Activities: I definitely want to do the Salkantay hike, sandboarding/buggies, and Bolivia’s Death Road.

Flights vs Buses: I included a lot of flights because I’ve heard negative reviews about long bus rides and also want to manage altitude sickness better.

"I can't speak for Bolivia but your Peru timeline seems fine. The 8-10 hour busses were fine for me (Cruz del sur) but I chose to fly to avoid the longer ones. Domestic flights are affordable (especially if you don't have to check).

Careful booking the Salkantay last minute, they do start to fill up and the most sought after permits go first. It is worth reaching out to a couple companies beforehand. I'm not suggesting booking months in advance but I also don't think putting it off as long as some do is wise. 

Make sure to grab the multi site tourist pass for Moray, Pisac, and other stops in Cusco/Sacred Valley.

"✈️ I Found a Private Jet Booking Platform That Actually Saves Time (and Feels Like First Class on Steroids) I travel often for business, and commercial flights were eating into my time and energy—layovers, delays, crowded lounges. Recently, I switched to booking private flights through **Villiers Private Jets**, and it changed the game.

Here’s why I recommend it:

* 🚀 Access to 10,000+ private jets worldwide
* ⏱️ Book online in minutes—no agents or hidden fees
* 🛩️ Depart from the airport *you* choose, when *you* want
* 💼 Great for business travelers, high-net-worth individuals, and even luxury getaways

It felt like Uber for private jets—just smarter and with a lot more legroom.

I booked from LA to Miami, and the whole process took less than 10 minutes.

I wanted to share a detailed breakdown of what it was like to stay there for anyone considering Punta Mita for a luxury vacation, multigenerational trip, or special event. And I’m happy to answer any questions!

# Who Casa Familia Is Best For

* Multi-generational families
* High-end friend groups or reunions
* Corporate or wellness retreats
* Clients who value total privacy, nature, and effortless service
* Travelers who want a full staff and five-star touches without being in a resort

It’s ideal for those who want to be off the radar, but still have access to Punta Mita’s amenities (Four Seasons, St. Regis, private beach clubs, etc.).

# Villa Overview & Amenities

* 11 bedrooms (mix of king suites and bunk rooms for kids)
* 13,000 sq. ft. across two buildings (Main House + Guest House)
* Massive infinity pool overlooking the ocean
* Outdoor hot tub 
* Private basketball/pickleball court
* On-site spa with cold plunge, sauna & massage rooms
* Pizza oven + outdoor grill
* Media/game room with a separate bathroom
* Full gym
* Kayaks, paddleboards, and snorkeling gear
* 4 bicycles for exploring
* Zoned A/C, water purification system, Wi-Fi, sound system
* Daily housekeeping, full laundry service
* 2 full-time chefs (groceries billed separately)
* Concierge + house manager on-site
* Event-friendly (with advance approval)

The open-air design makes it feel incredibly connected to nature—you’ll hear ocean waves, birds, and breeze all day long.

# Food & Service Highlights

* No menus, no formal schedules—everything is customized to your group
* Casual breakfasts made to order (fresh fruit, eggs, sausage, juices)
* Fresh fish tacos, guac, and salads for lunch
* Special dinners like pizza night (yes, wood-fired oven!) and sunset beach dinners
* Your drink is refilled without asking—it’s that level of service
* Housekeeping is ninja-level discreet. We’d leave and return to a refreshed room every time

# Experiences

* Whale watching *right from the villa’s pool deck* (peak season: Jan–April)
* Surfing at nearby La Lancha (less crowded than Sayulita)
* Access to Four Seasons and St. Regis Punta Mita for lunch or spa via the villa's golf cart
* Sunset drone footage of humpbacks breaching? Yep, we got that.
* Trails for biking/walking around Punta Mita’s 1,500-acre community
* Access to private beach clubs & Jack Nicklaus-designed golf courses

# Logistics & Booking Info

* Located within Los Ranchos Estates – ultra-private and behind *three* levels of 24/7 security
* Approx. 45 mins from Puerto Vallarta Airport (PVR) — arrange private transfer in advance

# Rates (as of 2025 — subject to change)

* Low Season (July–Sept): $14,200/night
* Shoulder Season (May–June): $17,760/night
* High Season (Jan–April & Oct–Mid Dec): $23,100/night
* Thanksgiving: $32,730/night
* Christmas: $39,960/night
* New Year’s: $44,200/night

*Taxes, service charges, and grocery deposits are additional.*

# Best Time to Visit

* High Season (Jan–April, Oct–Mid Dec): Ideal weather + whale watching
* Shoulder Season (May–June): Lush scenery, fewer crowds
* Low Season (July–Sept): Hotter, more humid—but best pricing

We visited in early March, and we got perfect weather every day. 

If you’re looking for a high-end escape where you can fully unplug and still be completely taken care of, Casa Familia hits the mark. The level of service felt like a boutique resort—but with the privacy and personality of a beloved home.

Let me know if you have any questions! Happy to share more details or help if you’re thinking of staying here.

"Casa Familia charges what they charge due to the influencers they let rent it out ;) It’s one of 20 lots in Ranchos that are all next to each other. I personally have a couple other favorites vs this one but this one gets a lot of publicity. 

But please edit as you don’t get access to the hotel amenities. You can make a spa or restaurant reservation, and you can have beach club at St R if you guarantee a min spend but you can’t use the facilities like you’re a hotel guest. 

But how fun that you did the retreat - I love his content! Some Qs: 1) what did you learn from it?
2) While I love his content, how he shoots is the same. So the more I see of it, the more numb I am to just being like oh, another drone shot. Do you think that will become a factor as he gets more widely known and more hotels ask him to shoot that everything will be the same?",comment_1,r/LuxuryTravel,Travel,,https://www.reddit.com/r/LuxuryTravel/comments/1ks81ui/we_stayed_at_casa_familia_in_punta_mita_for_a/
"Thank you for sharing your thoughts. I always appreciate hearing different perspectives, especially from someone who clearly knows the Ranchos community well.   
  
Casa Familia is certainly a visually stunning villa, and I can understand why it’s such a draw for content creators. While it might not be everyone’s top choice, I can see why it garners attention thanks to its layout and aesthetic. 😊  
  
We did note that access to the Four Seasons and St. Regis is limited to dining and spa reservations, but I appreciate you flagging that again for clarity.  
  
As for the retreat, I’m so glad I participated! I walked away with a full presentation of tangible takeaways, from detailed photography and phone settings to 1:1 feedback on drone work and, perhaps most importantly, insight into what our hotel partners actually look for when hiring creators. As an advisor, I found it incredibly valuable to receive hands-on training from someone who collaborates directly with luxury brands.  
  
While I can’t speak for Jeremy’s long-term strategy, I believe his strength lies in delivering visually striking short-form content that resonates with luxury audiences in just 10–15 seconds. It’s that consistency and polished storytelling that keeps hotels bringing him back. That said, the content space is always evolving, and I’m sure he’ll adapt along with it, just as we all have to. Personally, I left the retreat with a new level of respect for what he does. We were pushed to produce and refine our work daily, and his critiques made me grow tremendously in just one week. It’s already made a noticeable impact on how we approach storytelling for our clients moving forward.

"US or Canada - I usually use Napa or Sonoma for what you're looking for.  There are some great estates available for full buyouts with private chefs, daily wine tastings, and then depending on what you're into, you can do hot air ballooning, vineyard tours, spa treatments etc. I also had a group do Jackson Hole, Wyoming.  They have great luxury ranches and mountain homes that can be staffed with chefs and concierge teams. It’s great if your group likes hiking, or wildlife, or spring skiing if you're early enough in the season.  You could even look at Amangani in Jackson Hole or a Relais & Châteaux estate rental in wine country - I've sent travelers to both, because sometimes it's hard to get a staff for the villas and it worked out perfectly.  Whistler in Canada may still have snow at the peaks in April, but by May, you can hike, bike, golf etc.  They have some great modern alpine mansion options with saunas, theaters, outdoor fire pits - great for a group.

"Hi! Many of clients really love the ranch at rock creek for big groups and they have many houses (bear house has 6 bedrooms) as well as really cool smaller cabins if you want to split up but be a two minute walk from each other. There’s so much to do on property and all the activities are completely private to each group and you get two activities a day.

All meals are included and they are delicious especially if you like fine dining for dinner. I know it’s not a personal chef, but it does feel like it as they can make anything you really want. 

I I took a look at availability and it is around 18 to 20k a night for the month of May.

Both places had amazing food, beautiful rooms, and exceptional service. Jade Mountain has no AC bc of the open air concept and can definitely get warm. At Jade Mountain, there isn’t really any “nightlife”. 
For Baoase, you could venture into town if you wanted some nightlife. We have been as a couple to both places, and with other couples as a group to both places and had fun every time. We certainly aren’t honeymooners either and never felt “too old” or that we were surrounded by just couples or honeymooners when we traveled as a group. We went to Cap Juluca in Anguilla (not all inclusive) and did feel it was nothing but couples.

"Looking for a boutique hotel or similar in Portugal Hi all,

I'm looking at taking my wife to Portugal next summer to celebrate her achieving a major professional milestone.  I'm hoping to find a boutique option, ideally on or near a beach, and am coming up kind of empty. We will be traveling with one child under the age of 2, so we'd like the support and amenities/conveniences that comes with staying at a hotel (as opposed to renting a private property). Any suggestions?

For reference, there are two places we have stayed that come to mind in terms of what I am looking for. First is the Azur Lodge in Queenstown, NZ. The Lodge is a collection of maybe 10-15 individual villas, along with one main common area. It had a private chef, an open bar every evening, and incredible service. The staff really wouldn't let you lift a finger there.

The second place I have in mind is the Hotel Wailea in Maui. It's is a Relais & Chateau property and each guest room is a suite. It's a lot bigger than the Azur Lodge but way smaller than something like a Four Seasons. The food was excellent and the service was impeccable.

Many thanks!",post,r/LuxuryTravel,Travel,2.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/LuxuryTravel/comments/1kngatt/looking_for_a_boutique_hotel_or_similar_in/
Sublime comporta,comment_1,r/LuxuryTravel,Travel,,https://www.reddit.com/r/LuxuryTravel/comments/1kngatt/looking_for_a_boutique_hotel_or_similar_in/
"Take a look at Vila Monte Farm House in the Algarve. It’s not right on the beach but close enough for day trips, and it’s got that relaxed, refined atmosphere you expect in Relais & Châteaux properties.  It has whitewashed walls, citrus groves, and a great staff. I sent one of my families there (I’m a travel advisor) and they told me they went above and beyond for families traveling with young kids.

If you need to be closer to the beach, Praia do Canal Nature Resort might work. It’s a a big tucked into a Natural Park, so you’ve got ocean views, a boutique property, and a more remote, peaceful setting. It’s newer, so it doesn’t always hit the radar, but service-wise it’s been getting strong reviews.

Another one with a similar spirit to Azur Lodge is Areias do Seixo—it’s stunning and sustainability-driven.  It is in the dunes north of Lisbon. I was hesitant to send families there because it is more adult-focused but I sent one with a toddler to the villas there and they had a lot for them to do. 

There are some inland options too (like around the Douro or Alentejo), but I think the proximity to water is important here so that should give you an idea.

But, Four Seasons is right on the edge Meads bay which is also a phenomenal beach, you will just have a bit more activity.

Luxury Arrival into the Seychelles 🚁,post,r/LuxuryTravel,Travel,0.0,https://youtube.com/shorts/Qy38hWKVmlE?feature=share
"Private Beach Villa Recommendations 👋 Hello fellow travelers,

We’re planning a special trip for November and are looking for a private luxury beachfront villa that can accommodate our family in style and comfort. Our top choice is Puerto Viejo, Costa Rica, but we’re open to recommendations in Mexico—ideally somewhere serene and not overly commercialized.

What we’re looking for:
	•	5+ bedrooms (we’ll have a group of 15–20 for a few nights toward the end)
	•	Chef services (included or available as an add-on)
	•	Daily housekeeping
	•	Direct beach access or true beachfront
	•	Private pool preferred
	•	Strong Wi-Fi, family-friendly amenities, and a peaceful setting are all important

Budget: $1500–2000 USD per night
Length of stay: 10–14 nights

This is a celebration trip—our 15th wedding anniversary—and we’re hoping to find somewhere beautiful, private, and well-managed. If anyone has personal recommendations or can point us to a trusted villa or property manager in either location, we’d be incredibly grateful.

Thanks in advance for your insight!",post,r/LuxuryTravel,Travel,4.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/LuxuryTravel/comments/1kmjeke/private_beach_villa_recommendations/

"Hi, travel advisor here. While it's not *exactly* what you're looking for, you might want to check out [Hotel Aguas Claras in Puerto Viejo](https://hotelaguasclaras.com/two-bedroom-bungalow-deluxe-new/). The two-bedroom bungalow deluxe is super charming and surrounded by jungle vibes, close to the beach. It's more of a boutique hotel than a private villa, but it’s definitely worth a look.

It’s also part of the FORA Reserve collection, so if you end up interested, I can hook you up with some perks like breakfast, upgrades, etc.

Totally get that you’re aiming for a villa in the $1k–$2k range, which is tough for that amount of people — happy to help you search for something that checks more of your boxes if you want.",comment_4,r/LuxuryTravel,Travel,,https://www.reddit.com/r/LuxuryTravel/comments/1kmjeke/private_beach_villa_recommendations/

"Immigration issues for Indian Travellers Hey everyone, I am new to this sub. As a travel operator in Nepal had come across the travel case for Indian citizen today.

One of our clients was returning to Dubai today but the immigration did not allow him to pass through from Nepal. He was provided a letter that mentioned the NOC (No Objection Certificate) was not given to him by the Indian Embassy.

This is due to the recent war case between India and Pakistan. Even though my client had the Golden Visa for the UAE, he was not allowed to fly off of Nepal. He was not even allowed to go to India.

Please get advice from travel operators to the country you are going to or consult with your embassy.

I think it is the same case for the travellers from Pakistan.

Regards, Naresh.",post,r/LuxuryTravel,Travel,3.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/LuxuryTravel/comments/1kmix3u/immigration_issues_for_indian_travellers/
"I don’t think this is a new rule. I’m an Indian citizen living in Singapore, and this happened to me two years ago. I was flying back from Nepal after a base camp trip when I was stopped at the airport and asked for an NOC.

I had to argue for a while before they let me through. From what I recall, once I explained that I had arrived from Singapore a couple of weeks earlier and was just returning, they checked their records and eventually let me go. It felt pretty absurd at the time.",comment_1,r/LuxuryTravel,Travel,,https://www.reddit.com/r/LuxuryTravel/comments/1kmix3u/immigration_issues_for_indian_travellers/
"Yes it was a few years ago. With tonnes of complaints being raised, the NOC was lifted off. It just happened due to recent activities. Should go away again.",comment_2,r/LuxuryTravel,Travel,,https://www.reddit.com/r/LuxuryTravel/comments/1kmix3u/immigration_issues_for_indian_travellers/
"Hi Naresh,

I understand the complications your client faced while traveling through Nepal, especially with immigration restrictions due to the ongoing political situation. In Sri Lanka, we also face travel-related challenges due to various factors, like visa issues, political instability, or unexpected regulatory changes.

In Sri Lanka, it’s important to ensure that travelers have the necessary paperwork, including visa approval, NOC (No Objection Certificate) if required, and any other documents that may be necessary for international transit. For example, travelers from some countries may face scrutiny due to specific travel restrictions or diplomatic issues, so it’s vital to stay updated on the latest travel advisories from both the Sri Lankan government and the respective embassy.

I highly recommend consulting local travel operators who are well-versed with the regulations and can assist in preparing the necessary documentation to avoid any travel disruptions. Additionally, coordinating with the respective embassies can provide further clarity on requirements for international travel.

For your future travel planning or for any related assistance in Sri Lanka, I would suggest checking out Tourstro. They can provide personalized guidance and make the process smoother for both domestic and international travel.

Safe travels and best wishes for resolving the issue.",comment_3,r/LuxuryTravel,Travel,,https://www.reddit.com/r/LuxuryTravel/comments/1kmix3u/immigration_issues_for_indian_travellers/
"Hi mate, thank you so much for clarifying such case. For Indian citizen this was never the issue before in Nepal. This has come into existence just a few days ago, to the extent I came to know. 

However, the case is almost sorted, the issue happened after the office hours of Indian Embassy in Kathmandu so, I made a few phone calls and got the info that the NOC would be available to him in the first hour tomorrow.

But yep, to everyone, please be careful if you belong to India or Pakistan and is outta country for any purpose.",comment_4,r/LuxuryTravel,Travel,,https://www.reddit.com/r/LuxuryTravel/comments/1kmix3u/immigration_issues_for_indian_travellers/
"What makes a boutique hotel truly unforgettable for you? Hi everyone,



I've spent the last few years working closely with independent luxury hotels in places like Mexico, Spain, Malta and Kenya, not big chains, but small properties with personality, stories and soul.



I'm genuinely curious: what turns a nice stay into something memorable for you? Is it the design? The silence? The human touch? The little details?



I'm collecting insights (no sales pitch, I promise!) to better understand what really moves people when they choose a hotel.



Thanks in advance and if you're curious, I’d be happy to share some of my hotel stories :-)",post,r/LuxuryTravel,Travel,22.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/LuxuryTravel/comments/1km04aq/what_makes_a_boutique_hotel_truly_unforgettable/

They said not to worry leave it with them. They had connections with a renowned glass blowing company who sent a private boat to the hotel to pick us up and return us later in the day.

"Just Back from Borneo:  Rainforests and wild orangutans! One of our Travel Consultants just got back from Malaysian Borneo. If you’ve been thinking about seeing orangutans in the wild, May is a great time. It’s the dry season but not peak tourist season yet, so it is less crowded.

Here’s what we experienced:.

**Kinabatangan River**  
  
Best spot if you're going with family. You take a boat from Sandakan, and you're in the middle of it. There are over 1100 wild orangutans here, as well as pygmy elephants, proboscis monkeys, crocs, and tons of birds. River lodges near Sukau or Bilit are great places to stay for the boat cruises. No trekking is needed, so it’s easy for kids. Pack dry bags and insect repellent. Mornings are best for sightings.

**Danum Valley**  
  
Good for couples or anyone dreaming of a real rainforest experience. This is an untouched jungle with no plantations, and we saw wild orangutans, bearded pigs, and a sun bear at night. There’s a canopy walkway, which is great for observing birds. It’s remote, so plan for at least three nights. Totally worth it.

**Tabin Wildlife Reserve**  
  
A bit more rugged. Fewer tourists. Wildlife comes to the mud volcanoes and saltwater springs. Good if you’re into photography or want a quieter experience. It’s humid and raw but feels very wild.

**What We Packed?**  
  
Light, long-sleeve shirts, Quick-dry pants, Rain jacket. Grippy waterproof shoes or sandals, Binoculars, Insect repellent, dry bags, flashlight or headlamp.

**Best time to visit Malaysia?**  
  
The dry season is from April to September.   
May had good weather and wasn’t crowded

**Who is This Good For?**  
  
Families: Kinabatangan is low-effort and full of sightings.   
Honeymooners: Danum is remote, quiet, and beautiful  
Solo travelers or nature nerds: Tabin or Danum are immersive and less touristy

"Trip review: Luxury Everest Base Camp Trek, brilliant experience First things first, I joined Reddit very recently as a few of my friends asked me to and one of the first subs I joined is this, too, and yeah, loved it every way. No, what about my trip? 

Thank you so so so much for the recommendation of Everest Luxury Holidays from this sub. The team was one of the most fascinating I've ever worked with. I have travelled with a few high-end companies, and this one was for sure different. And what they have been doing in the travel industry of their country, and their team has been doing it locally, is really great. They deserved this review, so I am writing. I have also asked the guy to join this sub, and he might be extremely happy to see these two posts, and I really appreciate them.

Now, about my trip: 

I did the Everest Base Camp Trek with my stay at Luxury Lodges named Yeti Mountain Home up to this place called Debuche. No doubt, their hospitality, in-house services, food, rooms, and everything are just brilliant. I read about these lodges for years, so I always had in mind that if I ever went, I would stay at 'em because lots of WoM. So, to those who are going to experience real luxury in Everest then do not go beyond Debuche on walking. Tbh, the lodges in Dingboche and Lobuche were the worst ones, but we opted for it despite our operator's warning about them. I don't regret doing it cause I really respect what the locals have done in such harsh weather conditions for at least 3-4 months continuously and without the technology the polar countries have. All they have with them is their Bakkhu dress, which is pretty warm, but unwashed for months and tonnes of things.

About my guide and porters: 

Oh boy, never met such humble people who are there just for you, but nothing else. You talk to families, you socialise with 'em, you know how many members their family has, you look at their childhood photo albums, you listen to their dreams and boy, you can hear them talk every day. I think we westerners have forgotten the way of socialisation, it has opened my eyes, and for sure I will promote this idea of conversation for sure to everyone.

Our porters Dhan Bahadur, Shukra, and Padam are super humans. I think we had the total weight of 36-37 kgs, which got divided into 3 different duffels and boy, they carried them the whole day without stopping at places and a lot more. I will talk about the flaws of the situation in the country later on. But maaaaan, it can't be for real that they are not treated well at any place in the trail, they had to go somewhere to sleep, and were not paid enough. But I clearly wanted to know how much they were being paid for my trip; they didn't tell me how much, but I came to know they were paid double the salaries that any other people would be paid. I came to know about it later from Naresh that they were paid NPR 3000 (£20-22) per day, which, by conversion, is pretty hefty for people to earn per day.

About the beauty of the trail: 

Now, about the beauty, no comparison. Been to Canada? Well, it's got too many lakes alongside the mountains, but the Everest region, too many mountains. You walk right on their lap. Every day it's so so so so so beautiful and you can't get enough of them. You question your own existence over these mighty rocks.

But I didn't just hike, in fact. I had pretty good expectations from the operator for what I had read about them, and they met them pretty well. I flew in a helicopter from Kathmandu to Lukla and trekked the same day to Phakding (our plan was a bit ahead to Monjo, but I couldn't walk as my group did). The second day was even harder with around 7 hrs of walking to Namche Bazaar, which made me realise that, well, now I couldn't just walk but even climb Everest, haha. But it was a superb day. Another family-friend couple with us did the bungee jump on the way to Everest. I didn't, though. What made these walks interesting is talking about the history of the region, on how the people from the Hills came and how Tibetans came and how the originals are now living in harmony.

We visited 2 Sherpa Families, one of whom were pretty much lived up to their expectations that never made them come out of the villages. All the males did was become guides or porters, while the females looked after the houses. We had one lunch planned at their house. Now I feel that I have lived my life in so much comfort that observing what life is on the flip side of the world makes me cry. But boy, these people do not want anything, just a normal life, a happy life, food that fills your tummy.

Although the Everest Region is a way commercial trekking route to the extent I experienced, visiting that family hit right at us. Now, if you ask why we went, because we wanted to explore the reality and beyond, and that’s what we planned for.

About the toughness of the trip: 

It is not for the faint-hearted. Do not attempt if you are not well prepared. No matter how fit you are, it is going to affect everybody once you go beyond the tree line. But do not be sceptical about the altitude. If you are well prepared physically and mentally, which is what we pretty much did, got everything on and followed the basics to “eat enough, drink enough, and sleep enough”. Never rushed to walk either. The everyday average walk was of around 5-6 hours, up hills and downhills.

For altitude, we had Acetazolamide (Diamox tablets), easily available in almost every Pharmacy in Kathmandu. We had our guide bought for us.

Hotels we stayed at: 

In Kathmandu, we chose Dwarika’s. Pretty big hotel in size, so expect a lot of people over there. But it was really worth it. Our rooms were deluxe, beautifully architectured with the ethnic design of Newari Homes of Kathmandu. So, this should be your first choice when you get to Kathmandu.

During the trek, we stayed at Yeti Mountain Home. Yeti Mountain Home is a chain of hotels operated by Mountain Lodges of Nepal. They have beautiful properties starting from Lukla itself up to Debuche, actually up to a place called Kongde (I did not go there either, getting there again next year with a different trip, I am suggesting the trip at the end).

Yeti Mountain Homes are really great. Luxurious lodges at those remote areas. Really warm hospitality of the staff. The food is great, too.

But Dingboche and onwards, nothing is luxurious. You have to adjust to whatever you get. Our hotel was pre-booked at Tashi Delek Lodge, an upgraded version of what basic means over there. You get an ensuite bathroom, too, but not so good, and the flush does not work here due to extreme cold, so scooping for flushing is what you need to do. Lobuche is even worse tbh. But I should not complain, as maintaining this is extraordinary.

Our transfers: 

We used the helicopter to go and return. There is the option of twin-otter flight as well, but I heard that to catch the flight, you had to drive early morning, around 4-5 hours and then get it. What if the flight cancels in those places, the hotels might not be good either. Thus, I was from the very beginning suggested to fly in the helicopter, so, did it and it was worth it.

Even flying out was the same case, we flew from Gorakshep in the helicopter to Khumjung, stayed there for a few hours and flew back to Kathmandu. And to anyone hiking here, visit Khumjung on the day of your acclimatisation in Namche. It is one of the most Sherpa villages I saw throughout.

But about the helicopters, be prepared that they might make you wait sometimes. We waited for 2 hours in Khumjung for the heli to arrive. But it was worth it.

About our Operator: 

Yep, I chose the recommendation from this sub and chose Everest Luxury Holidays for my Nepal Holiday from the recommendation by a lady in this sub.

I actually paid a hefty money to the operator to make sure the trip was flexible if I wanted to make some change in the middle that might interest me to elongate my stay, and y'know what they never talked about “we will look into it if it is available, rather they said, buddy, it's not like we cannot arrange two rooms in there, but we need to know a day earlier.” Guess what, there was another post on this sub, too, that asked about the adventure hiking stuff, and I got a rec of a place named Khumjung. I instantly asked my guide Narayan, to see if it was possible to visit the place on return. He made a call, I got the call back instantly, and boom, Naresh agreed to do it. So I extended my day by one more, and I can't tell you how seamless it was.

When I told you we had to wait for the helicopter to arrive in Khumjung for 2 hours, I was not very happy about doing the wait. But the weather in Lukla was pretty bad for them to take off, so we understood the situation and waited. But Naresh connected with me at that time and asked if I would like to meet a Sherpa Climber who has already left climbing Everest for years now. I could not say no to it.

I remember drinking a butter tea (it's basically tea but they put the Himalayan Ghee on it a little bit to keep you warm and call it the butter tea) with Dorji, the climber and talking about his experience, looking at his family. Dorji usually lives in Kathmandu, but at that time happened to be there for a few months because he wanted to stay for a while in his homeland, guarding it and at least farming potatoes in his lands. He had a few relatives alongside him yesterday, and it was pretty great to meet all of them. The wait of 2 hours was nothing while meeting him. And now I know why the previous post about them praised the organisation of the trip so well.

Oh, almost forgot, we were welcomed by a local ethnic musical band at the airport, who did such a grand welcome, they did. Really fascinating.

My last day, today, in Kathmandu: 

Well, I was supposed to be resting today as I am flying out, but I haven’t got enough from this country. I will surely come back next year, I have already paid my deposit to them.

Yes, about today, I got to meet one more family of former Kumari in Patan. Kumari is considered a living goddess in Kathmandu. She is selected by a priest in each of Kathmandu and Patan before her menstruation. I am not going to spoil the history and her selection process. But when I got to meet the former one, I got to know how restricted her life could have been if she had to follow every ritual after her tenure had ended, but now they all live a free life like anybody else. But she is the first to be worshipped in her family before anything else. She is still considered the Goddess by her and her family members, which does not fascinate her every time, but she respects the culture and adjusts to it.

Flaws in the country and the trip:

1.	⁠So many delays are to be expected for flights. To flight out of Kathmandu had a 1.5-hour delay due to air traffic. While flying back, as well as the weather, and air traffic. So, be prepared for it.

2.	⁠⁠Porters: They are the ones who carry everything in the region, from tourists to their loads and luggage. But they are the ones mostly mistreated. I saw many porters even carrying 100+ kgs on their backs. Yet they are underpaid. Proud that my porters were not in such a condition. I was clearly informed that if any baggage is more than 15 kgs, then we had to hire one more person because they did not want to kill them like other people do. And yes, many of them do not even get to sleep at the lodges we sleep at; they are driven away by the owners, like slaves. This was the thing I really hated. Our porters, though, even got the room allowances and were given rooms at the guide and porter section, depending on availability. I really had to raise this issue, so here it is on everything I experienced, and everything made true.

Cost Breakdown: 

Our trip cost was given to us on the basis of 4 people in 2 rooms sharing:

Hotel in Kathmandu (The Dwarika’s): £2,060

Helicopter Ride (the first plan Kathmandu-Lukla-Gorakshep-Kathmandu and additional Gorakshep to Khumjung and connect to Kathmandu): £8500

Trekking cost (Accommodation, Meals, Guides, Porters, Permits, excursions, and activities that needed management like visits with families-donations, monastery entrances): £ 7295

Extra costs (Meals in Kathmandu, Tours in Kathmandu, Guide, Entrance Fees, Transfers, Misc.): £ 2000

Total cost: £19855 (£4965 per person)

Itinerary we did:

Day 1: Arrive in Kathmandu

Day 2: Fly to Lukla and Trek to Phakding

Day 3: Trek to Namche Bazaar

Day 4: Acclimatize in Namche Bazaar

Day 5: Trek to Debuche

Day 6: Trek to Dingboche

Day 7: Acclimatize in Dingboche

Day 8: Trek to Lobuche

Day 9: Trek to Everest Base Camp and fly to Lukla and back to Kathmandu

Day 10: Explore Kathmandu

Day 11: Departure

We re-edited Day 9, flew to Khumjung, stayed there for 1 night and flew back the next day, that is yesterday.

Now my suggestion to do according to Narayan and my next year's trip: 

Day 1: Arrive in Kathmandu

Day 2: Fly to Lukla and Trek to Phakding

Day 3: Trek to Namche Bazaar

Day 4: Acclimatize in Namche Bazaar (go to Khumjung Village)

Day 5: Trek to Debuche

Day 6: Trek to Kongde

Day 7: Fly to Everest Base Camp or Gorakshep and sleep 1 night at Base Camp

Day 8: Fly to Kathmandu or keep 1 buffer day in case weather does not allow the heli to fly

Day 9: Explore Kathmandu

Day 10: Departure

"Have you done Vieques PR?  You get wild horses, bio bays, quiet beaches - in general it’s a more off-the-grid feel than mainland Puerto Rico, but without the hassle of international travel. I’ve sent my travelers to El Blok and Finca Victoria if you like boutique and artsy, or you could rent a villa if you want more space. The local food scene is surprisingly good — a mix of beachy casual and farm-to-table.  I think it as just enough of a local crowd to feel lived-in, not touristy.  If you want to stay stateside, as others have said, Charleston is an obvious choice coming from the East Coast.

"Once You’ve Been, You’re Never Quite the Same: The Long Bay Effect **Once You’ve Been, You’re Never Quite the Same: The Long Bay Effect**

There are some places that you visit, and then there are places that visit you—quietly, wholly, without asking. Long Bay Beach in Turks and Caicos is one of those rare places. You arrive with your suitcase and maybe a few expectations, but you leave with something far more lasting: a feeling that’s impossible to name but impossible to forget.

It doesn’t hit all at once. Maybe it starts when your feet sink into the powder-fine sand, the kind that’s so soft it squeaks beneath your toes. Or maybe it’s when you realize the water changes color every time you glance at it—icy aqua one moment, glowing sapphire the next. It’s mesmerizing, like the island is constantly repainting the sky and sea just for you.

But Long Bay isn’t just beautiful. It’s intimate. Quiet. Almost like it knows the world gets loud sometimes, and it wanted to make space for your stillness. There’s something about the way the breeze carries across the sea grass, or how the palms don’t rush—how nothing here does, really. You start to slow down too. Not just your pace, but your thoughts. Your breath. The way you hold yourself.

Then there are the people. The locals don’t welcome you like a guest. They welcome you like family. There’s a depth to their kindness, a warmth that isn’t performative or polite—it’s personal. You don’t just feel safe here. You feel seen.

And somewhere in that slow, golden stretch of afternoon light, something shifts. You start to understand why so many people come here once and never quite leave—at least, not emotionally. You understand that “vacation” was never the right word. This is something else entirely. It’s coming home to a part of yourself you didn’t know you were missing.

You can try to explain it when you return. You can show pictures of sunsets and turquoise waves and smiling faces. But no photo, no story, no souvenir ever quite captures what it feels like to be changed by a place. That part is just for you.

Long Bay doesn’t demand your attention—it earns your love. And once it has it, you carry it with you. Everywhere.",post,r/LuxuryTravel,Travel,0.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/LuxuryTravel/comments/1kd5chx/once_youve_been_youre_never_quite_the_same_the/

"I stay at The Shore Club -it is the only resort on Long Bay Beach. It is absolutely STUNNING.  Their suites are like an apartment, spacious and well equipped, gorgeous decor.  They have several restaurants on site and the best part is they have a free shuttle that goes to their sister properties, The Sands and The Palms in Grace Bay so you have the best of both worlds.    There are many private villas you can rent for sure.  Yes there are grocery stores and tons of restaurants-but taxi's can get pricey so many suggest renting a car.  Being from Florida, I am definitely NOT comfortable driving on the other side of the road, but I have friends who are part time residents.  As far as Grace Bay-a long term rental I would go for The Regent Grand.  It is a residence style resort and absolutely lovely.

\- The Goring - Old-fashioned luxury hotel. Holds a royal warrant. The late Queen Mother was a regular, and the Princess of Wales stayed there before her wedding. It’s around St James’s Palace, quite secluded.

\- Raffles London at the OWO (Old War Office) - One of the newest luxury hotels in London, on Whitehall, around No 10 Downing Street; National Gallergy’s up the road.

Others to consider: old world hotels like Claridge’s, the Connaught, and the Savoy (on the river); modern luxury like the Lanesborough and the Peninsula; not old world, but not completely modern, hotels like the Dorchester on Park Lane and the Mandarin Oriental Hyde Park.

"Best Places to Experience Culture in Sri Lanka **Kandy**

Kandy is a very special city in Sri Lanka. It has the famous Temple of the Tooth, where a sacred tooth of Buddha is kept. You can also see traditional dance shows and explore local markets. If you visit in July or August, don’t miss the Esala Perahera festival, a big street parade with dancers, drummers, and elephants. It’s an amazing experience!

**Anuradhapura**

Anuradhapura is one of the oldest cities in the country. It has huge ancient temples and the very old Bodhi Tree, which is over 2,000 years old. It’s a quiet and peaceful place where people still do Buddhist prayers. It’s great if you want to see the religious side of Sri Lanka.

**Polonnaruwa**

Polonnaruwa is a city full of old stone temples and statues from many years ago. It’s calm and easy to walk around. You can really feel the history when you visit. This is a good place if you like learning about the past.

**Dambulla**

Dambulla is known for its amazing Cave Temples. Inside the caves, there are many paintings and statues of Buddha. The caves are cool and quiet, and it feels like a peaceful place to visit.

**Jaffna**

Jaffna is very different from the south of Sri Lanka. It has a lot of Tamil culture, with Hindu temples and busy markets. It’s not very touristy, so you can see how local people really live.

I’ve always traveled as a couple. So this will be a new adventure. I’m not up to biking and long hiking lol. I’m excited to meet native people and savor the joys of being in a new environment.

"As far as where to go, I have a few ideas.  

I think you might really enjoy Tuscany. Renting a villa there is lovely because you don't have to constantly pack and unpack, and it's comfortable and safe. You could hire a local driver or join group tours, which is quite common, so you don't have to worry about navigating roads yourself. Tuscany of course is full of incredible scenery, amazing food, and friendly locals.

Provence in France - also beautiful and relaxed, has those charming small towns, amazing food, and a gorgeous  countryside. You could stay near Aix-en-Provence or Saint-Rémy, and again, hiring a private driver is pretty standard and convenient, especially if you're exploring vineyards or local markets.

More exotic (and further depending on where you are coming from) - New Zealand's South Island is another gorgeous option. Queenstown and the surrounding area are incredibly safe and welcoming, with some of the most stunning landscapes you'll ever see. The food and hospitality are excellent, and it's easy to arrange comfortable private tours or drivers.

Japan, (especially Kyoto or Hakone) is incredibly safe, peaceful, and welcoming for solo travelers. Staying in a traditional ryokan inn with a private hot spring is a unique experience, and the food scene there is phenomenal. Plus, locals are genuinely friendly and helpful.

As for planning your trip, I recommend [Evyssa Vacations.](https://www.evyssavacations.com/) They handle all the little details and logistics beautifully. They are very thorough and genuinely care about their travelers.

Italy’s Amalfi Coast and Tuscany provide stunning scenery and delicious cuisine, perfect for a relaxed but unforgettable experience. In France, Provence or Paris has an elegant blend of history, fine dining, and beautiful landscapes, great for soaking in the culture without too much physical exertion.

"Selecting TA at Virtuoso Hi all, 

  
I've been tasked to find TA for our family trip to NY and possibly DC. 

After few hours of research I summarised that Virtuoso network in the way to go for luxury travel, but I'm not sure how to go about selecting the right travel advisor. 

  
What do I need to look for? It is the agent's agency/affiliation, list of travel specialities, how many years they have been planning, or is it just the number of reviews and recommendationsAfter a few hours of research, I summarised that the Virtuoso network is the way to go for luxury travel, but I'm not sure how to go about selecting the right travel advisor? 

  
Also, we will be traveling from EU, would I then look for an agent based near me or in the actual destination city?",post,r/LuxuryTravel,Travel,6.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/LuxuryTravel/comments/1ka2ooo/selecting_ta_at_virtuoso/

It was awful. We got all kinds of junk we didn't need, but were missing a lot of key information at several points. When we needed line items for an insurance claim, the TA was not smart enough to break those out for us....which made me wonder how much we overpaid for things.

"Please help out a fellow traveller! Hello, my name is Anna Thelen and I am in my second year of my master in Excellence in Business and Services, Faculty of Business and Tourism, at the Bucharest University of Economic Studies. 

I am currently working on my thesis and the research for it. This study explores Personalized Virtual Reality (VR) Experiences in Luxury Tourism. As immersive technologies become increasingly integrated into the travel industry, VR has the potential to enhance customer engagement and satisfaction—especially when tailored to individual preferences. Your insights will help me better understand perceptions, expectations, and the potential value of personalized VR experiences in high-end tourism. The survey is entirely anonymous and will take between 5-7 minutes to complete, depending on the individual answer.

I would highly appreciate it if you could spare some of your time. Thank you for taking the time to participate in this survey!

"Is luxury evolving? Experiential nature resorts like Habitas, Six senses, Explora🌿✨ Hey everyone,  
I'm working on an article about experiential tourism and I'm wondering — is luxury changing?  
It feels like a new kind of resort is emerging: places like *Our Habitas* ,etc;  offer exceptional stays in stunning natural environments, focusing more on human connection, cultural immersion, and unique experiences rather than just traditional 5-star luxury.

It seems that offering pure material comfort isn’t enough anymore — travelers today are looking for something more meaningful, without giving up on high standards of comfort.

Has anyone here stayed at this kind of resort?  
What drew you to it? Did it live up to your expectations?  
Or do you think it's just clever marketing in a new package?

"30M - Laos - June 17 to 29 I’ll be travelling solo in Laos from June 17 to 29 and looking for a travel buddy or group to link up with either for part of the trip or the whole thing. 

I haven’t locked in an itinerary yet, so I’m totally open to exploring together, changing plans on the fly, or joining route if it aligns. 

I do have an International Driving Permit, so I’m planning to rent scooters and explore the countryside and towns that way. It’d be awesome to link up with someone who’s down for some two-wheeled exploring, but it’s not a must.

If you’re going to be in Laos around that time or thinking of heading there, hit me up! Could be fun to sync up for a few days or the whole trip.

"Crete, Greece - June 10-24 🌞 Hi there! I'm Mark, 30M and from the Netherlands. I'm planning a two week trip to Crete. I don't mind going there by myself, but honestly it's a lot more fun to share the experience. So I'm hoping to find a positive, open-minded, and goofy travel buddy to join me! 😊

Some things I like to do when traveling: sightseeing and exploring the culture, trying different foods, checking some shops. Hiking in nature, taking nice pictures, swimming, beach days and just soaking up the sun. Maybe a bit of biking or something adventurous. Sipping cocktails, beers and enjoying a bit of nightlife (but definitely don't like a party-hard-every-night kind of trip)

I like to balance activities with downtime - one day could be a full-day trip exploring, and the next might be more chill, maybe some sightseeing in the afternoon and then relaxing. I believe a vacation should definitely also be relaxing and rushing around trying to see as much as possible is not for me.

A little about me: I’m easily distracted by cute animals, so expect me to point them out in the middle of a conversation... I love trying new foods, people-watching, and getting lost in a good board or video game. Other things that make me happy are sipping tea or cocktails, tending to my plants, swimming, and, of course, going on adventures and exploring new places! I have a warm and easy-going personality and hope you do too. Here's two pics of me: [1](https://imgur.com/OAg44vH), [2](https://imgur.com/gUqXpnD)

"What are the most important places for you? I've been to most of the places you mentioned, and I assure you that you won't be able to fit all of it (reasonably) into your schedule.  
I also plan on being out that way, although I planned on arriving later in May and leaving in early July - but i'll be doing a much larger trip in general.

  
I'd also suggest Capital Reef, Goblin Valley, and Canyonlands since you'll be driving by them already and they are definitely superior to a few spots on that list. I'd further recommend nixing Four Corners (tourist trap, unless it has special meaning to you) and RMNP/Sand Dunes/Mesa - save those for a future trip that is Colorado specific. That would make your trip much more manageable (you could spend 1 day at each: Zion, Bryce, Capital Reef, Arches, Canyonland. That gives you a float day for any of the places you like in particular. If you are really interested in sand dunes, coral pink sand dunes in UT is something you'll basically be driving by as well (I believe its a state park IIRC).

I'll give some thought to coming out early and potentially joining for a day or two just for fun; It's always nice to have a buddy. May 26 is also a new moon, and I'm big into Astrophotography - so it'd be cool since you'd be camping and I'd likely stay late into the night. Lastly, it'd be nice to practice my german which I haven't made much use of in over a decade - I could likely uphold a child-like conversation as well as a german toddler on a sugar high, lol.

Give some thought to what I shared - I strongly strongly encourage you to reconsider/prioritize your destinations as the UT parks + CO parks are just not feasible all together in that timeframe IMO.

"Thanks for your reply and recommendations!

The thing is that I leave the country in New York and the next spots on my list are in Texas and New Orleans. Thats why I kind of need to be in Denver at the end of this trip, because I want to take a train / Bus from there.

I got your points with not visiting all of the spots to fit it reasonable in my schedule, that makes sense. Bryce Canyon, Zion Canyon and Monement Valley is probably the most important for me in Utah. The Rocky Mountains in Colorado are also important for me.

Would you still be down for some of the spots in Utah?
We could definitely arrange that with your German:)",comment_2,r/travelmeetup,Travel,,https://www.reddit.com/r/travelmeetup/comments/1jwhgse/travel_buddy_las_vegas_denver/
"Whereabouts in New York? (The city i'd imagine?) Ironically I live in New York (not the city) - if you look up my username it's one of the lakes in the ""Fulton Chain"" of lakes in the middle of the Adirondacks; absolutely beautiful area. I wouldn't recommend visiting until July or August though, as late may and June is black fly season :( Haha.

As for the trip, I'll see if I can make flights and such work! I was already loosely looking at the idea of coming a bit early and hitting a few of the nightclubs; perhaps arriving on the 20th. When you say 25th to 31st, is that starting on the 25th? If so that could work out nicely. I could probably join for a couple days, but then I'd aim to skedaddle back towards Vegas as I anticipate doing my trip clockwise (for weather/climate reasons).

I'll see what I can do, and if it works out, I'll privately message you :D

Edit: Keep in mind I'd be driving my own rental (Since I couldn't join you all the way to Denver) - so you'd still have one spot in your car/it wouldn't help offset costs.

I'll arrive at 5am morning on the 8th from Sydney, and leave late night around 11pm on the 9th, so almost 2 full days in the city.

Other than English I can speak some Mandarin, Cantonese, and a little Deutsche. Clean & sane professional by day, sporty and a little witty by night if you will. Straight to the point no BS. LGBT friendly.

Have soloed many times across Europe and Asia, Taiwan included. No specific plans as I’ve been to most places in Taipei earlier in my life, mostly keen for the food there. Other interest: sports/architecture/music/animals/planes&cars etc.

I’m going to be solo traveling in France from July 4th to July 9th, starting in Paris. I’m hoping to explore the city at a relaxed pace—checking out museums, finding some great food spots, Versailles, and visiting local neighborhoods. I’ll probably try to meet a few locals through bars or Meetup events, but I’d also love to connect with any fellow travelers who might be around during that time to hang out, grab a meal, or explore together!

After Paris, I’ll be heading down south to Aix-en-Provence and then Nice from July 10th to July 19th, where I’ll be meeting up with my brother and sister-in-law. But during that first stretch (July 4–9), I’m just looking to enjoy the city and make some good memories with new people.

"[37NB] Last minute trip to Tokyo / Japan (May 22 - May 28) With an American long weekend coming up and a few extra PTO days available, I happened to find an extremely good flight discount to Tokyo, so I'm heading there in a couple weeks! I land Thursday May 22 at 8pm in Tokyo, and I will leave Wednesday May 28 evening. A friend couldn't join last minute due to passport issues, so I'll be traveling solo.

Flying from San Francisco, and I've been to Japan over 15 times (and studied abroad in Kyoto many years ago).

About me:

* Speak moderate Japanese (enough to get around, but not enough to have political discussions, lol)

* Non-binary/queer, and into LGBTQ+ nightlife & bars

* No food restrictions, and love all sorts of Japanese food; would love a partner for a nice sushi omakase one night

* Not budget restrained, so if anyone wants to do something unique that's a bit pricier, I could be down

* Love adventure, so completely open to ANY itinerary changes (in Tokyo, or all across the country, potentially)

* Anything super unique / weird is a plus (visiting strange bars and niche performance venues is really fun)

* Active and fit (so sports-y activities are totally OK)

* Geeky/nerdy too – video & board games, anime/manga, etc. (been to Akiba many times)

* Unique / subculture clothing shopping can be super fun (big fan of La Foret boutique shops)

* Love cats, so even chilling at a cat cafe is totally fine

* Willing to travel around the country too; I love going to hot springs in the mountains

* Also curious about nailing down an artist to get my first tattoo in Japan",post,r/travelpartners,Travel,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/travelpartners/comments/1klvjc1/37nb_last_minute_trip_to_tokyo_japan_may_22_may_28/

"Irresponsible to go alone? Apologies if this is the wrong subreddit (if so, I'd appreciate direction to a better one).

Am pondering how irresponsible it is, to go deep into backcountry/wilderness for several days, alone. You'll see, in the context below, that I am a decade late in asking this question. But right now it seems both insane and necessary to solo backcountry, soon. My medical/emergency experience says HELL NO, my personal circumstances say, MUST DO. Would value any insight you can offer. Feel free to beat sense into me, as needed. Thanks.

Context 1: Spouse and I are experienced backwoods campers. As an example, our first trip together in \~2002 involved canoeing 5-7 hours a day, for 2 days in, & another 2 days back, to the middle of Algonquin Park, Canada, where there is no cell coverage and no hope of aid. Since then we've made many more deep-backcountry trips. We know a fair bit about emergency preparedness. I'm former medical, with experience in setting fractures and suturing wounds ... and have also worked several years as an Emergency Manager, directing responses to crises such as fires, floods, & violent individuals. Those are different than camping emergencies, of course, but the mindset is similar. In short: I have moderate relevant expertise. Am not an idealistic paddling fool.

Context 2: About 10 years ago, I went backwoods camping alone, including kayaking into an area with no means of communication, against my spouse's advice.  (Full credit to him for standing down, when I said that I felt compelled to do it. That must have been hard.) The trip got hairy a couple of times (see below). I came back feeling chastened about the risks of soloing backcountry, but also feeling renewed & able to cope with what are, frankly, intensely difficult circumstances. at home 

Context 3: During that solo trip, during one of the portages, I emerged from forest to find a moose grazing in the lake at the end of the path, about 20 feet away. For anyone who has never seen a moose, they are so VERY!! much bigger & more powerful than they look in photos. They can trample you to pulp, or crush your car, without breaking a sweat. After a long wait, during which the moose showed no sign of clearing out, I finally rolled myself and all my gear into a tarp, with a plan to continue in the morning. That experience certainly made me think about unavoidable risks.

Context 4: The other scary incident on that solo trip was when I'd set up camp, and went swimming. I swam out to a huge underwater rock, only to realize it had cracked into two (both halves still enormous!) and that it looked disturbingly easy to get a foot caught in the crevice between, which  -- given the location -- would result in drowning and not being found for a long time. Obvs I retreated to shallower and safer waters. Again, this made me think harder about unavoidable risks. This, and the moose incident, deterred me from even considering going solo backwoods, for the past decade.

Context 5: However ... by ""intensely difficult circumstances"" in part 2, I mean, we house a couple of adult kids with multiple disabilities each, and one has tried to kill me &/or spouse, on several occasions. Hospital MDs/SWs have advised it's better to let kid X be discharged to the street, homeless, than to bring them home, because ""it's not IF, it's WHEN, there will be a catastrophic outcome"" (which I think one can reasonably read as: ""they will seriously injure or kill one of you""). Spouse and I call this ""parenting on God mode."" It's hard to describe the intensity of the stress, both daily and existentially. It feels like escaping to the backcountry to recharge, after 10 years of hell, isn't NEARLY too much to ask -- but also, I would only leave if all the necessary supports are in place to keep everyone at home as safe as reasonably possible.

TL;DR: For various reasons, I'm desperately needing an escape from horrible circumstances, and would like to take a solo trip into the backwoods. But also I don't want to be a moron about it. What's your perspective: is it: 1. reckless to go alone, and sheer luck if we survive, or 2. reasonable self-care in the face of unreasonable pressures? Again, am open to having sense beaten into me, lol. <3",post,r/WildernessBackpacking,Travel,4.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/WildernessBackpacking/comments/1kug4rr/irresponsible_to_go_alone/
"I would bet that on a sub like this, you're not going to get many 'oh yeah it's way too dangerous to ever go out alone.'

Like anything, there's risk, and there's how you prepare for that risk. I don't think solo backpacking is any more dangerous than lots of stuff we do without thinking (like driving to the trailhead), but there are some people who prepare for the risk that exists, and some people who are unprepared.

I think going solo into the backwoods is fine. Would highly recommend carrying a satelite communicator like the Garmin InReach Mini 2.

"Avocado oil vs powdered butter I'm headed out for a 12 day excursion this summer. Usually I pack powdered butter because it's easy and light but in my real life, I avoid butter, usually opting for Avocado oil because of the benefits to my arteries. I've avoided carrying any oil in the past because I don't trust any bottle to actually contain it, but I've just seen some old posts that recommend using plumbers tape or purchasing a ""smile"" container, so oil is on the table for me now. My question to the community is, in your opinion is the health benefits worth carrying the extra weight?

"What would you have done?  I need advice about how to manage risks around losing a cellphone # questions:

  
What precautions do you take in case your cellphone bites the dust or goes missing on a long multisegment hike? If your sudden lack of a working cellphone meant you had no access to social media, your digital contacts or phone book, the web, far out, or what not, how would you alert a friend or family of your distress? Assume that you do not have a backup cellphone, and that your GPS device does not have the contact info of the people you need.

If you could either finish your trip without a cellphone and then try to hitch, or immediately hitch to fix the cellphone issue, which one would you do?  


# some of the solutions I can think of: 

* write down several names and numbers of friends or loved ones (I'm not married) on durable media inside my pack someplace, and/or memorize
* write down google password in the same way



# story:

I just got back from a two-week backpacking trip that had an unexpected ending.

I started at Big Creek in the Great Smoky Mountains National Park (USA, TN/NC). I walked six days and 95 miles along the Benton MacKaye Trail (BMT) to Fontana Dam, where the BMT intersects with the Appalachian Trail. I was out of battery and backup battery by the time I arrived. However, there are a great number of amenities at Fontana because it is an important resupply stop for the vast and ever-increasing number of AT hikers. I got to the hotel where I was going to take a zero just fine.  
  
I'd had similar experiences on the only other long multisegment hike I went on, which is the PCT. If I was out of juice for a cellphone, or even trashed my device entirely, there were lots of other hikers around to help and/or amenities (shuttles, hostels) to fix the situation.

But six days after leaving Fontana on the BMT, and seeing no one for days, I arrived at TN-68 just trail south of Unicoi Gap with a cellphone that had no power and no service. I could not call for a ride. I hitched 2.5 miles to a restaurant/rv park I'd sent a resupply package to.

When I got to the restaurant, I realized with horror that I no longer had the cellphone. To simplify, it turns out that the place someone else had called ""hiker friendly"" didn't really like me, a smelly hiker, and was pretty annoyed with me. I did pick up the resupply package. I tried to figure out if I should walk forward, no phone, only maps, if I should impose upon the (seemingly irate) restaurant/campground manager to help me find someone to call, or what? They didn't tell me they wouldn't help, but they seemed annoyed and disinclined. 

I used the restaurant phones to call some shuttle services but got no traction. I thought about going on to the next hop, two days away, which is at a place called the Ocoee Gorge that is highly trafficked by whitewater dirtbags and hiker trash, but I was getting freaked out that I might get there and be in the same predicament.

I ended up leaving the next morning at first dawn after the owner told me I was a pain in the ass and a burden. I hitchhiked back towards Knoxville, the nearest major city, also my home, which is about 90 minutes away. I got a good hitch on the first try, but I was really worried that without a cellphone I'd end up wandering about practically without an identity or a way to contact anyone who could help. 

This was in my own backyard, but I'm definitely aware of people who just get lost far away and can't contact their friends again to get home or prove their identity. In the US, people even get caught up with the police and jail because of such things. How would I have recovered my phone data and passwords if I had, for example, been on the Continental Divide Trail or even trekking in New Zealand? Who would have helped me?

Am I too freaked out about this? What strategies, aside from not leaving my cellphone in a hitch, should I undertake to mitigate risks that emerge from a lost cellphone?",post,r/WildernessBackpacking,Travel,0.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/WildernessBackpacking/comments/1kupoab/what_would_you_have_done_i_need_advice_about_how/

I keep my cell phone separately from my little baggy of cash, ID and Credit card.  So losing my phone, while inconvenient, would not stop me from being able to get home, continue my trip, or handle police asking me for ID.

"Trail Shoes VS Boots Hello! 

Me and a few friends are doing a 4 day trip in Jackson hole in August. We’re doing Rendezvous Mountain to String Lake. 

I’ve never done a backpacking trip before and don’t know what’s appropriate. 

I don’t want to go crazy and spend A TON of money for my first time out. 

With that said, are trail shoes adequate for a trip like this or is it recommended to have boots? 

I’m not a stranger to distance running - I ran a marathon a few months ago but I do know road races / distances are VERY different than trails. 

Any input is appreciated!",post,r/WildernessBackpacking,Travel,0.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/WildernessBackpacking/comments/1kuicsz/trail_shoes_vs_boots/

"I'm assuming you have a pack? It wasn't listed but I would hope you didn't forget about that essential part! You might also think about having an inflatable or packable pillow, unless you plan on using clothes or something which a lot of people do. Now for critiques, where are you going for trips? Unless you are in grizzly territory or in area that requires it,  bear canister isn't always necessary. In most black bear areas you can just do a good bear hang with a food bag. I'm only mentioning this because those bear proof cans are heavy, I don't take one unless I have to. Also I see two pads listed, as far as I know the tensor all season pad is just like it sounds, you can get by with it all year round. You shouldn't need two pads when the one already has an r value over 5, unless you're doing some crazy mountaineering or something.

"Need advice on first camping trip Hi guys. I'm a 25M from Delhi, India. I have been planning to go to this isolated village Milam in uttarakhand. The elevation is about 4250m above sea level. And its really high up in the himalayas. It used to be a bustling trading town before the 1962 Indo-sino war. There is an Indian Army outpost nearby there too. The trek is from the most nearby town Munsyari, it's almost 50ish km. I am thinking of camping in Minal. I am pretty excited to practice bushcraft and living on my own for 5 days there, but I don't have any camping experience. I am renting most of my gear (tent, sleeping bag, cooking stove etc.). But mostly my only worry is the wilderness there. Since Milam is high up in the himalayas and is away from civilisation, there is a lot of fauna in the nearby areas to it, there is a national park nearby too. The elevation area of the himalayas is known to have black bears, snow leopards, pit vipers. Although there have been no reports of finding them in Milam, but it is in the biodiversity area.

"We have Black Bears and Big Cats here in the Rockies; so I can base some advice around that.

1) You need to rethink this whole trip, 5 days of back country camping is a lot for a first trip, let alone solo. You’re lucky there is an army base nearby, because it’s very likely you’ll need to be rescued, or bail and leave all your gear behind crawling out suffering elevation sickness.

2) Elevation is no joke, and 4250m/13,000ft is going to be brutal coming from ~300m/1000ft. Expect painful headaches.

3) Do not eat near your campsite, 30m/100ft is a good starting distance. Bears and Big Cats will be attracted to your food smells, and general camp odors.

4) Keep your camp and eating area tidy.

5) Be Noisy, talk to yourself, stomp around camp, just be generally noisier than usual.

5) Double check with someone more familiar with the area (that NPs rangers?), our local pit vipers (rattlesnakes) typically don’t live far into the mountains, it may be similar in your area.",comment_1,r/WildernessBackpacking,Travel,,https://www.reddit.com/r/WildernessBackpacking/comments/1kttv0r/need_advice_on_first_camping_trip/

"That's plenty of money. Spend it most on three areas that must fit and be comfortable: 

1. Your feet - shoes and socks. 
2. Your backpack - get it fitted by someone who knows what they are doing. Do not buy blind. 
3. Your sleep system - pad, bag, plus I'm a big fan of liners.  

Don't fall into an ultralight *trap*. There are a lot of very active, often passionate UL people. Many who will insist it's the only way to go. But UL is a thing unto it's own. A full system. One doesn't just dive head first into the UL world. 

90 liters is a huge, enormous pack in today's backpacking world. A great deal of people can go a week in a 60 L pack without too much of a problem. Some can do it in a pack under 50L.

"Help replacing straps on a vintage German alpine rucksack? I picked up a vintage German alpine rucksack (photos attached). Canvas body, metal fittings- great shape overall, but the original straps are missing.



I want to fit it with comfortable, padded canvas straps (preferably not nylon/polyester). The top has metal loops, and the bottom has clamp-style hardware for threading. The straps need to be 2cm wide.



I plan to:

* Use cotton canvas webbing (2cm)
* Add some cushioned padding
* Use buckles at the bottom for adjustment



My questions:

* Should I thread the top loops or use clips?
* Is doubling webbing for strength worth it?
* Are there any UK or international sources for canvas webbing, cushioned padding, and hardware?



I would love tips from anyone who has done similar projects or knows about vintage rucksacks.

"You can find cotton canvas webbing online. It might take some searching to find 2 cm.

I'd sew the webbing onto the top metal loops. Then run it down to the ladder buckle at the bottom.  Make sure the webbing you get works with the buckle before you sew it on - they can be picky sometimes.

I think I'd make the shoulder strap pads so that they slide on the straps, so you can adjust them. I'm picturing canvas oblongs, like three inches wide by a foot long - two layers each side. 

Not sure about what to put inside for padding. Something appropriate for that time would be kapok, but it'll be sewn inside so you can't see it. Anyway, put the padding in between two of the oblongs, and sew a lighter weight fabric edging around the perimeter - like is done on the edge of the top flap on the pack.  

You'll end up with two shoulder pad shaped things. Then sew another piece of the webbing about 4"" long, from side to side on each end of the shoulder pads to make a loop that lays flat against the shoulder pad - so you can slide them over the straps you sewed on the bag already. I'm sure that's all clear as mud...

You might look at some websites with weird surplus packs on them and see if there is one that it looks like you could swap the straps off of. Might work (might not).

"Wife approved solo backpacking hall-pass. What is your Lower 48 One Trip to rule them all? So me and the wife are planning on having a second child in about 2 years and we came to conclusion that with two young kids in the house, it will be a long time before I have the chance to howl at the moon on a solo trip again. Having our son so far is already a massive time constraint.  As much as I love him and taking him on day hikes and future short backpacking romps, I never got to take the BIG, Solo mountain west trip, which as a North East backpacker, has always been my dream. She feels the same way too about her bucket list trip dream trip (hers is not backpacking related). So, we agreed that over the next year and a half or so we're going to give each other one bucket-list solo trip: One trip to rule them all.  Please help me pick.

The constraints:

Lower 48 States. 5-days of actual trail time. 100 miles or less if on trail, 65 miles or less if off trail. I currently do 20-25 mile days in the Adirondacks and The Whites pretty consistently. I run 7-10 miles a day. So given the trail condition/altitude trade-off, I think I can maintain that pace out west. I'd like a nice mix of big mountain passes, conifer trees when low and alpine lakes and tundra up high. I will be going Late August or early September. Views... Also, I'm perfectly fine with heavy black bear activity but I'm kind of afraid of grizzlies- not enough to deter from a trip. 

So far I'm debating between Andrew Skurka's Yosemite High Route - The Southern Loop Section and the Teton Crest Trail. The YHR: 65 miles, a significant chunk off trail. Yosemite back country needs no explanation. this trip would be hard, remote and glorious. The TCT: Looks epic but a little short for 5 days on trail. Also considering the High Sierra Trail, and something in The Winds. 

  
Any advice would be awesome and feel free to throw in a trip I've overlooked.",post,r/WildernessBackpacking,Travel,134.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/WildernessBackpacking/comments/1ks55ix/wife_approved_solo_backpacking_hallpass_what_is/

I would also consider the Tahoe Rim Trail,\* but again, wildfires. Generally speaking, if you're traveling from afar, the sooner you get out in California after the snow melts, the better).

I have backpacked  and horsepacked most of the Winds over about a 40 year period and taking a horse in for the first day is worth the effort to get lined up. With the right outfitter you can stay at their place on the edge of the wilderness and go first thing in the morning after a big breakfast. It really adds a whole dimension to the experience and puts you at altitude at the end of the first day.

"I have 100 backpacks, headlamps, and sleeping pads/bags and don’t know what to do with them I turned my passion for backpacking into a business back in 2018 and ended up planning backpacking trips and outfitting over 1000 people.  It was a great experience!

Fast forward 7 years.. I closed the business. I now have a ton of backpacking equipment. Many of the items have only been used 1-3 times because I frequently sold gear and ordered new at wholesale prices to keep it fresh.  Backpacks, sleeping bags, sleeping pads, headlamps, Nalgenes, maps, new pillows, trekking poles, food, etc.

I’ve tried slowly selling it off and have had friends help me, but I’m selling my house now and I refuse to move all this equipment anymore.  So what can I do with it all?

Does anyone have ideas?  I’d prefer to monetize it somehow, as I never made much from the business.  The gear accumulated while my bank account depleted haha.. If I absolutely cannot find a way to monetize it quickly, I’d be open to donating it if it was a good cause.

It's a National Shoreline so it's run by the NPS so you do have to make backcountry reservations and book the shuttle if you want it (I parked, shuttled to my starting point, and hiked back to my car over 3 days). I took my partner-at-the-time there for a short section of trail along the National Shoreline for his first backpacking trip. It was one of my favorite 3 day, 2 night trips it was so beautiful!

"Sleeping bag advice needed I am most definitely not the first or last to make a post like this in here. Sorry about that. But I could really use some advice. I have been browsing sleeping bags for weeks now. Both in local shops and on the web. I just can't figure out what to buy.

I have mostly been hiking, but I am getting more and more into mountaineering. I have done some smaller mountain hikes (Norway, Switzerland, Iceland and more), and also a short ice climbing course. I am not planning anything crazy, but I would like to slowly level up a bit, doing multiday trips and to get some experience. E.g. I am planning to do Monte Argentera(Italy) this June. Also I am going to travel a lot with my job the next year. Going for both Greenland, Canada, Alaska and Seattle. So there is definitely going to be some good opportunities there as well. At least some hiking.

That brings me to the point. I think I am looking for something in the comfort temperature around -5C/25F give or take. Guess that will be roughly temperature limit -10C/15F. Something a bit versatile. I am not planning to sleep super cold any of these places, so I guess a good warm 3-seasoner should be fine? Please let me know if you think something else. My Dream is to someday do something similar to MT. Rainier when I get the experience, but I don't know if that would require a new sleeping bag anyways?

I of course also want it to be light and compact(when packed), however I tend to get a little claustrophobic in those super tight mummy bags. Also it is a huuge plus, if I can zip up in the foot area. As my feet tend to get very hot while sleeping.

I have of course been looking a lot at different bags already. I have narrowed it down to a few I find interesting. But at the same time I also see some cons with all of them:

[Sea to Summit Ascent Down 15](https://seatosummit.eu/en-dk/products/the-ascent-down-sleeping-bag?srsltid=AfmBOoqo0AQsSYrmsk1m2tO3wxsDpOvq7GfNYUwhHM3RGuxOy7-PLKwj) can get it for around $375

\+: Has a ton of zip features(can open at the feet), has descent weight(1200g), and packs somewhat small(8L)  
\-: Maybe too much zippers going on? Questionable quality? A little camping like maybe? Expensive compared to what it is

[Western Mountaineering UltraLight](https://www.westernmountaineering.com/product/ultralite/) Can get it for around $465

\+: Seems like super good Quality. Very light(880g). Can zip up almost in the bottom, so my feet can get some air at least.  
\-: Expensive. Is a bit slim maybe. Doesn't come with compress bag, so have to buy that on the side. I have heard it doesn't compress that well either(9L?).

I have looked at several other brands and models (like Marmot, Feathered Friends, Therm-A-Rest and so on) but these two are probably the best options I have found so far. But none of them seems to be really perfect either. I am not necessarily on a super tight budget, but I think the UltraLight is close to my limit of what I would like to spend. Also i am 187cm (6'1.5"") tall, so I guess I need the long version of all sleeping bags.

I hope some of you might have some good input? Have you tried on of the bags? Do you know of some better?

"First trip is going to be chilly Going on my first backpacking packing trip this weekend in Shenandoah and I worried about being cold. It’ll be 45F on Saturday night and 50F on Sunday night. 

If the warm gear I have isn’t enough, what would you recommend getting? 

I have: 
- thermal layer 
- Mummy sleeping bag (rated to -4C)  
- Sleeping pad with R value of 4 

To clarify: I think I have enough to be warm safety-wise, but I want to be comfy. I’m used to car camping and being able to pack everything I might need!

"I had a mountain lion encounter This past week me and a friend were hiking in Yosemite. We got to the top of the 3 mile round trip hike at dark. About 1k ft elevation climb. The sunset was great up on the peak. We then started down the trail back to the car. Only 1.5 miles to go.

About .5 miles down the trail we heard something running in the woods. We looked around and saw some eyes uphill from us looking down at us. Probably 50yds away. We remember the eyes being very close together and big and low to the ground. We talked and shined lights in that direction for 5 mins before heading down further.

Then .1 miles before we get to the car we see 10 yards ahead and uphill of us the same eyes. Low to the ground and big. It was in a bush staring at us. Now we noticed the light colored hair and recognized it as a lion. We yelled at it and after a couple minute stare down it headed uphill and away.

What scares me now is backpacking alone in Yosemite. I have been backpacking alone for years but this encounter leaves me edgy. What if it had just been me and not the two of us? The lion trailed us for about a mile and we never even saw it until the end of the hike. I’m just really scared to go solo backpacking now even though I have some awesome hikes I want to do.

I’ve had mixed responses when I tell ppl this. Most are like “perfect time, gonna be nice up there”. But I’ve also gotten some “oh $hit are you sure you wanna do that, it’s late in the season!”

Am I crazy for planning a thru hike that late in the season or are the alarmists off base?

I get that it will be cold at high elevations, and I’m prepared for that. I get that there could be snow, and I will be prepared for that, and fully prepared to know where my bail out points are if a big dump comes thru. Also fewer daylight hrs. Etc.

"It’s actually a super time to go if you’re prepared.  I’ve been out many times at that time of year in the Sierra.  Over a 2-3 week period there’s a good chance for precipitation but probably nothing substantial that might only delay you a day or two.  And otherwise shorter and cooler days but a great chance for mostly sun!  As others have mentioned resupply is more challenging but still possible.

Only once was I caught where being over a day from a trailhead and then a major dump of snow (nearly 3 feet).  That time I bailed out after staying the night in the storm and then got out when the weather cleared up some in the next days; and with today’s forecasting that kind of size storm I would have knowledge of even in the mountains using my Garmin.

Multi-day storms are rare. And, so, relatively speaking, are other hikers. 

The one issue I didn’t quite prepare myself mentally for on the JMT was the reduced amount of daylight. I had to overcome my innate resistance to making camp as early as I needed to.

"Struggling to put together a backpacking itinerary in Cascade Pass - Overwhelmed by information I landed upon information for Cascade Pass & Sahale Arm on the WTA site, but I'm at a loss for actually piecing this together as a trip. My friend and I are semi-experienced backpackers and are looking to do a 4 - 5 day trip in mid August. We are prioritizing mountain views & forests; bonus if we can get to old growth forest around Beaver Lake Loop. We would be flying out to Seattle and taking a rental car.

  
I must not be looking in the right place, but I can't find a solid map of all of these trails to see if I could do this trip as a loop (8 - 12 miles per day) OR an out & back.. Does anybody have any suggested itineraries we could follow along with or resources I could use to map this trip out?",post,r/WildernessBackpacking,Travel,2.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/WildernessBackpacking/comments/1krjwke/struggling_to_put_together_a_backpacking/
"Use Caltopo to plan your routes. You can create routes and view distance/gain as well as a variety of helpful overlays like slope angle, etc. You can also use the USGS topo overlay to see those useful maps. Here's Caltopo centered on Cascade Pass:

[https://caltopo.com/map.html#ll=48.47813,-121.055&z=14&b=mbt](https://caltopo.com/map.html#ll=48.47813,-121.055&z=14&b=mbt)

To answer your Q: No, you can't really connect those two areas in the time you have, and if you had much longer and DID connect them, it would be a LOT of not very exciting valley walking.

Cascade Pass and Sahale Arm are definitely worth seeing, but I don't know of any loops you can do that incorporate it. The popular thing to do is to hike from Cascade Pass into the remote village of Stehekin and hang out there, then head back. Thats about 23 miles from Cascade Pass trailhead to High Bridge, where there's a little shuttle that runs into the settlement.

What you might want to do is just dayhike Cascade Pass and up Sahale Arm (where the best views are), and do a shorter backpack elsewhere.

If you want a classic Cascade backpacking loop, a good one is the Spider Gap/Buck Creek Pass loop in the Glacier Peak Wilderness, which is as good or better than anything in a National Park

"Working remote all summer. Where to base myself from? Hey guys  — I’m in a unique window of life and could use your help picking where to go next and the best trails. 

I’ve been living the remote semi-nomadic life for 2–3 years now, and my company is calling me back to the office in mid October. So I want to take full advantage of these final 4–5 months working remotely by living in places with world-class hiking access.

I work Monday through Friday, 7 AM–4 PM (PST) I live out of Airbnbs, short-term rentals, or tent camp out of my Subaru Outback (could throw a mattress in there but I'm fine dispersed tent camping). If I camp, I work from coffee shops or libraries — I just need Wi-Fi or cell service for my hotspot within ~20 minutes of where I sleep. I can spend $2,000/month or less (basically acts as my rent) or go dirtbag-style if needed. I’m perfectly fine bouncing around every 1–3 weeks

My goals this summer:
1. Pick a place where I can do after-work hikes (4 PM–10 PM) a few times per week
2. Do epic weekend backpacking trips. I get off work at 4 so ideally it's within an hour or 2 where I can knock out some miles Friday night. Then hike Saturday and hike back out Sunday night. I can take a couple long weekends if I want. Saving some of those for some week long longer backpacking trips. 
3. Live in beautiful, wild places that are hard to access once I’m stuck in an office

I've done a lot of places the past couple years. I spent a month in Kalispell area to go to Glacier on the weekends (and some day hikes in the area), in Yosemite foothills city area for the valley in spring (I'm from SoCal so this is my home area) camped around Utah, etc. My favorite has been an Airbnb for a month in Alaska simply because there was so much unbelievable hiking to do and sundown wasn't until 11pm so I could do epic hikes on work nights. I'm tempted to go back there but it seems all the good stuff is hard to pack in a weekend. Have done just weekend stuff in the Tetons, Banff, and some others. 

Places I’m considering bouncing around every couple weeks 

	1. Eastern Sierra, CA (June/July) – Tons of weekend backpacking options that I've done a bit of. Maybe Tahoe is best for after work hikes and mammoth area for backpacking? 

	2. Beartooths – place I haven't been. Considering maybe the red lodge area? 

	3, Tetons – great camping outside the park. Close enough to hike?  Places to work? 

	4. Canmore/Banff, Canada – Explored for a weekend, loved it. But expensive; I’d camp. Any good Canada recs? 

	5 . Crested Butte or Ouray, CO – steep hikes, big views, not sure about post-work trail access or epic backpacking 

6. Back to Alaska 

International (for August/September?): 
	I've never been hiking abroad. But thinking it could work. I would be working 4pm-11pm which would leave weekday mornings/afternoon for hiking 

- Switzerland or French Alps – Thinking Chamonix or somewhere. Worried it won't be a wilderness feel but could be cool to do parts of the Tour de Mont Blanc
	•	Norway? Could be a wilderness feel with decent transportation? 
	•	Iceland? No idea where to base out of

"Several suggestions of Bend. I’m partial because I live here, but the smaller town of Ashland has access to the same Cascades (south of Bend) as well as multiple PCT trail heads, both in Oregon and California, which is 14 miles south. Southern Cascades are 30 minutes in one direction, Siskiyou Mountains 30 minutes in another direction. 

Dry, mild summer weather, tho wildfires can some years spoil the party—same as many of these mentioned. 

PCT access, Marble Mountains, Trinity Alps, Russian Wilderness, Kaliompsis Wilderness, Sky High Lakes, within an hour or two, depending on the trail head. Not the high altitudes of the Sierra, most in the 5,000 to 7,000 ft range, which makes the weather more predictable and not as many afternoon thunderstorms.

It’s a low population region of Oregon and California, so not as crowded as the Sierra, with the exception of the PCT which can be busy. 

Great small town, as well, with lots of coffee shops, Oregon Shakespeare Festival, campgrounds and short term rentals, due to the tourism OSF generates.",comment_2,r/WildernessBackpacking,Travel,,https://www.reddit.com/r/WildernessBackpacking/comments/1krk7wm/working_remote_all_summer_where_to_base_myself/
"Not necessarily in this exact order although Stanley ID, one of the WY choices or Leavenworth area in WA would be my top choices. Even though you can't go wrong with any of these. 

Stanley Idaho. Epiccc sawtooth/white clouds/frank church/the Bitterroots hiking. Yearsssss worth. World class fly fishing. Stunning. Remote. 

Durango Colorado. The San Juan mountains are fucking incredible. Fishingggg. Also close to Utah hiking. 

West Yellowstone area/Gardiner or anywhere near this. Because, Yellowstone is incredible, but more importantly ALL the backpacking directly around it. Lifetimes of backpacking. Yellowstone. Beartooths. Lee Metcalf. Tobacco Roots. On and on and on. World class fishing. Beautiful scenery. 

Jackson WY of course. It's not just Teton NP. You got legendary backpacking alllllll around it. The Teton Wilderness area is massive. The Gros Ventre Wilderness. The wind river range. Topppp tier shit everywhere. Fishingggg haha. 

Leavenworth WA. Same theme man. Just endlessssss amounts of epic hiking. North Cascades. Alpine Lakes wilderness. Pasayten Wilderness. Mt. Baker. Mt. Rainer. Goat Rocks. Olympics not even far. Arguably this location would give you the most access to insane amounts of variety. That said, lot more people. Fishing is good but not as world class as the others. Significant more access to bigger towns/cities. WAs backpacking is fucking incredible. North Cascades alone...called the American Alps for a reason. 

Bend OR would be solid. Although personally I don't think the hiking is as epic as all the above. 

Joseph OR if you want to crush the Eagle Cap wilderness which is great. Also reasonably easy to access good chunks of ID within reasonable drive.

"New Forest Service Chief Tom Schultz wrote a white paper a few years ago about his ideas on National Forests.  He did not call for selling the lands or massive resource extraction.  Instead, he called for a different approach of remaining in federal ownership, but with administration by the states within the guidelines set by the feds.  He claimed the states did a better job managing their own state forests than the feds did managing the National Forests, with some states actually showing a profit.  There are some holes in his claim, notably most state forests are very high quality timberland, with the National Forests having lower quality timberland and a lot of non-productive land (many National Forests were created from the leftover public lands that private timber companies did not want), and the Forest Service is obligated by law to provide for wilderness, wildlife, recreation, and other low-revenue non-commodity products.  Most state forests are managed to maximize timber production with any other use de-emphasized or given token lip service.        

His model is not too different from the campaign position statements of Al Gore in 2000 and John Kerry in 2004, that also called for greater state involvement in federal land management.",comment_1,r/WildernessBackpacking,Travel,,https://www.reddit.com/r/WildernessBackpacking/comments/1kr4ehg/today_may_20_1pm_ama_on_protecting_public_lands/

Also, you'd be looking down a sweet bed of lakes. This hike isn't even that far and is a natural scramble from 4th of July Creek TH. If you were ambitious, you could continue the ridge walks north or east; albeit much more harrowing at that point. 

Parks Peak and Imogene peak would provide wonderful view.   
Snowyside, Perfect Peak and El Capitan are all on a ridge walk and not all that crazy.   
 

There aren't a lot of high country ridgeline style trails in here due to the nature of the peaks and the ridges themselves. They're often very jagged making traversing ridgelines more of a peak bagging scramble effort. 

The Sawtooths are not Yellowstone/the Greater Tetons/Portions of MT in the sense where there's large open ridgelines you can walk with sweeping views everywhere. The Sawtooths sweeping views come mostly in the way of climbing straight up the jagged ridge itself/towards a peak.",comment_4,r/WildernessBackpacking,Travel,,https://www.reddit.com/r/WildernessBackpacking/comments/1kriz96/sawtooth_recs/

"first time solo trip adivce hi backpacking,

I'm a pretty regular hiker and solo camper, but I haven't had any experience backpacking yet. It's something id love to try and I recently was given some gear so I'm looking to try to do an over night in the Catskills memorial day weekend, but none of my friends have the gear to join me. 

Is trying my first night solo a bad idea? I'm very familiar with the area and have camped at proper camp grounds solo before. I'm hoping that there may be a busy weekend and I'll be able to meet up with other campers. 

Looking for any advice or thoughts! Here's my gear list so far, would love any advice to fill in what I'm missing:

-Pack

-tent

-sleeping bag

-foam pad

-headlamp  

-stove & propane (need to get)

-bear bag? (need to get)

-first aid and toiletries kit",post,r/WildernessBackpacking,Travel,4.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/WildernessBackpacking/comments/1kra0y1/first_time_solo_trip_adivce/
"REI has a really great gear checklist that I use. 


For your list, main thing I see missing is water. Do you have a water filtration system? 


I'd also take a good inventory of your clothing, so a rain jacket and layers like fleece/down jacket. 


Another would be some sort of power bank for your phone or GPS. ",comment_1,r/WildernessBackpacking,Travel,,https://www.reddit.com/r/WildernessBackpacking/comments/1kra0y1/first_time_solo_trip_adivce/
"A life straw works, water filtration tabs work, sawyer squeeze works. Test it out before you get out into the backcountry so that you know if you like how it works or tastes.  Make sure you know if there's agricultural runoff, a lot of dirt in the water, or giardia where you're going- that changes what you need your filter to do.",comment_2,r/WildernessBackpacking,Travel,,https://www.reddit.com/r/WildernessBackpacking/comments/1kra0y1/first_time_solo_trip_adivce/
"Go enjoy the trip!

If you are backpacking on a regular maintained trail, you probably won't be alone.  There will be other hikers on the same trail.  In case of mishap someone will be along shortly.  Realistically, what are the chances of a mishap?  Have you had an accident requiring assistance when with a group?  The odds of needing assistance are about the same when solo.   

After you get comfortable solo backpacking on a popular trail, choose a lesser used trail or the off-season.  More solitude. Eventually you may want to start solo off-trail.  Then it becomes both exhilarating and sobering.  The solitude and personal accomplishment are magnificient, but in case of mishap you are on your own.  Almost no chance someone else will come along and even under the best circumstances SAR will be days away.        

Upsides of solo hiking:  You set your own pace, stop and break when you want, set up camp where you want.  Change routes as you want.  Don't have to listen to snoring or farting all night.  

Downsides:  You carry all the gear, cannot distribute the load.  You do all the camp chores.  No one to motivate you when you dawdle.  No one to talk to or discuss a change in plans.  Can be lonely in the evening.",comment_3,r/WildernessBackpacking,Travel,,https://www.reddit.com/r/WildernessBackpacking/comments/1kra0y1/first_time_solo_trip_adivce/
"Obviously you need water bottles and a water sanitation arrangement.  I prefer Sawyer filters, but there are other filters out there.  Or you can use iodide tablets for a short trip.  Good to bring a few in case your filter fails, but they hurt the taste of the water for me.  I don't think you need a toiletries kit.  A plastic toothbrush doesn't weigh much.  Get a travel-size tube of toothpaste and a half-used bar of soap and you're all set.  If it's just one night, you could skip the soap really.  A little hand sanitizer could be an alternative.  Remember a bit of toilet paper, and be sure to bury it along with whatever comes out.  You could bring a little plastic trowel, but I just use an appropriately shaped rock to dig a hole so that the top of what you bury is at least a foot underground after you fill it back up with the dirt you dug out.  In the Catskills you will need a way to protect your stuff (including toiletries) from bears. Either a bear bag or a canister.  The canister is heavier but more fool proof.

You could skip the stove and fuel, especially for just one overnight.  Just bring food that doesn't need cooking.  Unless, like me, you need coffee.  Then the stove and fuel are essential.

Most of my wilderness backpacking has been solo.  I prefer it.  Embrace the solitude.  You will be closer to nature.  It's a spiritual experience.",comment_4,r/WildernessBackpacking,Travel,,https://www.reddit.com/r/WildernessBackpacking/comments/1kra0y1/first_time_solo_trip_adivce/

"Not necessarily because there's just tons of bears there to begin with. Additionally, the glacier bears, seemingly are more ""scared"" than say Yellowstone/Tetons area. They almost always just run off. By this point in the year too - berries are basically eradicated. So even though they're in their hyperphagia mode - you could argue you actually see less than say Aug-Mid Sept. when they're just constantly gorging on the top tier food items which often keeps them visible on hillsides/trails etc. 

The one thing with Oct. though - a tremendous reduction in people. So you may also get lucky and see more in a singular day on a singular route type of thing because there may literally be no people on a 10-20 section mile of trail for 1-2 days. 

Like all wild animals though. You can't predict em ya know. It's a luck of the draw in what ya get vs what ya don't get.

Don't get me wrong. Every place you can backpack, has it's OPTIMAL time to be there. For Glacier. That's unquestionably, August. However, early Oct. In the NW has been stunning for yearsssss of late. Like a decade straight. So you get fall colors. 90% people reduction. Cooler temps to trek in. I mean hard to be upset with that. 

Glacier is already naturally SUPER colorful though - so being there at it's most lush time in August - I mean that is apex Glacier. But it could easily be smoked out for the majority of the month.

"I do a lot of commercial freeze dried meals, and switched from a pot to a tea kettle (GSI Halulite) because of it. It's so much easier to pour from a kettle than a pot! So, so, sooo much easier. And I also wanted to branch out to cooking more meals, so I added two more pot things that all stack together:

Inside the kettle I keep my stove (Pocket Rocket 2), 3.9 oz fuel can, fuel can stand, 2 folding spoons, lighter and piezo, a handkerchief for drying/wiping/whatever, and some tea/cider packets. I then nest the kettle into a Sea to Summit collapsible bowl/plate/thing, which then gets nested inside an aluminum Teflon pot/skillet thing from some long lost brand. 

It's a very neat and tidy, and super flexible, package. If I don't need the collapsible bowl and pot/skillet, I use them to hold garbage and small things while I'm cooking, so it all stays together and off the ground. One of my spoons is long and kinda flimsy and the other is shorter and much stronger, each one is used for different tasks and meals.

All together, with a full can of fuel, it weighs 2 pounds. I know I could cut weight if I'm not planning to use a bowl or pot, but there's peace of mind keeping it all together and knowing I have the same gear every time.

"[request] Campsite selection: how to identify cold sinks? I’d like to improve my campsite selection process, but there are two competing truths about the outdoors which seem contradictory, so I’m asking for help understanding the nuance.

Truth 1: temperature drops with elevation.  For each 1000’ of elevation, temperature can change as much as 5*F.  Conclusion: to be warmer, go lower.

Truth 2: cold air sinks and collects at lower elevations.  Conclusion: don’t sleep in valleys?

Rule of thumb only about elevation:  You lose 3.5 degrees for every 1000’ feet higher. Conditions can vary that quite a lot. So setting up 15 or 20 feet below ridge top really won’t make a whole bunch of difference other than finding a sheltered place if it’s windy.

If it's a full forest then you will be fine, because trees are fine being there.",comment_5,r/WildernessBackpacking,Travel,,https://www.reddit.com/r/WildernessBackpacking/comments/1kpskof/request_campsite_selection_how_to_identify_cold/
"Eja 58L or 48L Hello!

I live in Australia, and I am looking at getting either the Eja 58L or the 48L in the dark teal colour (this is important). 

I currently use a Gregory Jade 38 and have made it work for 3-day thru-hiking/camping trips. I really like this backpack, but it is noticeably tight to pack. I recently got a 2-p tent to accommodate my husband, and that kind of killed the 38 for me. I made it work, but it was awful.  

My gut instinct was to get the 58 as the grammage was not that much different, but the teal colour is not available in Australia. I would have to order it from REI and have it forwarded to Aus for an additional 50 AUD on top of it being already more expensive. Yes, I despise that purple colour that much. I am still leaning this way, but am also considering the 48L too. 

The 48L in teal is readily available nearby. 

I want to use this pack for all season camping, including the AT at some point in the future. 

What do you think? Is it worth the hassle for the extra 10 L? My gut says yes, but I am not sure.",post,r/WildernessBackpacking,Travel,2.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/WildernessBackpacking/comments/1kq6iez/eja_58l_or_48l/
"Keep in mind that the torso size affects capacity. The Eja 58 in XS/S is actually 55L. 

I’m in the US, but I have an unused teal 58L in M/L I’ve been meaning to post on r/geartrade if you’re interested. It’s a really nice pack, but I couldn’t get a good fit on the shoulder straps and the hip fins were a bit too short for me.",comment_1,r/WildernessBackpacking,Travel,,https://www.reddit.com/r/WildernessBackpacking/comments/1kq6iez/eja_58l_or_48l/
"up to you if you want to pay extra for a color!

I would get the 58 but in a different color. Guess it depends on your gear but 48 is on the small side imo,comment_3,r/WildernessBackpacking,Travel,,https://www.reddit.com/r/WildernessBackpacking/comments/1kq6iez/eja_58l_or_48l/
"If you already make a 38 work, but need a bit of extra space, I imagine the 48 would be perfect. Even if your 2P tent is like 6 pounds, it probably doesn't take up 10L when compressed.",comment_4,r/WildernessBackpacking,Travel,,https://www.reddit.com/r/WildernessBackpacking/comments/1kq6iez/eja_58l_or_48l/
"I generally have not regretted extra 10-20L of volume within the same pack line (in my case HMG Southwest), due to the added versatility and making lacking really easy. The time I specifically dislike it is when I want a narrower pack (for scrambling), but that requires an entirely different model.",comment_5,r/WildernessBackpacking,Travel,,https://www.reddit.com/r/WildernessBackpacking/comments/1kq6iez/eja_58l_or_48l/
"Camera recs? Just popping in here to ask: what camera are y’all using for backpacking trips? 

Some background- I do basic landscape photography as a hobby. Nothing too crazy but I want a camera that goes beyond my iphone 11 for capturing my trips. I previously used a Canon G7X ii for some trips and I absolutely loved all its capabilities, and got some great shots with it, but it fell short on durability. I sadly wrecked it after my last trip to the Rockies…so now I’m on the hunt for a replacement. 

So with that said: anyone here into photography & videography that can recommend a good but durable camera setup for treks? I’m looking for something relatively light (though obviously I understand weight is a sacrifice when it comes to camera equipment) that can take nice pics, to include low light photos. I do already own a GoPro and a Canon DSLR but neither really seem to hit that “sweet spot” for what I’m looking for- basically high quality with flexible settings but also portable. The GoPro is cool for some stuff but quality is a bit meh for photos, and the DSLR is just way too heavy to be practical. Ofc I’m always looking for something budget friendly but I’m open to buying something nice if it’s going to last a long time.

TIA for your advice!",post,r/WildernessBackpacking,Travel,0.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/WildernessBackpacking/comments/1kq7qqz/camera_recs/
"Sony RX100 VII.  Much better lens and sensor than a cell phone, and has all of the settings options someone serious about photography will care about, without the size and bulk of a camera with interchangeable lenses.

The Sony Alpha series are a good choice if you do want interchangeable lenses and even better sensors, and are willing to deal with some bulk and weight.  The RX100 is pocketable though.

This is a good review of a slightly older build of the RX100, specifically from the perspective of using it for outdoor adventures [https://www.colinhendersonphoto.com/gear-review/sony-rx100-compact-camera](https://www.colinhendersonphoto.com/gear-review/sony-rx100-compact-camera)",comment_1,r/WildernessBackpacking,Travel,,https://www.reddit.com/r/WildernessBackpacking/comments/1kq7qqz/camera_recs/

"Kodak PIXPRO AZ421. It's pretty bulky as far as cameras go but it's a price I willingly pay for built in 42x optical zoom. Pretty sure they run under $250 these days. It looks like, if the info on Amazon is true, it weighs the same as the Canon G7X ii at 1 lb. The grip you have on it is much better since you have to cup your hand into a C around the part that sticks out the front of the camera so less likely to drop it when handling. 

Honestly though it's the only non disposable digital camera I've ever bought and it was the optical zoom I was mainly looking for to take pictures of things in the distance.",comment_5,r/WildernessBackpacking,Travel,,https://www.reddit.com/r/WildernessBackpacking/comments/1kq7qqz/camera_recs/

Ran phantom 3oz. Probably the lightest rain jacket you can find. Packs smaller than your fist.

"First time backpacking, seeking recommendations for Ozark trail vs Isle Royale Hello all,

I'm planning a camping/backpacking trip in a couple weeks (June 1-11) and am trying to decide between the Ozark trail and Isle Royale (I'm based in Chicago so they're sorta equidistant). I would only be backpacking for a couple days, and car camping the rest of the trip. I have a good amount of experience camping, and want to get into backpacking. I already have a proper backpack for it, and a good amount of gear for regular camping. I have a limited budget for new gear but will almost certainly have to get a stove and water filtration system.

I'm looking for people who have been to one or both of these places and could share experiences and/or recommendations especially to a first-time backpacker.",post,r/WildernessBackpacking,Travel,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/WildernessBackpacking/comments/1kppi6e/first_time_backpacking_seeking_recommendations/

"Isle royale twice here. I highly reccomend the seaplane as opposed to the boat (saves you about 10 hours of travel time, and it's awesome.) Isle royale is very rugged hiking at times, ive been to glacier and grand canyon multiple times and can say even without the elevation the Isle is rugged and demanding.  Early June will be less bugs but I generally don't go that far north until late August as a native michigander. The black flies and mosquitoes are a real thing in early summer there. The Isle is an awesome experience for its remotness and isolation and always a worthy trip. There's a reason it's one of the least visited and most revisited national parks. Ive been backcountry in alot of places and I'll always go back to the island any chance I get, its truly a unique experience that I really enjoy. No bears, no ticks, no poison ivy. The wolves are becoming a thing which is awesome in my mind, last trip there I heard them calling over the bay and it was truly brilliant.",comment_4,r/WildernessBackpacking,Travel,,https://www.reddit.com/r/WildernessBackpacking/comments/1kppi6e/first_time_backpacking_seeking_recommendations/

"Yeah that’s a great loop! Have done it twice, once two months ago and once last year. Yes you have the two scorpion campgrounds down there right by the cliff dwellings. Trail wise, it’s awesome! My favorite part definitely like most I’d assume was getting into the actual middle fork. That section from when you drop down all the way to the Little Bear Canyon is pretty incredible. Great camps too where the trail drops down into the middle fork, by the hot springs and then again by Little Bear Canyon where you pop out if going clockwise. Did it in 3 days, 2 nights. Felt like plenty of time. Just know it can get a little hot on the ascent going from the west fork to middle fork but if you camp by the river once you drop down to the middle fork you’ll be golden. Lastly definitely worth soaking in Jordan Hot springs too! Enjoy!",comment_5,r/WildernessBackpacking,Travel,,https://i.redd.it/i65hscdg4f1f1.jpeg

"Yes, it can be. We use poison ivy wipes if we don’t have access to a stream or something before hitting camp. I teach my dogs to walk on trail and keep them on a lead most times for their safety. If you are going to an area that allows off-lead dogs, make sure your recall is as strong as it can be. Any dog will drop to instinct given the right circumstances, but trust in you and strong recall helps to curb those impulses as they mature.
