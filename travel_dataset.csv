"For anyone interested in riding the entire Shimanami Kaido AND going to Rabbit Island in one day We wanted to cycle the whole route (Onomichi to Imabari) and go to Rabbit Island. I haven‚Äôt seen many Reddit posts with people doing this so thought I‚Äôd share our experience. 

We were staying in Hiroshima, so we took the 6:20 Shinkansen which got into Onomichi at 6:51. The station is small so we got out quickly and hopped straight in a taxi that was waiting outside the station. We arrived at the [bike terminal] (https://maps.app.goo.gl/YePnf7ASmreZwuCE7?g_st=com.google.maps.preview.copy) by about 7AM and there were already a few people ahead of us. We didn‚Äôt book bikes because the weather was looking a bit hit and miss and we knew we didn‚Äôt want to cycle in the rain. My advice would be to absolutely [book bikes] (https://shimanami-cycle.or.jp/go-shimanami/experience/447/) if you want any kind of electric bike. They were all out of the e-assist bikes but luckily had a few e-bikes left so we were able to get those. They have tonnes of cross bikes so if you‚Äôre not fussed getting an electric one you should be fine to just turn up. A note here - we are both experienced cyclists. My partner is a club cyclist and I am a commuter cyclist. Before the ride we both thought the ~70km would be pretty easy for us to do on regular cross bikes, but ended up deciding to get e-bikes because we wanted to do rabbit island too. On reflection, it would have been too ambitious for us to do the whole ride on push bikes, and have enough time to do rabbit island. As mentioned before, there are some pretty steep inclines to get on to the bridges which I hadn‚Äôt anticipated would be quite so long. 

It took us about 6 hours to get from Onomichi to Imabari. We weren‚Äôt cycling flat out, and we had our e-bikes on the lowest setting for most of the ride to preserve battery (with the exception being to go up those aforementioned inclines!). We had lots of stops along the way, there are tonnes of toilets and vending machines which we frequently stopped at. We also stopped for 45 minutes or so for lunch. 

We arrived at Imabari at around 2pm, had a quick bite to eat and then got in a taxi to go to Sakari Port on ≈åmishima Island. We couldn‚Äôt find another way to get there so concluded a taxi was our only way. You might be able to stop along the way and catch the ferry over to the island, but we weren‚Äôt sure if we could take bikes with us on the ferry and were worried if we did this we would miss the last time to drop off our bikes at Imabari. The taxi was expensive‚Ä¶ but I wanted to see the bunnies so I was ready to pay lol. The taxi was approx ¬•12,000 which included the tolls. Once we got to the port at Sakari we had to wait a while for the ferry. I believe they run every hour or so. We missed one by about 20 minutes so we had a 50 minute wait.

We were able to buy a ticket to rabbit island, and then another ticket to take the ferry onward to the mainland (to Tadanoumi) from rabbit island. The ferry was ¬•360 per trip.

After about an hour on Rabbit Island we caught the ferry to Tadanoumi port. From here we took a JR train to Takehara and then caught an expressway bus on to Hiroshima for ¬•1400. We caught the final bus of the day to Hiroshima at 18:16 so just be aware of this as a hard cut off. The bus was a surprise highlight for us! It was peaceful (in the UK we‚Äôd call it a ‚Äúcoach‚Äù rather than a bus) and winds its way through the hills back to Hiroshima.

It was a very long day - we left our hotel in Hiroshima at 5:45 and didn‚Äôt get back until 19:45 and we spent quite a bit of money with all the different types of public transport, plus e-bikes, but it was totally worth it. Just putting this post out there in case anyone is also planning a trip like I was and wanting to work out if they can do the whole ride and see the bunnies :)

I'm interested in riding the shimanami kaido in October but not sure how I'll incorporate into my visit. Is it remotely feasible to make this a very long day trip from Osaka with shinkansen? I might consider adding an overnight stay in fukuyama to do this ride and see Hiroshima.,comment_2,r/JapanTravel,Comedy,,https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/1ktg122/for_anyone_interested_in_riding_the_entire/

"Hita Kyushu trip report I'm writing this post today because I didn't find many trip reports about Hita on this subreddit.

We spent 25 days in Japan as part of a longer 5-month journey. We really enjoyed Kyushu. In particular, we loved our night in Yufuin at a Ryokan with an onsen. After visiting Beppu, we wanted to return to a quiet mountain town and enjoy one last Ryokan experience before our flight out of Fukuoka.

Geographically, it made sense to stop in Hita, as the city is about halfway between Beppu and Fukuoka via the limited express train.

First, I should mention that we're not AOT (Attack on Titan) fans. We didn‚Äôt find much information online, except that some people refer to Hita as the ""Little Kyoto of Kyushu.""

We booked a night at a Ryokan located in the main tourist area (near Mamedamachi Shopping Street). I won‚Äôt advertise the name here, but it was a great experience : spotless room, traditional ambiance, and a nice onsen.

The neighborhood is very charming, dotted with traditional houses and small, quiet temples. There's a very peaceful atmosphere, and the river running alongside it adds to the charm. Even if you‚Äôre not into AOT, there are still a few things to see (Japanese doll museum, sake brewery). It‚Äôs enough to fill a day. There are also enough caf√©s and lunch spots. Overall, the day went by quickly, it was very relaxing to stroll around Hita. We saw very few Western tourists; most of the visitors were Korean.

In the evening, we mainly enjoyed our time at the Ryokan. We had dinner outside. There are far fewer restaurants open at night, and the area becomes very quiet, with not much in the way of nightlife or open shops.

Is Hita worth visiting? Yes, for its old district and peaceful vibe. Is it worth staying overnight? Yes, if you have accommodation that you truly enjoy spending time in; otherwise, the town might feel a bit too quiet after 6 pm. We probably preferred Yufuin because the scenery there is more striking, but we definitely don‚Äôt regret our stop in Hita : it allowed us to spend more time enjoying the mountains of Kyushu.

Travel safe in Japan!",post,r/JapanTravel,Comedy,5.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/1kt7jdu/hita_kyushu_trip_report/
"Cool! I‚Äôm heading there myself this November. Just out of curiosity, did you visit Onta pottery village nearby, or do any shopping for Onta ware in Hita? I‚Äôm in two minds about visiting Onta, because I‚Äôm a huge fan of ceramics, but I don‚Äôt drive, and buses there and back seem very infrequent.",comment_1,r/JapanTravel,Comedy,,https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/1kt7jdu/hita_kyushu_trip_report/
"I wouldn‚Äôt go as far as to say it‚Äôs worth taking a 4-hour train ride just for Hita. However, if you‚Äôre already in the area and the weather is nice, it could be worth stopping by on the way, or even spending a night there if you enjoy quieter and more peaceful places. The two restaurants we went to were very local and incredibly cheap.",comment_2,r/JapanTravel,Comedy,,https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/1kt7jdu/hita_kyushu_trip_report/
"That's really cool. Sounds like a great trip! Getting off the western tourist path is very rewarding!

I stayed near Hita just over a year ago, but didn't make it there. So it's worth a visit, if I was to return to the area? Thinking of going back next year.",comment_3,r/JapanTravel,Comedy,,https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/1kt7jdu/hita_kyushu_trip_report/
"Sorry, I didn‚Äôt go there, my stay was very short. However, I did pass by the bus station and it seemed quite well connected, with buses going in many directions regularly. I hope you‚Äôll find what you‚Äôre looking for once you‚Äôre there.",comment_4,r/JapanTravel,Comedy,,https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/1kt7jdu/hita_kyushu_trip_report/

"Transport from Narita to Disney Resort Hi everyone!

"2 weeks in Japan So, I traveled to Japan from 27th April to 11th May. Here are highlights of my trip:

*Aomori, Hirosaki, Hakodate, Osaka, Nara, Hiroshima, Miyajima, Kyoto, Tokyo, Kawaguchiko*

27th - landed in Tokyo and took a Shinkansen to Aomori. Checked into hotel and went straight to bed. 

28th - woke up early in the morning and took a train to Hirosaki to attend cherry blossom festival at Hirosaki park. Visited the castle, saw mount iwaki, visited botanical garden, stayed till sunset to watch Sakura trees in the nighttime when they light up the whole park, came back to Aomori

29th - woke up early in the morning, took a Shinkansen to Hakodate. It was raining in Hakodate, visited Goryokaku park, saw more Sakura trees. Shopped at the famous red brick warehouses 

30th - took a flight from Aomori to Osaka. Forwarded luggage to our hotel and headed straight to Nara. Visited Todai ji and the deer park. Came back to Osaka city, had food. Checked into hotel, our luggage had already arrived. Freshened up and went out to Dotonbori area. 

1st - went to Osaka castle. Took a cruise. Chilled a bit. Easy day

2nd - checked out of hotel, locked luggage at the lockers on Osaka station. Took a train to Hiroshima. Visited the peace museum and the a bomb dome. Took a ferry to Miyajima and visited Shinto shrine and the floating tori gate. Headed back to Osaka through Hiroshima. Took out luggage from Osaka station and headed to Kyoto. Checked at hotel in Kyoto pretty late in the night 

3rd - woke up early in the morning and took a walking tour of Kyoto. Visited temples, shrines, pagodas, geisha district, bridges as a part of walking tour. Went to samurai museum (worst possible activity ever) and then ended the day with some Mexican food and sake. 

4th - went to Fushimi inari, Kinkaku-ji, nijo castle, bamboo forest, kinda hectic day. Clocked 30k steps

5th - woke up, checked out of hotel and took a Shinkansen to Tokyo. Thought of stopping at hakone to view Mount Fuji, but it was a cloudy day so went straight to Tokyo. Checked into hotel and explored Akhihabara. 

6th - it rained the whole day so had to find some indoor activities. Headed to Ginza. Shopped at itoya, Muji, Uniqlo and a couple of other shops. 

7th - sunny day. Went to Meiji shrine and the park around it. Checked out few more shops in HARAJUKU area. 

8th - woke up and took a bus to kawaguchiko station. Visited Kawaguchiko lake, took the rope way, but still couldn‚Äôt spot Fuji because of clouds. Went to another spot, Saiko, that‚Äôs when the clouds started clearing up and we saw top of Fuji. Visited caves, Oishi park etc. and impromptu decided to stay there. Booked an Airbnb and checked into it. Went out in evening to see Fuji more clear. Clicked lot of pictures 

9th - went to Motosuko area. Visited the park where they were celebrating shibazakura festival. Just before leaving, spotted Fuji again. Took a bus back to Tokyo. Visited skytree, had dinner and retired for the night. 

10th - last minute shopping at harajuku, akhihabara, asakusabashi, Shibuya.

11th - packed bags and headed to airport for our flight. Spotted Fuji again from the flight. 

Cherry Blossoms, Iwaki, Fuji, Shinkansen rides, Tori gates, Hiroshima, were the highlights of my trip.",post,r/JapanTravel,Comedy,24.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/1ksqgfg/2_weeks_in_japan/

"Help me choose - Kanazawa vs Old Nakaserdo Trail I will be visiting Japan for the first time this summer on a solo three week trip. I caught a bad case of mission creep and am now trying to remove locations / activities in order to better enjoy my time in the country. One thing that was removed was an overnight stay in Magome, and then hiking the Old Nakaserdo Trail to Nagiso followed by a train to Tokyo. I may be able to salvage this, but that would require skipping Kanazawa. Would the community be able to share their thoughts and recommendations? It really comes down to seeing the garden firefly event at night vs hiking a historical trail

Of note: I will have spent 2 nights in Miyajima, 5 nights in Kyoto, and 3 nights in Hokkaido prior to this (2 nights in Lake Koya and 1 night in Sapporo); After the below, I will be hiking Mt Fuji, spending 2 nights in Hakone, and 3 nights in Tokyo (one full day in Tokyo will be a day trip Nagoya for a Sumo tournament)

**Original Itinerary**

* **Day 11 - Afternoon flight from Sapporo to Kanazawa**
   * Firefly event at Kenroku-en
* **Day 12 - Kanazawa**
   * Explore more gardens
   * Visit the Samurai and geisha districts
   * Possibly the ninja temple and museum
* **Day 13 - Kanazawa to Takayama**
   * Bus (3ish hours) from Kanazawa to Takyama
   * Vist the Hida na sato
   * Historic district for sake
* **Day 14 - Takayama to Tokyo**
   * Morning market
   * Explore the historic district
   * \~5ish hour commute to Tokyo... (I was originally going take a 5 hour journey to Magome, spend the night, and then hike / go to Tokyo the following day)

**Alternative Itinerary**

* **Day 11** **- Late afternoon flight from Sapporo to Nagoya**
   * This would be more expensive than my current flight to Kanazawa and I would have to pay \~$50 in ANA cancellation fees
* **Day 12 - Nagoya** (I cannot combine this idea with the Sumo tournament due to my travel dates)
   * Day trip to Magome / Nagiso - Early morning train + bus to Magome, hike 4 hours, train back from Nagiso
* **Day 13 - Nagoya to Takayama**
   * Early morning train to Takayama (the commute time is similiar to that from Kanazawa
   * Visit Hida na Sato
   * Historic district for Sake
* **Day 14 - Takayama to Tokyo**
   * Morning market
   * Explore the historic district
   * \~5 hour commute from Tokyo",post,r/JapanTravel,Comedy,3.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/1kt0epz/help_me_choose_kanazawa_vs_old_nakaserdo_trail/
"I am currently in Tokyo, just got here after doing the Nakasendo on foot, from Nakatsugawa to Magome, Magome to Tsumago, Tsumago to Nagiso. 

I loved it. The hikes are great. The scenery is beautiful. Magome is the nicest town. I stayed there overnight, and it's a place I'll always remember. 

If you don't like hiking and are intending to take the bus, maybe it's not worth it. But the waterfalls along the way, the forests, the tea houses on the trail, the gardens, to me, made it an amazing couple of days. 

Tsumago is nice too, but much more modern than Magome. Nagiso is completely shippable.",comment_1,r/JapanTravel,Comedy,,https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/1kt0epz/help_me_choose_kanazawa_vs_old_nakaserdo_trail/

there are a lot gardens in kyoto and in japan if you think about it

"It does! I think I found a solution that lets me do everything while making nobody happy. On the way back from Takayama to Tokyo, I could take the bus to Kanazawa, arrive around 2, 3pmish, and spend 2 hours at Kenroku-en, and then take the train to Tokyo. This obviously depends on the weather, how much energy I have, etc, but would let me at least see the garden.

"the garden in Kanazawa is surely worth a visit. if you like fish/sushi, the market there is amazing. the city itself is pretty cute, and the people are, for a lack of a better word, very warm.  
visiting the ""old japan"" districts can be a bit of a let down. I mean, they are nice, but dont expect too much.

if you have been to kyoto, you may feel a bit like ""having seen it before"".

spending one or two nights there is certainly not a mistake, but if you have something else that you much rather do, I dont think you would miss something that you would regret for the rest of your life.",comment_5,r/JapanTravel,Comedy,,https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/1kt0epz/help_me_choose_kanazawa_vs_old_nakaserdo_trail/

"Overall looks fine. Depends on what you mean by seeing Mt Fuji. You will see it when catching the Shinkansen from Tokyo to Kyoto (and then when going back to Tokyo). For some that may be enough.

Another option is a day trip from Tokyo to Kawaguchiko. If you wanted to you could condense days 2-5 into 3 days which would give you a free day to do this.

Another popular option is an overnight at Hakone but that would need a bit more reshuffling of itinerary.",comment_3,r/JapanTravel,Comedy,,https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/1kt8zlw/should_i_save_mount_fuji_for_another_trip_would/
"An Alternative is to stay near Akakusa¬†(We stayed at Asakusa View Hotel Annex Rokku) which was very well located.  The area had a great night time vibe and not as crowded as some other places.  There is a direct train from the airport called ""Keisei Sky Access""

There is a Yamato Transport in the area that you can use to forward your luggage to your next hotel

Tokyo National Museum is tricky if you do not read Japanese (well it was when I went).  I really want to see Yayoi Kusama Museum and Sumida Hokusai Museum both of which could be of interest.

Nishiki Market¬†is very commercial.  The Pontocho Alley street next door is full of restaurants including some fancy traditional places.

Some temples will be so packed it is hard to move, some others are near empty. We left Arashiyama out of stress  and went to Ryoanji , if we had gone earlier, I could have had lunch again at Seigeiin on the grounds.

I agree with other commenters.  Just look out the train window on the right hand side about 40 minutes after leaving Tokyo station.  It is usually visible for a good 5 minutes depending on the weather.",comment_4,r/JapanTravel,Comedy,,https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/1kt8zlw/should_i_save_mount_fuji_for_another_trip_would/

"Trip Report - 18 days between Osaka and Tokyo This is a report of my third trip to Japan, with a return to Osaka after two years, as well as various day trips from Tokyo and a whole bunch of events around Golden Week.



**Day 1 - April 21: Arrival.**

Flight to Japan, landed in Osaka on 21st of April in the early evening. Took a moment to get my bearings, swap out my simcard, get some Yen from the 7-11 ATM and travel to my hostel in Osaka for some much needed sleep.

¬†

**Day 2 - April 22: Kyoto**

Got some breakfast followed by a trip to Kyoto, picking up my 14 day JR pass at Kyoto station to be active from the next day.

After that was a trip to Arashiyama Bamboo Forest, followed by a walk from there to Arashiyama park for the Ho-oh manhole cover. A trio of local ladies with the same idea even helped with taking pictures!

Next was a relaxing walk alongside the Katsura river to Nishikyogoku, followed be a trip to the other side of Kyoto for the Ryozen Museum of History. A museum well worth visiting! The day was finished by a return to Osaka for dinner and a bar event hosted by a local idol.

¬†

**Day 3 - April 23: Hiroshima**

A journey to Hiroshima for a visit to Shukkeien Garden, the ruins of Hiroshima Castle, and the Peace Memorial Park with associated museums. The evening was filled by the return to Osaka and a birthday event for a member of a local idol group.

¬†

**Day 4 - April 24: Journey to Tokyo**

A busy day filled by a trip to the Hanazono Rugby Stadium (and Raikou manhole cover), travel to Tokyo by shinkansen, checking in at the hotel in Nishi-kasai, and a quick trip to Shinkiba for the 3rd anniversary show of Prominence (Getting to meet Sera Risa and Kasai Jun was super cool!)

¬†

**Day 5 - April 25: Aizuwakamatsu**

Woke up early for the journey to Aizuwakamatsu, with a lot of lovely scenery on the way there! Over there I visited the gravesite of the Byakkotai, the Sazaedo Temple, Tsuruga Castle, and had a great Katsudon for lunch. The evening was spent by heading back to Tokyo and watching a stageplay at a theater in Shibuya.

¬†

**Day 6 - April 26: Yokohama day 1.**

The morning was spent on some shopping, before heading over to Shin-Yokohama for a day of concerts!

¬†

**Day 7 - April 27: Yokohama day 2.**

The second day in a row that I ended up spending at the Yokohama Arena complex, this time for a wrestling show that ended up effectively eating the entire day. Stardom's All Star Grand Queendom ended up being absolutely worth it though!

¬†

**Day 8 - April 28: Rest day (Kind of).**

Between relaxing, figuring some things out for the next few days, and a small trip to Nagoya and back, this day flew by.

¬†

**Day 9 - April 29: Idol events.**

The day opened with an idol event in Minato City. This was followed by another idol event in Shibuya, where I met many of my Japanese friends again and it felt as if I had last seen them the day before rather than a year earlier. The day ended with another idol's birthday event in Ikebukuro.

¬†

**Day 10 - April 30: Dinosaurs in Fukui.**

Woke up early for the day trip to Fukui for the Fukui Prefectural Dinosaur museum! Absolutely fantastic views on the way there, both in the shinkansen from Tokyo and the local train from Fukui to Katsuyama. The Dinosaur museum alone already made it well worth the effort of visiting, but the various Dinosaur animatronics and images around Fukui station were also cool to see! After a visit to the ruins of Fukui Castle it was time to head back to Tokyo.

¬†

**Day 11 - May 1: No real plans.**

The eleventh day was spent on a visit to Gotokuji Temple, some shop browsing and a last minute decision to go to a wrestling show at Korakuen Hall.

¬†

**Day 12 - May 2: Rest and planning.**

The usual breakfast, followed by double-checking the time and financial planning for the next few days. The rest of the day was spent shopping for things like specific Pok√©mon cards at Akihabara, as well as an idol event in the evening.

¬†

**Day 13 - May 3: Harajuku-Kasukabe-Harajuku.**

The start of a super busy few days! First a trip to Harajuku for the merch pre-sale of an anniversary concert, followed by a journey to Kasukabe for a wrestling show, in turn followed by a race back to Harajuku to catch the earlier mentioned anniversary concert! After the concert I ended up having dinner with my Japanese friends, which concluded the day.

¬†

**Day 14 - May 4: Kabukicho and Ikebukuro.**

Went to an idol festival in Kabukicho with my friends, where through some miracle I managed to see and meet everyone I wanted to see and/or meet. This was followed by an event in Ikebukuro where five bands would be performing, and contrary to expectations I managed to catch all five of them! Overall an excellent day, especially as I met a bunch of new people!

¬†

**Day 15 - May 5: Osaka!**

Another early wake up, this time for a trip to Osaka for an idol event and a wrestling show. After the show and associated merch sales and meet and greets there was time for some dinner before heading back to Tokyo. ¬†



**Day 16 - May 6: The last event.**

Went to Ueno and met up with my friends yet again for an idol's graduation concert, which between the merch pre-sale, the show itself, and the drinking at an izakaya afterwards ate up the entire day.

¬†

**Day 17 - May 7: The last day.**

The last full day of the trip, I ended up waking up late and spent the day between last minute shopping in Akihabara, relaxing in Ueno park, and repacking my bags for the journey home.

¬†

**Day 18 - May 8: Flight home.**

Woke up really early, checked out of the hotel, went to Haneda airport by bus and flew home.



**Final thoughts:**

My third trip to Japan ended up being a lot of fun, and the people I met everywhere were just as kind as the previous two trips. Ultimately one of the few ways this trip could have been better, was if I had had a better grasp of the Japanese language. 

Admittedly getting a JR pass for this trip was a bit of a gamble, as I wasn't sure if I'd be able to pull off all of the planned day trips I wanted to do. In the end it worked out perfectly though. 

Another thing that ended up working out perfectly was the travel during Golden Week; contrary to my expectations fed by people's comments, travel during Golden Week ended up being no problem whatsoever. It wasn't all that busy by my standards, though I may have been helped by travelling alone, early, and without luggage.

Perhaps most importantly, I managed to fulfill last year's promise of meeting my Japanese friends again! (Even if I did end up promising it again while we were drinking at an izakaya.) 

Between the photos, the various polaroids, and my daily updated travel logbook of this and the previous trips, I will not forget this trip anytime soon!",post,r/JapanTravel,Comedy,8.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/1ksrqcm/trip_report_18_days_between_osaka_and_tokyo/
"I'll limit it to a few points:

¬†Weather overall was excellent this year, mostly cloudy or even sunny with temperatures generally between 15-20 degrees Celsius. I do recall three days with (some) rain while I was in Tokyo, but that does come with the side note that I might have missed other moments of bad weather due to travelling to a different part of the country.

¬†

When it comes to crowds things were never all that terrible, though I might have missed obvious busy spots and times as a result of my activities.

¬†

Regarding visiting museums, events and such, I'd strongly recommend at least having an idea of what you want to visit roughly on what day, and figuring out what options you have to secure tickets beforehand. Obviously events and concerts generally require a lot more planning than a museum visit. (Depending on the museum in question, of course! The Nintendo museum is bound to be more busy than the Ryozen museum for example.)

¬†

I planned to be in Tokyo for the Golden Week portion of this trip on purpose, knowing that there would be plenty of events to choose from just about every day for that period. Any other moments could easily be filled in by other activities. This method is of course not necessarily suitable for everyone.",comment_1,r/JapanTravel,Comedy,,https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/1ksrqcm/trip_report_18_days_between_osaka_and_tokyo/

Just my two cents, I would cut Hiroshima/Hakone/Himeji and swap it with Nagasaki and do day trips from Fukuoka.

"3rd trip to Japan: itinerary between Osaka-Ise-Nagoya-Atami-Tokyo Hi everyone!

My husband and I are planning our 3rd trip to Japan. During our first visit in May 2023, we did the classic Tokyo-Kyoto-Osaka-Nara route, and also took day trips to Yokohama, Kamakura and Enoshima Island. For our second trip in November 2024, we explored Tokyo, Kawagoe, Fujikawaguchiko, Kanazawa, Takayama, Shirakawa-go, Hiroshima (including Miyajima), Okayama and Kurashiki.

This time, we‚Äôll only have two weeks in Japan (compared to three weeks for the previous ones), and are currently considering the following itinerary:

* Osaka (11-14 December)
   * We‚Äôre planning to revisit some of the spots we really enjoyed the first time around: Hozenji Yokocho, Namba Yasaka Shrine, D≈çtonbori, Hozen-ji Temple, and probably do a bit of shopping. It'll be quite a relaxed few days.
* Ise (14-16 December)
   * We‚Äôve scheduled two days in Ise to visit Ise Jing≈´, Okage Yokocho, Futami Okitama Shrine and the Meoto Iwa rocks. It‚Äôll be our first time in the area, so if anyone has any recommendations, we‚Äôd love to hear them!
* Nagoya (16-18 December)
   * We initially thought of going to Gifu, but it seemed like there wasn‚Äôt too much to do, so we‚Äôve opted for Nagoya instead. That said, we‚Äôre not entirely sure about this choice, as we‚Äôve heard it may not be the most exciting city for tourists. 
   * We plan to spend two days there and visit K≈çsh≈ç-ji, Atsuta Jing≈´, Sakae, Osu Shotengai Shopping Street, and possibly take a short trip to Inuyama Castle in the afternoon.
* Atami (18-21 December)
   * We‚Äôve heard it‚Äôs a charming little seaside town with good access to onsens and a nice introduction to the Izu Peninsula. We plan to spend 3 days in the area:
      * 1 day to relax and explore Atami itself (Itokawa Promenade, Kinomiya Shrine, Kiunkaku), and hopefully find a private onsen where we can unwind (my husband has large tattoos, so any onsen suggestions would be very welcome!);
      * 1 day trip to It≈ç and the Jogasaki Coast;
      * 1 day trip to Hakone, which we‚Äôve never visited before. We‚Äôre a bit hesitant though, as we found Fujikawaguchiko quite crowded and worry Hakone might be similar.
* Tokyo (21-26 December)
   * We‚Äôll finish our trip with five days in Tokyo, mainly for shopping, food tours, relaxing in caf√©s, and soaking up the city atmosphere.
   * Something we haven‚Äôt really done during our previous trips - mostly because we were too tired in the evenings - is go to jazz bars or places with live music. We‚Äôd really love to experience that this time, so if you know of any good spots in any of the cities we‚Äôll be visiting, we‚Äôd love to hear your recommendations!

We‚Äôve tried to keep this itinerary practical, as we‚Äôre not light travellers (we each have a large suitcase), and prefer travelling by train rather than bus. We also don‚Äôt have a driving licence, so renting a car isn‚Äôt an option.

If you have any suggestions for things to see or do, local experiences, or possible day trips from these places - or improvements to our itinerary - we‚Äôd be really grateful. Thanks in advance for your ideas!",post,r/JapanTravel,Comedy,3.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/1ksvmw7/3rd_trip_to_japan_itinerary_between/
"Nagoya gets too much hate imo. There's enough stuff to do to occupy 2 days, and there's barely any tourists there, which is a plus imo.",comment_1,r/JapanTravel,Comedy,,https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/1ksvmw7/3rd_trip_to_japan_itinerary_between/
"I would recommend only one day in Ise, but go with a guide. The shrine is beautiful, but really comes to life when you have a guide to explain the history/mythology to you. I would also do it as a day trip from Nagoya rather than going there straight from Osaka.

With another day in Nagoya, you'll have more time for day trips around the region (of which there are many). You can head into Gifu for Shirakawago/Takayama, or into Shiga to see Hikone/OmiHachiman, or check out some lesser known places like Nishio or Seki.

Nagoya is so underrated and is the perfect place to act as a ""home base"" to take day trips from in my opinion.",comment_2,r/JapanTravel,Comedy,,https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/1ksvmw7/3rd_trip_to_japan_itinerary_between/
Hakone is definitely worth the visit. I was there last Summer and it was fairly crowded but everything was handled perfectly. Expect a few lines to get on public transport.,comment_3,r/JapanTravel,Comedy,,https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/1ksvmw7/3rd_trip_to_japan_itinerary_between/
"A few thoughts: 

***Ise:*** 

As u/Naaaasabenya said, you can do the things you want to do in Ise in a single day and it makes more sense to do it as a day trip from Nagoya, as it is closer than Osaka. 

***Nagoya:*** 

Nagoya is a pleasant, albeit industrial, city and there are plenty of things to do around Nagoya. Here's what I've previously commented about Nagoya: 

*Nagoya has Atsuta-jingu, one of the most important Shinto shrines that (apparently) contains one of the Imperial family‚Äôs three sacred treasures.*

*If you‚Äôre interested in technology and engineering, there‚Äôs the Toyota Commemorative Museum of Industry and Technology. There is also an excellent JR railway museum, which includes shinkansen and the experimental maglev train.*

[*https://www.japan-guide.com/e/e2155.html*](https://www.japan-guide.com/e/e2155.html)

*Also, there‚Äôs quite a bit to do in the area around Nagoya.*

* *Inuyama - A town near Nagoya, home to one of Japan‚Äôs oldest original castles perched above the river, with great views. Also has cormorant fishing on the river and some nearby sites associated with the Momotaro legend. It‚Äôs a really nice outing from Nagoya.*
* *Meiji-mura - Near Inuyama, an architectural museum with historic buildings from around Japan that have been moved there. Includes the facade and foyer of the old Imperial Hotel in Tokyo designed by Frank Lloyd Wright. You can do Inuyama and Meiji-mura in the one day.*
* *Ise Jingu - One of the most significant Shinto shrines in Japan. You can‚Äôt see much of the inner shrine, but you can walk through the forest and look at the outer shrine area and buildings near the entrance to the complex.*

*Japan Guide article on Nagoya City:*¬†[*https://www.japan-guide.com/e/e2155.html*](https://www.japan-guide.com/e/e2155.html)

*Article with some suggestions on things to do and see around Nagoya:*¬†[*https://www.japan-guide.com/ad/central-japan/201126.html*](https://www.japan-guide.com/ad/central-japan/201126.html)

You mentioned going to Inuyama and I would highly recommend it. I really like Inuyama-jo (castle) and Meiji-mura. 

***Atami:***

Atami itself isn't really a ""charming little seaside town"". It's filled with lots of concrete buildings erected during the boom days of the 1970s and 1980s and quite a few of them are looking less than ideal nowadays. It does have a beach, but the beaches further south are nicer. However, Kinomiya-jinja is really lovely and well worth visiting. The two shotengai (shopping streets) next to Atami station are also great, with lots of nice little shops, cafes and restaurants. There's also a great, retro kissaten (coffee shop) upstairs directly opposite the train station. 

Further south of Atami, places like Omuroyama and the Jogasaki coast are well worth visiting and we loved our time spent travelling down the Izu Peninsula. There's a fantastic little restaurant in the chairlift building hidden behind a door at the base of Omuroyama.",comment_4,r/JapanTravel,Comedy,,https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/1ksvmw7/3rd_trip_to_japan_itinerary_between/
"I don't know if there are any day use private onsen in Atami; that's kinda modern and Atami is very retro. There is a day use private onsen near Jogasaki Coast at Hanafubuki (no 1st person experience)¬† Also, Atami is not really ""charming seaside town"" but might be comparable to Blackpool or various USA boardwalk towns. It is a dated seaside destination recently experiencing some resurgence. Shimoda is more recommended as an attractive town on Izu Peninsula.¬†¬†


For jazz bars I recommend you visit Asagaya ‚Äì Tokyo's jazz district with 100s of hole in the wall bars ‚Äì best on Thurs-Sat¬†¬†


As for Hakone it is indeed crowded. Worth it if you are interested in the volcanic scenery though and coming from Atami you will outpace the Toyko day-trippers.¬†",comment_5,r/JapanTravel,Comedy,,https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/1ksvmw7/3rd_trip_to_japan_itinerary_between/
"Hiroshima->Okayama(Castle+Korakuen)->Himeji(Castle+Kokoen)->Kobe Itinerary? I am looking to plan my second trip to Japan. I am traveling with one other, and we are no stranger to 25k+ step days.

Also, I‚Äôd personally say Okayama castle is just ‚Äúfine‚Äù. It‚Äôs very similar to Hiroshima castle or Osaka castle, a reconstruction with a museum inside. You may consider skipping it to give you more time elsewhere",comment_2,r/JapanTravel,Comedy,,https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/1ksrvhw/hiroshimaokayamacastlekorakuenhimejicastlekokoenko/
"Now... I have some suggestions for Okayama in a couple of areas.

First, if you are interested in Japanese cityscapes, as others have suggested, you should visit the [Bikan district](https://www.kurashiki-tabi.jp/standard/kurashiki-bikan-historical-quarter/) in Kurashiki. It is a well-developed tourist area and you can enjoy shopping for fashion and crafts.

If you are a Samurai admirer, you may want to visit Bizen. This is the city of traditional Bizen pottery and swords. The [Sword Museum](https://www.city.setouchi.lg.jp/site/token/) is famous. If you are lucky, you will be able to see sword smiths at work in person.

If you are interested in paintings, the Takehisa Yumeji Museum is located next to Korakuen Garden. [Yumeji](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yumeji_Takehisa)(1884-1934) is a modernist painter of the Taisho era, he designed many advertisements and posters in addition to his paintings. His paintings also had a great influence on shoujo manga (girls' manga).

If you are interested in gourmet food, the most recommended food is fruit. Peaches, grapes, olives, and lemons are especially famous.

Interested in myths, legends, and ancient history? [Kibitsuhiko-Jinja](https://www.kibitsuhiko.or.jp/) is dedicated to a prince Kibitsuhiko from a time when mythology was still a part of the land. He is said to be the model for Momotaro, Japan's most famous fairy tale hero. And in [Kibi-ji](https://www.net-japan.info/kibiji/), many ancient tombs and Buddhist architecture coexist. There are few private houses around, and on a clear day, visitors can enjoy the beautiful scenery of nature and Buddhist temples.

The biggest problem is that these locations are quite far apart. It is impossible to visit them all in one day.",comment_3,r/JapanTravel,Comedy,,https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/1ksrvhw/hiroshimaokayamacastlekorakuenhimejicastlekokoenko/

"My trip report: Tokyo, Osaka, Kyoto Reflections on My Trip to Japan

Visiting Japan was an unforgettable experience, full of cultural contrasts and unique moments. Overall, I had a good time, though not without a few gripes. Here‚Äôs a breakdown of what stood out to me‚Äîboth the highlights and the not-so-great parts.

What I Loved:
	‚Ä¢	The people: While generally shy, the locals were incredibly kind once you engaged with them. There‚Äôs a quiet warmth and hospitality that‚Äôs hard to find elsewhere.
	‚Ä¢	Respect culture: I genuinely admired the bowing, the attention to detail, and the small rituals‚Äîlike handing you items with both hands‚Äîthat reflect deep-rooted respect and pride in one‚Äôs work.
	‚Ä¢	Cultural uniqueness: Japan has a distinct, fascinating identity. Everything‚Äîfrom food to etiquette‚Äîfeels uniquely Japanese, and I appreciated that.
	‚Ä¢	No tipping: The lack of a tipping culture is refreshing. Service is excellent, and there are no expectations or awkward calculations at the end of a meal.
	‚Ä¢	Cleanliness: The sidewalks are spotless, and there‚Äôs an evident sense of public responsibility and care.
	‚Ä¢	Transportation: The train system is incredibly efficient, clean, and easy to navigate. Easily one of the best in the world.

What I Didn‚Äôt Love:
	‚Ä¢	Rodent issues: Both Tokyo and Osaka seem to have a noticeable rat problem in certain areas, especially at night.
	‚Ä¢	Bar scene: Many bars are tiny and charge cover fees, which makes bar-hopping difficult and uninviting. The vibe felt more closed-off than fun.
	‚Ä¢	Tourist traps: Areas like Shinjuku and Shibuya are full of overpriced spots. I had meals where I spent $200 on sushi that didn‚Äôt even compare to what I can get back home.
	‚Ä¢	Trash situation: I respect the cultural norm of not eating or drinking while walking, but finding a trash can afterward is surprisingly difficult. Carrying a backpack full of wrappers and bottles gets old fast.
	‚Ä¢	Table charges & ‚Äúfree‚Äù dishes: Those mandatory small plates (usually billed as a cover charge) were universally bland. Cold beans and sesame seeds? Hard pass.
	‚Ä¢	Floor seating: I know it‚Äôs traditional, but sitting on the floor crushed my lower back. A heads-up or option to sit at the bar would‚Äôve gone a long way‚Äîespecially for bigger travelers.
	‚Ä¢	Entertainment outside food/drink: Beyond eating, drinking, and sightseeing, I found entertainment options pretty limited. There weren‚Äôt many shows, performances, or live events that caught my eye.
	‚Ä¢	Pachinko: A total mystery and money pit. I dropped $100 trying to figure it out, hit what I thought was a jackpot, and still didn‚Äôt win‚Äîapparently I was supposed to turn a knob at the right moment? There are no clear instructions, and everything‚Äôs in Japanese. Felt like a tourist trap.
	‚Ä¢	Cosplay culture: I don‚Äôt mean any offense here, but the sudden visual switch from salarymen to young adults dressed in full anime cosplay was jarring. It‚Äôs just‚Ä¶ a lot. That said, the people-watching is top-tier.

Final Thoughts:

Japan was fascinating, beautiful, and at times frustrating. I‚Äôm glad I went, and I‚Äôll carry the memories with me‚Äîbut I‚Äôm not sure I feel the need to return anytime soon.

"""Areas like Shinjuku and Shibuya are full of overpriced spots. I had meals where I spent $200 on sushi ...""  
I mean, going to touristy spots to eat out is also a ripoff elsewhere. It's a bit naive to think otherwise imho.  
  
""Trash situation: ... but finding a trash can afterward is surprisingly difficult.¬†Carrying a backpack full of wrappers and bottles gets old fast.""  
Sorry, but I REALLY don't get that.  
What is so difficult about taking your own trash along?  
Full backpack?! I always had a little plastic bag for trash and it was always plenty enough until I got to the next konbini or hotel room.  
I LOVE the fact that Japan ISN'T littered with trash cans every 20m. And apart from very touristy areas (that seemingly can't carry their trash for more than 5m), it's still perfectly clean. So clearly it's something that isn't hard and is only something some foreigners can't seem to do.

""Pachinko: A total mystery and money pit. I dropped $100 trying to figure it out ... There are no clear instructions, and everything‚Äôs in Japanese. Felt like a tourist trap""  
Not really a tourist trap. They don't expect foreigners at all. Because, yes, it is a money pit. Like all of gambling.  
I honestly never saw a foreigner in there. Just sad old Japanese men.

"I gotta say some of your negative points are crazy to me; you went to Pachinko parlor, a place for gambling, don't speak any Japanese and lost money, what were you expecting? If you think there's limited entertainment options in the largest city on earth, it's likely because you didn't know where or how to look. I would suggest guided tours to help you in this aspect.

Lastly and very importantly to me, you said you love the cleanliness, but hating carrying your trash around. These are the two sides of the coin, if you want things to be clean and nice, everyone must participate and take responsibility for their mess.

Also there's trash bins in every convenience store in the country.",comment_4,r/JapanTravel,Comedy,,https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/1kte0g3/my_trip_report_tokyo_osaka_kyoto/

"~2 week Tokyo trip write up For context this is my second trip to Japan but my first ever time in Tokyo! I visited both Kyoto and Osaka for a 2 week trip back in 2019. I wanted to allot more time in Tokyo specifically since I‚Äôve never been and there‚Äôs such a large volume of things to do in this city that I wanted to see it all. 

One thing I do regret deeply is my itinerary was SO packed. I just wanted to do and see everything and as a result I felt like I was hopping from place to place without a lot of breathing room. I did have days where I wandered and explored at my own pace but some days were running like a chicken with its head cut off. I‚Äôm still overall very happy with how everything turned out, but just some wisdom I wanted to pass on. 

I also want to preface that my preferences will not be the same as yours! I care a lot about soaking up big city vibes, POKEMON, anime merch, character goods, food, photos, shopping. Yes I like temples and nature but those things aren‚Äôt as important to me as the first few things. I definitely wish I took at least 1-2 more day trips though. Or heck even a rest day. But no rest for the wicked! 

Anyways, this was my itinerary: 

5/9: Leave home, fly to Tokyo

5/10: Land at Narita, take Skyliner to Ueno. I found myself wandering through Ameyoko market late at night and stumbling into a delicious local ramen joint. Got some oysters too! Walked around a bit more and soaked in the night life. It was Saturday night. A lot of young people at the izakaya having drinks. 

5/11: Ventured out to Akihabara and shopped around the various anime stores. I remember being shocked by just how many floors each store has! Got a lot of gacha keychains, blind boxes, and anime figurines! There was also a matsuri going on with people carrying mikoshi, chanting, drumming, cheering etc. Good times.

5/12: The pace picked up a bit more this day. Woke up early, took advantage of my jet lag and headed to Tsukiji Fish Market. Tried the tamago, tuna sashimi (melt in your mouth), wagyu skewer (favorite thing I ate), gyudon, oyster, scallops, matcha.. WOW! Then went to Ginza and shopped at Uniqlo and Muji. Got udon. Made our way to Senso-Ji/Asakusa. 

5/13: Meiji Temple in the morning. Spent a lot of time here, wandering through the grounds and hiking through the gardens. Then Shibuya for afternoon/evening. Walked the crossing. Don Quixote. I checked out the Pokemon Center, Nintendo Store, Shonen Jump store at Parco. Then Tower Records! Tried Ichiran just to say I tried it. It was mid. 

5/14: Wandered around the Tokyo Tower area and discovered Maple Waterfall Park! Gorgeous little green space and it was so early that I basically had it to myself. Went to a cafe. Spent the afternoon bumming around Akihabara and Ueno. Strolled through Ueno Park and stumbled across the cutest summer flea market! Picked up very cheap ceramic kitchenware (550 yen a bowl) and some wooden spoons. Had my mind BLOWN at the Tokyo National Museum. Spent a few hours here but wish I had more time. Then went back to accommodation to watch some of the XG concert livestream.

5/15: Mt. Fuji day trip. Literally the HIGHLIGHT of my trip. We got extremely lucky with the visibility so Fujisan looked absolutely beautiful. Stopped at Oshino Hakkai and tried houtou noodles and it was absolutely scrumptious! Took pictures at Lawson. Wandered around little streets in the village nearby. Went to Lake Kawaguchi. Took the cable car up to a viewing point. Saw some swans and fish at another lake area. 

Once I got back to Tokyo I saw LiSA in concert! It was my very first Japanese concert so the etiquette was TOTALLY different but I adjusted very quickly. She was absolutely amazing. Then I just bummed around Shinjuku after the concert lol. 

5/16: Ikebukuro day! Spent a lot of today ambling around Sunshine City and various doujinshi/BL stores lol. Dropped by Pokemon Center Ikebukuro. This area definitely has a different vibe than Akihabara. Went to TeamLabs which I thought was overall quite a mid experience. Then made my way back to accommodation and on the way back saw the Miyazaki clock! WOW! 

5/17: DISNEY SEA DAY! I got there a few hours before opening and bolted to Fantasy Springs area. Got to do the Peter Pan, Rapunzel, and Tinkerbell rides. Frozen was closed. Did Journey, 20k Leagues, Soaring, Indiana Jones, and Nemo rides too! At the end of the day I was so exhausted. It was also POURING rain that day.

5/18: This day was kind of crazy, so buckle up. Woke up at dawn and immediately bolted to the Your Name stairs. What‚Äôs insane is there were already a few people taking pictures! But it was overall very serene and quiet. I checked out the Suga Shrine right next to it. Hit up a vending machine and just vibed. Then I made the stupid but also chaotic decision to WALK to the Imperial Palace. So I did. Hit up a konbini for a cold drink and just‚Ä¶ walked and walked. I feel like I saw a lot of quieter neighborhoods this way too. The Imperial Palace gardens were‚Ä¶ meh. I liked the koi fish and cool twisty trees though. 

You‚Äôd think the day is wrapping up but we are just getting started. Ambled over to Tokyo Station to explore Character Street. Went to the Pokemon Center Tokyo DX. Chilled a bit at a cafe. 

Not done yet! Then I took the train ALL the way to Shimokitazawa. Had to transfer through Shibuya so I stood and watched the crossing. Ducked into a few vintage clothing stores, nothing really piqued my interest. Then back to Shinjuku to watch Godzilla do its thing. Ended the day at Golden Gai and befriended a local! 

5/19: This day was also quite insane. I think as the days went on and I realized my trip was ending soon I wanted to do EVERYTHING. Got breakfast with some friends I haven‚Äôt seen since college. Smoothies at 7-11 and walked around. Went to Dengama in the kitchenware district. Shibuya Sky. Then went to my Pokemon cafe reservation. Got dinner with a different group of friends. Won some plushies at the arcade. And then finally a private onsen to end the night. 

5/20: Last day. Went to Tokyo Tower again and looked around the mall/shopping area attached to it. Took some final pictures. Then went to Narita for flight home. Got some curry. Hit up a couple souvenir shops. Then goodbye Japan!",post,r/JapanTravel,Comedy,34.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/1ksavga/2_week_tokyo_trip_write_up/

"I would look at flying down to Osaka, rather than catching the train given you are already at the airport and having to drag luggage around, navigate the train system & multiple changes etc while tired/ jet lagged.",comment_1,r/JapanTravel,Comedy,,https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/1kt82ni/help_us_plan_our_dream_japan_anniversary_trip/
"Please for your own sanity, don't go in early to mid July. I grew up in Florida going to Orlando in July. I thought I could handle it, but doing Kyoto in heat index of 100 to 112 F, looking at 1200 year old monuments which obviously don't have AC was miserable. If you absolutely must go in August, I would highly recommend making the most of Osaka's underground tunnels and malls associated to their subway system. Likewise in Tokyo, I would focus on staying in the various malls and arcades that are climate controlled.

Markets like Tsukiji are huge tourist traps with massive up charges on the food. You can find better ones in places like Kanazawa and Kobe. 

You probably won't find much of the traditional rural Japan culture on the golden route. I would consider staying in a Ryokan in an onsen town to experience bath culture. Obviously because of the heat, you would be better off in the Japanese Alps in places like Shibu Onsen in Nagano or Kusatsu Onsen in Gunma but those are like 1-2 hrs north of Tokyo. You can also experience rural Japan in places like the Koyasan temple complex in Wakayama 1-2 hours south of Kyoto and Osaka or in Shizuoka, the halfway point between Kansai region and Tokyo. Kurama and Kibune at the end of Kyoto's metro system are also super nice and higher altitude to avoid the heat. Kyoto locals do that frequently since it's also way less touristy to the extent that some restaurants even refuse to let foreigners in.

Hiking some of the Nakasendo trail, the historic route between Tokyo and Kyoto will show you some traditional Japan and pop you out by Matsumoto in Nagano which has a really cool castle if you don't visit Osaka or Himeji castle in Kansai. 

Trains are tricky. I would genuinely be surprised if flying in to Tokyo then taking bullet trains to Osaka would be cheaper then flying into Osaka and one waying to Tokyo. Bullet train tickets cost as much as flights, and you're better off on local trains between places like Osaka and Kyoto even though they take marginally longer since they only cost like $10.",comment_2,r/JapanTravel,Comedy,,https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/1kt82ni/help_us_plan_our_dream_japan_anniversary_trip/

"You're forgetting to allow for fatigue and jet lag - you will be totally wrecked by the time you arrive at Osaka, so just go to bed. I doubt you'll be wanting to go on cruises the next night either.

You don't need to take a special train to Nara or the Shinkansen from Osaka to Kyoto - the regular JR trains will be the cheapest and quickest options.

I'm also very doubtful that flying into Haneda, getting public transport into central Tokyo, a Shinkansen to Shin-Osaka and then the Osaka subway to your hotel would be faster than just flying from Haneda to KIX and then getting a train into the city. Remember again that you'll be smashed by jet lag, so flying will be simpler as you won't need to faff about with unfamiliar train systems - remember to allow a healthy allowance to the Google Maps travel time estimates for the time it will take you to find your way around train stations, etc (I've been through Tokyo Station about 6 times, and gotten totally lost each time).",comment_5,r/JapanTravel,Comedy,,https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/1kt82ni/help_us_plan_our_dream_japan_anniversary_trip/

"Okinomiyaki, do it in Hiroshima.

I would make day 4 in a trip to Koya San and stay in a temple. Currently you have a lot of super touristy stuff on that day.
Day 5 is super packed. Better to split it between 5 and 6 and enjoy the afternoon in a onzen.
That way you have a better trip at day 7 luggage in trains in Japan is a big no no. And with the luggage service you don't need to go to the hotel but you can go straight into the city. While your luggage is waiting at check-in.
Day 8 I would go to Nara and to Inari on the way back. Different train but stops right in front.

Would go to teamlabs borderless instead of planets. 

My best advise, use the luggage services everywhere. If you need to ship your bags a day before make a small day pack with the stuff you need. This will save you so much time and add almost 2 full days of time to your trip plus the whole train travel will be a breeze. You will be laughing at all tourists carrying those big suitcases around.",comment_3,r/JapanTravel,Comedy,,https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/1ksqfst/thoughts_on_this_2week_itinerary_is_it_realistic/

This was our first time in Japan; we flew into and out of Tokyo Narita Airport and stayed in Tokyo and Kyoto, with a day trip to Osaka.

Our itinerary:

Day 0 | Travel Day

We flew 15 hours directly from our hometown to Narita, losing a day in the process. This flight was pretty brutal - if yours is as long as ours, bring plenty of snacks and entertainment. 

Day 1 | Arrival in Tokyo

Since we were staying in Ueno, we prebooked Narita Skyliner Express tickets on Klook. It was super easy to hop on, and there was space for our luggage. We checked into our hotel, freshened up, and then went on a Ueno food and drinks tour. We had a great time trying things we wouldn't have otherwise ordered (think pickled plums, chicken esophagus, and whiskey highballs). 

Day 2 | Explore Tokyo: Ueno, Yanaka, Nippori, Asakusa, and Akihabara

We started off the day with a hotel breakfast then wandered some of Tokyo's quieter neighborhoods for the morning. I love to sew, so I spent quite a bit of time in Nippori's fabric town. After visiting Senso-ji temple and grabbing *Okonomiyaki* in Asakusa, we took a brief nap back at our hotel before exploring Akihabara's electric city. I won't lie - Asakusa and Akihabara were tough due to the crowds. We really enjoyed Yanaka and Nippori though! 

Day 3 | Explore Tokyo: Shinjuku, Harajuku, and Shibuya

We started today with a visit to the Metropolitan Government building to see the great views then bopped over to the Sompo Insurance Museum to see Van Gogh's sunflowers (my favorite painting) before heading to Harajuku where we explored Yoyogi Park, Meiji Jingu, and Takeshita Street before grabbing lunch at Kura Sushi. We have a Kura at home, so it was fun to compare the experience! We then do a kintsuki pottery workshop in Harajuku before heading to Shibuya to experience to famous crosswalk and see the Nintendo store and Pokemon Center. Shibuya was also very crowded but wasn't quite as overwhelming as Akihabara (I think because there's more room to breathe). After a ramen dinner, we headed back to the hotel. 

Day 4 | Tokyo Disney Sea

This was the day we were most intimidated by, but it ended up being one of the most pleasant of our trip! We waited in line for about 30 minutes before opening and experienced all of the rides we wanted to see. We lost the lottery to see the big band performance but otherwise enjoyed exploring, riding rides, and trying all the snacks we wanted. My favorite was the soy sauce popcorn! I also liked looking at the merch - I snagged a couple of Duffy items for our nieces and nephews back home, since they're not available in the States. 

Day 5 | Tokyo --> Kyoto

Today we grabbed our last hotel breakfast and boarded the *shinkansen* for Kyoto. Like the rest of Japanese public transit, it was super easy to link our pre-booked tickets to our IC cards and hop on. We prebooked seats in the oversized baggage area to stash away our suitcases. We grabbed some bento boxes from Ueno station before boarding, and we even saw Mt. Fuji along our way! 

Once we checked into our room at a traditional ryokan, we temple-hopped and explored Gion. We started at Kiyomizu-dera and worked our way up Ninenzaka to Yasaka, visiting all the little shrines and shops that caught our attention along the way. Crowds were pretty brutal, but that's what we expected for the afternoon. Once we got our fill of temples, we participated in a traditional tea ceremony where we dressed up in traditional kimono and took lots of photos. Then, we bopped to Nishiki Market and grabbed street food for dinner before going back to enjoy the onsen at our ryokan. Tbh, the little taco stand outside of Nishiki Market was one of my favorite meals! 

Day 6 | Explore Kyoto: Arashiyama

We began with a traditional Japanese breakfast at our ryokan before heading over to see the famous bamboo grove and Okochi Sanso Gardens. The bamboo grove was already popping by 9am with wannabe photographers, but the gardens were blissfully empty save us and 1-2 other couples. We then took the Sagano romance train up and a Katsura river boat ride back down. Both were fun and offered great views!

After this, we took a taxi to Kinkaku-ji to see the lovely golden pavilion and grabbed a delicious eel dinner nearby before turning in early to our ryokan. 

Day 7 | Osaka Day Trip

We really lucked out on weather, because today was the only day it really rained, and we had planned on being mostly indoors anyways. We took the train to Osaka, visited the Castle museum, grabbed an incredible soba + tempura lunch, then headed to the Aquarium where we were greeted by the incredible whale shark. I think we stood there watching them for at least 45 minutes. We then made our way to Dotonbori to try more street foods and people watch. 

Today was probably our most crowded/stressful day with all of the commuting across Osaka, but I was glad we got to see what we did! We took the train back to Kyoto, stopping by Fushimi Inari on our way to see the famous red tori gates at night. We happened to stumble across a mama wild boar and her babies, so be careful if you go late to avoid crowds!

Day 8 | Kyoto --> Tokyo

We enjoyed a tea ceremony at our ryokan before catching the shinkansen back to Tokyo. Once we checked into our final hotel, we headed to Ginza to shop for souvenirs and eat some delicious bougie sushi.  For our last night, we balled out and got a room at the Imperial Hotel overlooking the imperial palace and ate wagyu with champagne at one of their many restaurants. It was so delicious and very fun since we had the place to ourselves - there was even a live pianist!

Day 9 | Last day in Tokyo!

Our flight was at 5pm, so we spent the morning enjoying the nearby palace gardens and grabbed a last lunch at Tsukiji Outer Market before making our way back to Ueno to board the Narita Express again.



**Highlights of the Trip:**

\- Our fantastic ryokan in Kyoto

\- Nippori fabric town

\- Harajuku (I liked Takeshita Street way more than I thought I would)

\- Tokyo DisneySea



**Lowlights:**

\- Osaka wasn't my cup of tea, but I'm still glad we went!

\- Crowds in tourist areas (not surprising, since we are tourists, after all)

\- General feeling of stress navigating public transit if you're not used to it (we are from a car-centric city and only use public transit when we travel. Thankfully, Japan's metro and bus system is pretty easy to get the hang of, but there were several moments when we got overwhelmed!)

  
The next time we visit Japan, we'd likely stay the entire time in Tokyo and do more day trips to places we wished we had visited, like Nikko, Kamakura, and Hakone. Overall, we had a lovely time, and I wish you all the best in planning your own trips to Japan! It was a great honeymoon, and we can't wait to go back as soon as we can!",post,r/JapanTravel,Comedy,18.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/1ks6eh9/trip_report_9_day_japan_honeymoon/

Osaka 3 nights - 
Day trip to Nara, overnight stay at Kyoto - 
3 more nights in Kyoto -

"My first trip to Japan - 12 days - not a shopper I'm going to Japan at the end of next month! It's a last minute trip and I will be joining my sister-in-law, who grew up there, for a portion of the time.  (She takes my niece and nephew to her hometown each summer to visit family and attend the local elementary school.)

My itinerary is bare bones because I don't like to over plan.  I am really not a shopper, but I enjoy visiting historical and cultural sites and nature. I would like to take a cooking or art class... any suggestions would be greatly appreciated! 

Day 0-3: Tokyo 

* I'll be at the airport for a few hours before my family, so I'll buy my Suica card.
* Sister-in-law will take me and the kids sight-seeing. (Asakusa, Shibuya, Ueno Park)
* We have tickets to Teamlabs Planets

Day 4: Train to sister-in-law's village in Shimada

Day 5: Spend time on extended family's ranch, visit the river, hang out with the kids

Day 6: Train to Kinosaki (remainder of trip is solo)

* Say goodbye to family and continue solo to Kinosaki
* Planning to make the express train that arrives around 4pm
* Check into guesthouse
* Walk around town, relax in onsen for a few hours 

Day 7: Kinosaki

* Morning: Take ropeway to shrine and hike
* Afternoon: Considering renting a bike and exploring surrounding area
* Evening: visit Onsen again

Day 8: Train to Kyoto

* Arrive by 3p to check in at hotel (near station) and drop off luggage
* Evening tour of Fushimi Inari

Day 9: Day trip to Hiroshima

* Free walking tour at Hiroshima memorial Park
* Visit the famous Shinto Shrine / Tori Gate

Day 10: Kyoto

* Early Morning: Monkey Park
* Late Afternoon: Visit Gion district
* Souvenir shopping? 

Day 11: Day trip to Nara

* Visit a museum, explore, eat some food
* Deer Park
* Giant Buddha

Day 12: Depart

* Take train from Kyoto back to Tokyo to make 5pm flight.

**My Main worry:**    I will be solo for the last portion of my trip and this will be the first time I've travelled to a country solo where I don't know the language. Will I get lost on the trains? Seems overwhelming--*regional, local, express, highspeed, basic fare, different machines for different ticket types....* oh my!!  I have an Android and based on recommendations on this sub I've downloaded the Smartex app, the Navitime app, and I plan to but a Welcome Suica? card when I arrive at the airport...though I don't know if I require ALL three of these things. Any other apps I need?",post,r/JapanTravel,Comedy,40.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/1krytr2/my_first_trip_to_japan_12_days_not_a_shopper/
We rented a pocket wifi on our first trip as we didn't want to incur roaming fees. That and Google maps and Google translate were enough to get us by on our first trip. The image function where it live translates signs and such were a big help.,comment_1,r/JapanTravel,Comedy,,https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/1krytr2/my_first_trip_to_japan_12_days_not_a_shopper/
Do Inari on the way back from Nara. It saves you a lot of time and an extra day.,comment_2,r/JapanTravel,Comedy,,https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/1krytr2/my_first_trip_to_japan_12_days_not_a_shopper/
"I've been to Japan multiple times, and T-mobile basic international plan 2G is absolute garbage. It loads so slow, and there's a bunch of gray areas where you don't even get a signal. I would not rely on this. This is just not in Japan but in Hong Kong and China as well.

Since it's your first trip, I'd recommend getting an esim. You don't have to carry a pocket wifi, and it's pretty affordable. Look on Trip, search for Japan Esim, you'll see this 

""Japan SoftBank Docomo eSIM Day Pass / Data Package | 1-30 ...

4.7/5 3.4k reviews 79.7k booked""

For 12 days you get 5G speed and 1G per day, it's about $7.00

I'd pay that price for peace of mind throughout the entire trip. There is no need to look around for wifi here and there. You can browse on your phone during the shinkansen rides and look up local restaurants in the local area.

Don't be like me during the first trip standing in the corner for 10-30 minutes for my 2G to load back in 2015. 


Huge waste of time.. never again, esim all the way.

Edit - I was recently in Tokyo for a long layover back in Oct 2024. My 2G barely loaded from HND airport to Ikebukuro station. Bought an esim immediately for a dollar for two days. Extremely fast and easy to set up.",comment_3,r/JapanTravel,Comedy,,https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/1krytr2/my_first_trip_to_japan_12_days_not_a_shopper/
"currently solo in japan on day 2 of 20 - ZERO plans, first solo trip, first time off my home continent‚Ä¶   for sure go the ESIM route. i used holafly with unlimited data, admittedly expensive, but i use my phone and its data almost constantly, especially in japan. it was SO easy to activate as soon as i landed, and its been very very fast and reliable, with great customer support. please look into esims, dont get a wifi box and stress about keeping it charged.   another one, especially if you dont know a lick of japanese, is DeepL, an AI translation app that does a decent enough job with japanese. not sure the reputation of it, but from my experience AI does a better job of contextualizing a VERY contextual language than google translate, although maybe times have changed.  besides that, naw not too many apps out there that will make your trip easier. google maps is your best friend here. the people are very kind. just respect and please learn the culture and the country, and its people guaranteed will welcome you and help you",comment_4,r/JapanTravel,Comedy,,https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/1krytr2/my_first_trip_to_japan_12_days_not_a_shopper/
"I have T-Mobile with the basic international plan so I shouldn't have to worry about roamin. I know it will be slow but I hope by downloading maps when I have wifi and by using the Japan Wi-Fi app someone recommended, I'll be okay. üôèüèæ",comment_5,r/JapanTravel,Comedy,,https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/1krytr2/my_first_trip_to_japan_12_days_not_a_shopper/
"Itinerary check please (12 days) Our first time in Japan! Some things to note: our friends really didn't enjoy Osaka, and said Mt Fuji was a bit boring.

QUESTION: is there anywhere we can get a standalone outdoor onsen experience? Without booking a ryokan or hotel. We didn't know for most of these you had to be a guest to use the onsen.",post,r/JapanTravel,Comedy,0.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/1ksi1sp/itinerary_check_please_12_days/
"I would be careful with making other people's experiences yours. We got told Mt Fuji is nothing but a day trip and Kyoto should be a day trip from Osaka. Boy was that a bad recommendation for us. After visiting Japan multiple times in the past 12 months, Kyoto and Mt Fuji became our favourite places where we spent over a week all together. 

That being said, your excursion looks pretty relaxed. Your trip to Nara for example takes up a whole day, but there is only so much to do and see at Nara. You could easily peak at Uni right next to Nara, home of Matcha and a real beautiful place. Or visit the Nintendo museum if you are into that. If you, however, want to take it slow and are open to take a look around corners to discover hidden gems Japan has to offer, it's a good plan. 

I have only ever seen public onsens which can be used without a reservation in Hakone, but they certainly do exist yes.",comment_1,r/JapanTravel,Comedy,,https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/1ksi1sp/itinerary_check_please_12_days/
Thanks. You make a good point,comment_2,r/JapanTravel,Comedy,,https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/1ksi1sp/itinerary_check_please_12_days/
"Just left Kyoto yesterday. My only flags are that the time you plan on going to Kiyomizu-dera and Higashiyama will be packed. That being said, I think that area is alwaya just crowded.

My other flag is that if you can swing it go even earlier to Fushimi Inari. We did it at 5:30am saw all of three people on our hike up. Coming down around 7am it was definitely getting busy. And this was all in the pouring rain. 

I agree with the other commenter, other people's experiences won't necessarily be your own. For example, I really enjoyed Kyoto, and was encouraged to do more than 4 nights. I adjust my itinerary slightly. We did 5 nights and honestly I would have been fine with 4 nights (including a day trip). I could have put the extra night somewhere else on our trip. We templed out quicker than I expected.",comment_3,r/JapanTravel,Comedy,,https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/1ksi1sp/itinerary_check_please_12_days/

"You can eat lunch at the Cup Noodle Museum, just keep in mind it's literally just the different Nissen cup noodles from different countries. I had it more as a snack. I did enjoy the museum overall though.

I only did an afternoon in Yokohama as I did Kamakura early in the morning. Did the museum, Gundam robot when it was still there, walked around the waterfront and gardens there. Then I stopped at the Yokohama Brewing taproom (good) and then had dinner at a random izakaya which was buried deep in a neighborhood. Fumbled my way through as they spoke almost no English and only had a chalkboard menu, drank way too much sake over the course of a couple of hours while not ordering enough food, and had to navigate the trains back to my hotel in Shimbashi while pretty drunk lol.

"North Korea Spy Ship museum is worth a half hour or so look.  Free.

Its by the Red Brick warehouses (also good for 20-30 mins).

Cable car? Not worth it.  Can walk it in 10 mins along the waterfront.

  
If its clear (unlikely until November), views or sunset from Landmark Tower?

Sankeien¬†Garden is likely the best part of your list.  Id spend most time there.",comment_4,r/JapanTravel,Comedy,,https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/1krxrgf/yokohama_day_trip_itinerary/
"Definitely doable in a day. I would start off in Sankeien grade, go to Minato Mirai, then MM (you can get lunch somewhere in the mall) > ferris wheel > cup noodle museum > RBW > Chinatown so that everything lines up for your walk.

"Itinerary Check and Feedback Hi everyone. I've been perusing the subreddit for a couple months reading your advice and feedback to others and it's been helpful. My husband and I are going to Japan for a week and a half in early October and I've finally put together a rough draft of an itinerary.

I've done lots of research but I still need to look more into the specifics of things, especially for getting around (how to use the buses and metro, etc.). So I'd appreciate any feedback or tips you can offer. Not just related to that, but to anything that seems applicable. We are both first-timers to Japan.

My husband really wants to have wandering time and take it all in. So if there's a day where it seems like we didn't plan much, it's because we intend to just explore and walk freely around at our own pace and check stuff out.

**Day One:**

Land in Narita in the afternoon Japan time. Get through immigration, get luggage, catch a train over to Tokyo. I know we are going to be exhausted because of the time difference (coming from USA), so I didn't plan really anything for the first day except for finding dinner. Our hotel is in Shinjuku close to Omoide Yokocho, so I figured we'd walk over to it and find dinner there while also sight-seeing it, then go to the hotel and go to bed early.

**Day Two:**

Some shopping (Tower Records)

Shinjuku Gyoen National Garden

Meiji Jingu Shrine

**Day Three:** 

Head up to Kawagoe for Wood Works Kawagoe. 

Explore a bit after the chopstick making at Wood Works, but then come back because I have read that a half-day here is pretty sufficient and there's not much else to do.

Spend the other half of the day exploring Shibuya after coming back down from Kawagoe. Pokemon Center in Shibuya

Try to get a ticket for the Shibuya Sky observation deck specifically around sunset.

**Day Four:**

Sens≈ç-ji Temple

Explore Asakusa and Ueno (we do want some wandering time here, but I'll also still take recs for what specifically would be worth our time here as well if we want to plan anything else)

**Day Five:**

teamLab Borderless

Imperial Palace

Pokemon Center Tokyo DX

Pokemon Cafe, assuming I can get a reservation

**Day Six:**

Check out of Tokyo hotel. Take train to Hakone

Here's where I could use some tips. We have to check into our ryokan in Gora (the Madoka No Mori) at 3 pm, and out the next morning by 10 or 11 am (after which we are headed to Kyoto). Once we've checked in, we want to just stay and enjoy the onsens, so we don't plan to leave. But if we get in from Tokyo early enough, and also book a later train to Kyoto after check-out, then i figure we'd have time to do the Hakone Open Air Museum and the Hakone Ropeway (one before check in on day Six, and the other after check out on Day 7, before we head to Kyoto). We won't have our bags because we'll forward them from Tokyo to Kyoto, so that won't be an issue.

So what I am wondering is, would one of them (museum and ropeway) be better to do before check in after coming from Tokyo and one better after check out, before heading to Kyoto? Or does it not really matter?

**Day Seven:**

Check out of Gora Madoka No Mori and do one of the activities I discussed in the paragraph above.

Take train to Kyoto

Check in to hotel, take it easy, Just find dinner and explore Gion (our hotel is in Gion).

**Day Eight:**

Kodai-ji Temple and Bamboo Forest

Kiyomizu-dera Temple

Yasaka Shrine

(Do those in the morning because they are all pretty close together (10-15 minute walks apart)

For afternoon:

Possibly either Ginkaku-ji Temple or Kinkaku-ji Temple

**Day Nine:**

Osaka Day Trip from Kyoto. Take train to Osaka.

Osaka Castle (morning)

Shitennoji Temple (morning)

Shinsekai District  (afternoon)

Namba Yasaka Jinja (afternoon)

Dotonbori for dinner and vibes before heading back to Kyoto in the evening

**Day Ten:**

Fushimi Inari (morning)

Nintendo Museum (afternoon). If able to get tickets. May not be able to. The backup plan is either Ginkaku-ji Temple or Kinkaku-ji Temple, whichever one we didn't go to on Day 8.

**Day Eleven:**

Train to Tokyo, and flight home. If we can forward our luggage to the airport, so that we don't have to haul it around, we may be able to try to sightsee a bit since our flight isn't until 4:30 pm? But we have to get to Narita from Kyoto which will take a while so probably not.

That's my current loose plan. I'd appreciate any feedback - thanks in advance.",post,r/JapanTravel,Comedy,2.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/1ks5k48/itinerary_check_and_feedback/
"It probably doesn‚Äôt matter that much, but if it‚Äôs cloudy/rainy/windy on day 6, I would go to the museum in the hopes that day 7 will be clearer and you‚Äôll have a better chance of seeing Mt Fuji on the ropeway (and if the weather is severe, the ropeway might even be shut down)",comment_1,r/JapanTravel,Comedy,,https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/1ks5k48/itinerary_check_and_feedback/
"First, when you arrive in Japan, get an IC card or app such as Suica. You can travel seamlessly on public transport throughout Japan. If you charge it, you can pass through the ticket gates just by tapping it, without having to calculate the fare and buy a ticket at each station. They are very convenient because you can purchase them without cash not only on public transport but also at all vending machines and convenience stores.",comment_2,r/JapanTravel,Comedy,,https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/1ks5k48/itinerary_check_and_feedback/
"Seems pretty doable.  We did Tokyo and Kyoto in 10 days with a day trip to Nara which was nice.  On the way back to the airport you can leave your luggage in lockers in the station, there are a number of spots in Tokyo Station.  The most lockers are in the East-West connector corridor.  We did this while we did a little more in Tokyo before the flight.",comment_3,r/JapanTravel,Comedy,,https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/1ks5k48/itinerary_check_and_feedback/
"This looks sensible, though your Osaka day is probably too busy.

>Our hotel is in Shinjuku close to Omoide Yokocho, so I figured we'd walk over to it and find dinner there while also sight-seeing it

I'm not sure what other people's experiences have been, but Omoide Yokocho hasn't seemed especially tourist-friendly when I've passed through. I'd suggest just going to one of the many hundreds of mid-priced restaurants in Shinjuku near your hotel as these would be much easier to use when you're zonked.

If you can, fly home from Osaka to save a day.",comment_4,r/JapanTravel,Comedy,,https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/1ks5k48/itinerary_check_and_feedback/

"First Time Itinerary for Summer Visit - Thoughts? My family of 4 (kids are 8 and 11) are leaving for Japan on June 23rd for a 2.5 week trip. Before booking this trip I did not realize how unpleasant the summer weather can be, especially around Tokyo/Kyoto. We just made a big decision to alter our itinerary to seek out slightly better weather (and maybe slightly fewer crowds). See my proposed itinerary below and let me know your thoughts. We are shifting from Kyoto area which was previously planned to Nagano and surrounds and then heading to the Japanese Alps. 

I'm nervous about this switch since it is sort of last minute. Does anyone have experience with these areas and have some tips or think we are leaving out a cool destination or must do activity? Are we doing too much? We want some city time but are most excited about smaller towns that have culture, nature, onsen experiences and good food. As excited as I was for Kyoto this shift in plan just ensures we will be coming back to Japan another time (and at a better time of year next time!). 

June 24th: Arrival in Tokyo (Narita) at 3pm, check into hotel in Asakusa, explore and go to bed

June 25th Tokyo: Morning exploration of Asakusa, Sumo experience, afternoon/evening head to Ahikabara or Shibuya.

June 26th: Tokyo: Teamlab Planets in morning, explore a different neighborhood in afternoon 

June 27th: Tokyo: Day trip from Tokyo (Nikko, Chofu, Kamakura....open to thoughts and ideas?)

June 28th: Nagano: Explore more of Tokyo in the morning and then train to Nagano. Spend afternoon exploring Zenko-ji temple.

June 29th: Nagano: Day trip to Togakushi Shrine area and Ninja House/Museum

June 30th: Nagano: Travel to nearby Snow Monkey Park area. Stay in ryokan and visit the monkeys/hike.

July 1st: Matsumoto: Train to Matsumoto. Visit the castle and explore city (maybe do a family cooking class)

July 2nd: Hirayu Onsen: Bus 1.5 hrs to Kamikochi. Spend half day there with picnic and hike then bus 30 minutes to Hirayu Onsen. Overnight at ryokan there.

July 3rd: Takayama: Bus to Takayama. Spend afternoon exploring the town (Showa museum for sure)

July 4th: Takayama: Spend morning exploring market. Then, day trip to Shirakawa-Go

July 5th: Gujo Hachiman: Train to Gujo Hachiman. Stay overnight. This small ""water city"" has caught my fancy and I'm excited to just explore it and take in the atmosphere. It is on the way to Nagoya so I thought we'd stop over but it does require a train transfer or two so perhaps it is too much. 

July 6th: Nagoya: Enjoy morning in Gujo Hachiman then take train to Nagoya. Check into hotel and explore (any tips for the city?)

July 7th: Nagoya: Long day. Wake up early and get to Ghibli Park. End of day catch train to Tokyo (Ueno). Check in and go to sleep.

July 8th: Tokyo: Explore anything we had left on our list, last minute shopping

July 9th: Tokyo: Fly out at 5pm",post,r/JapanTravel,Comedy,2.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/1ks2u3q/first_time_itinerary_for_summer_visit_thoughts/

"Don't know how firm this is but I'd just do one night in Nagano - train up from Tokyo in the morning, Togakushi for that day, monkey park (it's June, there's no snow) then onto Matsumoto.


Both Togakushi & Jigokudani (monkey park) aren't all day activities so you'll have plenty of time to see Zenko-ji.¬†


Matsumoto - go to the Modern Art Museum, it's really good.¬†


Nagoya - Science Museum is fantastic, your kids will love it.¬†


Takayama - Hida Folk Museum is better than Shirakawago in my opinion. Less people for sure.¬†


Don't think you're doing too much - definitely not enough in Tokyo so I'd see if you can claw back extra time in your trip (Nagano, Matsumoto) etc. Day Trip - Kamakura (it's a very old town/shrine heavy itinerary so at least Kamakura is something different with the beach too).¬†


Weather will be OK, certainly didn't need to replan your trip - peak summer July - September. June will be hot but not as humid, or raining.¬†",comment_3,r/JapanTravel,Comedy,,https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/1ks2u3q/first_time_itinerary_for_summer_visit_thoughts/

"Best Culinary experience of my life in Hiroshima So, after a day of intense travelling (we took the Shinkansen to Nara and back to Hiroshima), me and my wife were craving for a nice warm food. We were tired of Okonomiakis and Tepannyakis so I looked up google and found a Grill restaurant, **Grill Hikoboshi**. We kinda took a while to find it since it's located in the second floor of a little commerce, but we found it. Climbed the stairs to face a closed door. Knocked and got in... the chef was quite surprised to see us, he was either expecting someone else or he wasn't expecting anyone, but he greeted us and sat us in. He was cleaning the kitchen, organizing stuff, doing all the chores to start working. He didn't speak much english, almost nothing to be honest, but the language barrier was beaten with google and a huge paper dictionary he had there! He gave us the wine and drinks menu, asked us we liked and disliked and proceed to start cooking. No menu, no nothing, we sensed that everything was to be out of his head. A profound unconfortable silence filled in the room, we were scared what that japanese guy was thinking, and man, our bet in the restaurant paid off! After a while the plates started coming, first a blowtorched sashimi dipped in a lemon juice, so full of flavour, like I never had a sashimi before. We sensed the chef was keen on talking to we started chatting, he wanted to know the fish we liked in Brazil, the dishes we liked, just ""elevator"" chat,  then proceed to the second course, a vines salads, with lots of different spices and plants, things I never tried before, the salad was as flavoured as main course. More talk, he wanted to know our toughts about the city, Japan, we talked about his experience, then came the third course, a sensational fresh sardine in the super aromatic salad. Whe I saw the sardine I immediately thought of a canned sardine and tought that would be an awful tasting fish... I couldn't be ""wronger""! What a delicicous sardine, I never thought a simple sardine could be so delicious in that prepare. To end it all, the main course, a set of Hiroshima steak, cooked and grilled to perfection, that ting melted in my mouth, I'm an avid mean eater, but i never tasted anything like that. Just like every japanese food, almost no salt was used, but it was seasoned perfectly, gosh, what a wonderful meat piece. For dessert he served us a creme brul√©e style pot that was absolutely delicious too. The whole experience must have taken us some 2 to 3 hours, and we were absolutely shocked with the freshness and variety of flavours he ""invented' with all those ingredients. it wasn't cheap, but it was worth, for us, every yen! Grill Hikoboshi, a very very veyr pleasant surprise in Hiroshima.",post,r/JapanTravel,Comedy,200.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/1kr5yrz/best_culinary_experience_of_my_life_in_hiroshima/

"Itinerary Check: 14 nights between Tokyo, Nikko, Takayama, Kyoto I've previously been to Tokyo, Kyoto, Osaka (+ a day trip to Hiroshima) but my wife has never been. How does the below look for a 14 night trip?  too much movement or any place you would add a day?

* Nights 1-4: **Tokyo**
   * Day 1: arrive, explore shinjuku, shibuya
   * Day 2: Meiji Shrine & Yoyogi Park; Takeshita Street; Omotesando; hibuya Scramble Crossing + Hachiko Statue; Shinjuku at night
   * Day 3: Senso-ji Temple and Nakamise Shopping Street (Asakusa); Tokyo Skytree or Sumida River walk; Ueno Park (optional: Tokyo National Museum or Ueno Zoo); Akihabara
   * Day 4: Possible day trip to Kamakura or Yokohama or just relax
* Nights 5+ 6: **Nikko**
   * Day 5: Depart Tokyo by train to Nikko (\~2 hours) ; Toshogu Shrine, Shinkyo Bridge, and Rinno-ji
   * Day 6: Visit Kegon Falls and Lake Chuzenji ; light hiking or a relaxing onsen experience
* Night 7: **Tokyo** **stopover** (breaking up travel day from Nikko to Takayama); 
   * Day 7: Tokyo Stopover - travel day back from Nikko , use as rest day before heading to Takayama
* Nights 8+9: **Takayama**
   * Day 8: Morning train to Takayama (via Nagoya, \~4.5 hrs total) ; Explore Sanmachi Suji ; Visit a local sake brewery; stay in ryokan
   * Day 9: Visit Hida Folk Village (Hida no Sato) **;** Morning market along the Miyagawa River

   * day 14: train back to Tokyo for 1 last night in Tokyo before flight

So:

* 6 nights total in Tokyo
* 2 nights in Nikko
* 2 nights in Takayama
* 4 nights in Kyoto

Anything you would change? Maybe 1 less night in Tokyo to add to one of the shorter stays? Maybe add a night in Kyoto to do a day trip to either Osaka or Hiroshima or Nara?

For Day 7 I'd consider staying in Nagoya for the evening.

"Plus Size at USJ I‚Äôve lurked on Reddit for a while prior to my trip to see what would work for me at USJ and what wouldn‚Äôt. Now that I‚Äôve completed my USJ visit, here‚Äôs how it went:

(Context: US18 women‚Äôs, most of weight is carried in midsection and chest)

1) JAWS- boat ride, no lap bar or restraint. Fairly easy to get in and out of.
2) Jurassic Park The Ride - lap bar that goes over everyone in the row. Also not bad, but definitely leave your bags in a locker for this one, it was a pain having to take it out from under the bar at the end of the ride with the bar‚Äôs large cushioning in the way.
3) Ice Gliders (Sliders? I forgot the name) - kid‚Äôs ride in Minion Land. This was a seatbelt mechanism, which worked for me. Do pull far out though as the seatbelt itself was hard to pull out.
4) Cupcake Spinners in the Hello Kitty area- no bar or constraint, easy for me to fit in. Similar to the Alice in Wonderland spinning teacups at Disney.
5) Mario Kart- sat in the back row (way more leg room) and had no issues. Worker discretely made sure lap bar was down far enough for everyone in vehicle, so it made me feel not as ousted. Seat IS quite small, so for anyone with a bigger bum or hips, try out the test seat!
6) Mine Cart Madness- bigger seat than Mario Kart but it does sink in deep, so again- bigger bums beware! Ride was fun, quite jolting! But no issue for fitting in. 

I didn‚Äôt attempt anything else, the park was busy and humid and I was too afraid to try testing out seats for other rides.",post,r/JapanTravel,Comedy,8.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/1krn62j/plus_size_at_usj/

Harry Potter forbidden Journey = Seats are relatively bigger than other thrill rides, restrain bar over the chest is a bit on the tight side. 


Harry Potter flight of the hippogriff = Children's min-coaster. I did fit though found the seat small & had little leg room. The worker wasn't happy with the fit even though the bars closed so I was asked to get off the ride. Avoid this one if you're plus sized, it turned out to be for kids anyway.

"15 Days. 1 Dream Trip to Japan. Itinerary Review Needed ‚Äì August Travel with My Wife! Hi, I and my wife would be travelling to Japan in Mid-August. I know not the best season for Japan, but this is when I am getting some holidays and breathing time before year end and always wanted to visit Japan so thought why not let's go.

  
Spent lot of time researching (at least I think of it) and have come down to below itinerary. We like to explore a lot and spend very less time in our hotel rooms. Reaching out to community to review it and provide your feedback and suggestions wherever you can. It would be highly appreciated. 

We will be landing on Haneda Airport on 16th Aug early morning and depart from Haneda on 31st. In total I have full 15 days in Japan. Below is my itinerary:

  
**Day 1 - Tokyo**

* Land early morning at Haneda Airport
* Meiji Jingu, Hie Shrine (Will try for both, if exhausting then maybe skip one)
* Shibuya Sky, Shibuya Scramble Crossing, Hachiko Statue ‚Äì All in one cluster.
* Nonbei Yokocho - For Dinner and Drinks



**Day 2 - Tokyo**

* Imperial Palace - Start early morning
* Art Aquarium (I think my wife would enjoy it)
* Hanazono Shrine (Maybe)
* Shinjuku Gyoen - Have a walk there. No cherry blossoms so not sure if even worth it.
* 3D Cat, Godzilla Head, Shinjuku Scramble - Evenings
* Find Good Place to Dinner and Drinks - Suggestions always welcome :)



**Day 3 - Tokyo**

* Sens≈ç-ji
* Tonkatsu lunch (Reservations/ Tickets/ Klook - Any other recommendation for experiencing some fun Sumo wrestling up close, and do they have vegan/vegetarian options for my wife?)
* Nezu Shrine,
* Yanaka Ginza - For Dinner and Drinks



**Day 4 - Tokyo**

* DisneySea 



**Day 5,6,7 and 8 (Something with nature/beach, island etc)(I can also decrease 1 day here and increase 1 in Osaka)**

Hakone, Kamakura and Mt Fuji (not able to plan the correct way yet like where to stay etc)

Any suggestion would be welcomed.

Also, if I decide on these 3 destinations, which is the better place to stay? 

Priority is always to see best of Japan (I know opinions can vary but love to hear thoughts from the community).



**Day 9 - Kyoto**

* Stay somewhere in Gion (Gran Bell Hotel/ Ryokan/ Sanjo)

Looking for review from the community and experienced travelers in Japan. And thank you for your time.

Also, one last thing I want to book tickets of almost everything (from shrines to Trains and From Entertainment Parks to Towers) in advance from Klook.

Okay was not aware of this. Will skip Art Aquarium.,comment_1,r/JapanTravel,Comedy,,https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/1krss5u/15_days_1_dream_trip_to_japan_itinerary_review/
"I'd advise against the Art Aquarium in favour of... literally any other aquarium.
The fish there are treated as sole display objects without places to hide, often with way too many animals in the tanks.
If you want illuminated fish, there's a light show at Kaiyukan as well and most of that aquarium is actually good.¬†


If possible, try to buy tickets from the websites (Disney, Team Lab, ...). Klook is an unnecessary middle man.
Train tickets you can also buy at the station.¬†


Are you a fan of theme parks or just going because they're often mentioned here? With only fifteen days I'd cut out one of them if it's for the latter reason.


Have you thought about going into the Alps instead of the coast? At least in September it was a lot better temperature wise in the mountains.",comment_2,r/JapanTravel,Comedy,,https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/1krss5u/15_days_1_dream_trip_to_japan_itinerary_review/

In Kyoto don't miss the Heian Shrine and Kinkaku-ji. Arashiyama has a lot more to offer than just the bamboo forest. In Nara, aside from the deer, you will find marvelous temples and shrines.

"Kyushu or Hokkaido in September? Hey everyone!

Me and a friend are booking our Japan trip from early September until the start of October. I've been several times before, so I've seen the Golden Triangle, so we're (mostly) going to some less traveled places. 

  
We're doing:

Fujikawaguchiko

Kanazawa (and seeing the surrounding areas like Shirakawago, etc)

Kamakura

  
But we're torn between spending a week, in either Kyushu or Hokkaido. We're both huge fans of culture and onsens, and with Beppu being the Onsen capital of Japan (or so I've heard), that sounds very attractive to us both. We're not hikers or mountain climbers, so Hokkaido is slightly less appealing to us.

However, I've read that the heat and humidity around this time is beyond brutal, especially in the southern regions. I'm from a subtropical climate, but I really don't function well in the heat and I'd be much more comfortable in a cooler place like Hokkaido.

If it were spring or late fall, I'd definitely be picking Kyushu. But with the heat being the factor that it is...the choices are less clear.

So. Based on all this, what would you suggest we pick? There are lots of good onsen places in Hokkaido? Would late September be cool \*enough\* for us to be able to do Kyushu without melting into a sweaty puddle within two minutes? 

Thanks a lot!",post,r/JapanTravel,Comedy,2.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/1krpvgg/kyushu_or_hokkaido_in_september/
"Weather in Japan has been relatively hard to predict in the recent years, so bear in mind that any prediction might turn out to be completely wrong. We have been to Japan four times in the past 12 months and weather was always different than the internet and predictions claimed it to be. 

We have been to Japan last year from mid September till early October, traveling from Tokyo to Fukushima and while it definitely was hot, it was bearable because the nights were around 20¬∞C. I heard from locals that two weeks prior it was still way worse though, so end of August/early September was the final week of the extreme summer heat. 

We aren't great with heat either, but having an umbrella, hats and cooling pads helped. Use common sense and don't stay out in the sun during noon with no protection on asphalt without any water. 

You should be fine late September/early October though, so how about planning the southern trip towards the end of your journey?",comment_1,r/JapanTravel,Comedy,,https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/1krpvgg/kyushu_or_hokkaido_in_september/

"I think it's doable and you've made some good choices. You're going to be very busy through. One thing I will caution on is that you really want to get out early in the am to beat the bus tours to Kyoto sights. We found that by 11am you could barely move at some places, especially the markets. Osaka was just always busy so you just have to go with it.

That being said we were pleasantly surprised by how quiet things were once you get away from the tour groups. There's lots to see just wandering through random neighborhoods and along the river walkway. Have fun.",comment_1,r/JapanTravel,Comedy,,https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/1krsqvn/8day_osakakyotouji_itinerary_check_second_trip_to/
"If you're looking to do n≈çry≈ç-yuka along the Kamo, I suggest you make a reservation ahead of time, and double check you are within the season that it is available. You can find some more info here ‚Üí [https://yuka-kyoto.com/](https://yuka-kyoto.com/)

Since your ≈åsaka days are fully booked, I'll only mention your Ky≈çto days. You could probably fit another location on Day 4 no problem, like Heian-jingu, or the KYOCERA art museum.

Uji is great, worth a whole day. If I could recommend that instead of leaving your luggage with the hotel it might be easier to take it to Ky≈çto station and leave it in a coin locker until you return. In Uji, By≈çd≈ç-in is fine, leaving via the south exit will allow you to reach the bridges to the small island in the river, and in the area are many good places for tea. Additionally the Uji Tea Museum has experiences for making matcha, and audio guided tours in various languages to learn about the town history and tea making in general.

Day 7 will be rough, there's a lot of queuing involved in Kinkaku-ji and Arashiyama bamboo forest as both are heavily touristed. Personally I would cut Kinkaku-ji entirely, I do not think it is worth it with the current crowding. In the area of Arashiyama, Saga Toriimoto preserved street and Adashino Nenbutsu-ji are far and away better. 

Otherwise a fine itinerary for hitting the most internationally famous locations.",comment_2,r/JapanTravel,Comedy,,https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/1krsqvn/8day_osakakyotouji_itinerary_check_second_trip_to/

"14 Day Itinerary: Osaka, Fukuoka, Tokyo **Background**

Headed to Japan for 14 days, only my wife and I. This will be our 3rd time going to Japan in the last 3 years so we have done and seen plenty. I wanted to watch baseball this trip and my wife surprisingly agreed to it, as long as she gets to shop.  We aren't doing Kyoto this time around and probably won't do the Osaka Expo. I thought it would be cool to see Hiroshima and Kamakura for day trips instead, to see some new things. I know the summers are hot so we are going to go at a slow pace and this is just an outline of what we are looking to see.

"A few comments:

* Staying at the Osaka Conrad but eating at cheap chain restaurants is unusual. If you're spending all your budget on hotels and skimping on food, there are some better options in the shopping complex in the basement area of the Conrad and the nearby Mitsui Garden Hotel Osaka Premier has a surprisingly good and well priced restaurant.
* For June 30, both Shinsaibashi and Amerikamura will be quiet in the morning - shopping areas in Japan don't really get going until around lunch.
* I don't understand why you're visiting Hiroshima as a day trip from Osaka when the Shinkansen to Fukuoka will pass through Hiroshima.
* Canal City is a faded mall that even Uniqlo has moved out of. The main shopping malls are attached to Hakata Station.
* July 5 isn't going to work: Dazaifu¬†needs most of a day and Nanzoin¬†takes up about half a day due to the awkward transport arrangements to get there and back.

"Itinerary for 28 days in Japan [Asking for recommendations, tips and advice] Hello! :)  
I am very excited for my trip to Japan, it will be my first solo trip (I know that 28 days seem like a lot, but I can handle it so this is not the topic)

The trip is scheduled between **19 SEP 2025 - 18 OCT 2025**, but I land in Japan on the 20th of September, so I am deducting a day (and also the return which is on the 18th of October 2025).

About the style of me/the trip I want:

\- I want to visit as much as I can without rushing or aching my legs, also I need to keep in mind that I probably will have a small suitcase and a large (20-23KG) suitcase for clothes and maybe stuff that I'll buy so I don't want to ""run"" around the streets of tokyo or anywhere in Japan with these heavy stuff too much.

\- I eat everything and not afraid to try new stuff (the plan is to visit about 3 Michelin star restaurants as well..) - I even want to! I have no problem religiously or allergies (only ear pain when flying lol but what can I do...)

\- I want to add that parties and nightlight in general don't really interest me as I have a partner, but it would be nice to check a party or two or the nightlife in Osaka which I heard is great.

I made a sheet with my ""Must - Visit"" and ""Nice to Have""

The must are: **Tokyo, Fuji (that is, around fuji somewhere) Kyoto and Osaka.**

That being said, when I say that I stay in Kyoto/Osaka - I don't mean that I'll stay only there, but just spend the night/sleep there, and do day-trips to all the known attractions like the deer park in Nara, maybe a quick jump to Kobe etc...

For Fuji - I thought about Hakone / Fujikawaguchiko, I may rent a car for that time in Fuji.

Tokyo - 6 days/5 nights, Fuji - 3 days/2 night, Kyoto - 5 days/4 nights Osaka 6 days/5 night

That leaves me with a lot of days to spend more in Japan, if someone can help me decide because I don't know for example, if I should do a ""long day trip"" from Osaka to Hiroshima (to see the place and the history about it) or literally stay nights there like I'll do in Tokyo/Kyoto etc..

I heard a lot of amazing places like Nikko, or stuff in the south like Fukuoka. Komamoto , but what places are worth to stay there 2-3 days and not just do day-trips to?

I am confused! if someone can help me, and also tell me what he thinks the optimal amount of days he thinks suits me/generally any first solo traveller to Japan that I should stay in each city.

Also I would be thankful if you could explain the best routes for each city, and which transportation best suits it (whether its a small ride on the bus/taxi or shinkansen or if I should get the JRPass etc..)

Thanks!!",post,r/JapanTravel,Comedy,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/1krjoy6/itinerary_for_28_days_in_japan_asking_for/
"Staying in the Big Three for that long is...wow. You would really have to want to do everything in just the cities. So I appreciate that you're looking for day trips/alternates. But to that I have to ask: what are you into? Why are you going to Japan?

If it's history, there are so many places especially around Lake Biwa, Nara, and outside Tokyo (Kamakura, Nikko) that would be worth visiting if they have sites specific to your interests. Basing out of Nagoya or Otsu would get you access to a lot of places, instead of Kyoto which is clogged with tourists. Now, don't get me wrong, Kyoto is lovely and has lots to see and do as well, but if you don't have specific sites you really want to see for yourself, don't waste time checking off someone else's to-do list. Do what YOU want to do. Would you rather visit the Odani ruins or temples along the Kumano Kodo than see Nijo-jo and Kiyomizu-dera? Then do it!

Are you into specific Japanese media, from tv shows to anime? Getting way off the beaten path will satisfy you, and a lot is still accessible by shinkansen and/or local trains. My next goal is to visit both Kurama and Hiei mountains in homage to one of my favorite animes, YuYu Hakusho, and then see the temple in Ichinomiya that was featured in the live action version. You can make entire itineraries following the ""real life"" locations of anything from Sailor Moon to Demon Slayer, or the filming locations of popular tv shows.

Is it food? There's so many options! You can taste fresh oysters from the by in Hiroshima/Miyajima, local-style ramen everywhere from Kumamoto to Hokkaido, gyutan in Sendai, specialty seafood all along the western, eastern, and northern coasts, you name it. Make yourself a foodie itinerary and go out of your way to have the best (whatever) Japan can offer!

Nature? Look up Japan's best sights, from waterfalls to sand dunes to national forests. Thrifting? Look up temple flea markets on the weekends. Cultural deep dives? Decide if you want to see live kabuki or noh theatre, local festivals, and traditional arts (sumo will not be happening during your time, unless it's a regional tour). High end luxury travel? Lots of youtubes have you covered. Spending tourist money to support earthquake victims? Noto may still have some travel issues but there are other regions, like Tohoku and Kyushu. And if you haven't thought of it yet, consider budgeting for a night's stay at an onsen or the very least a traditional ryokan for a genuine experience and a meal you won't forget.

You have all that time and a whole country, I'm jealous!!! I whirllwinded from Kumamoto to Sendai and back to try to get everything I really wanted in one trip, thinking I'd never get back. Now that I can afford to go back, I'm going to hit more historical places I missed the first time, but if that was my only trip I made sure to visit the sites that meant the most to me culturally, historically, and for excellent food. Love yourself, do what YOU want to do. If you want to spend 5 days thrifting your way around Osaka, go for it.",comment_1,r/JapanTravel,Comedy,,https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/1krjoy6/itinerary_for_28_days_in_japan_asking_for/
"I would plan where you want to go, then use a calculator to see if the JR pass or a combination of regional passes would be useful (just google JR pass calculator and you'll find one). The JR pass increased in price and isn't as obviously worth it anymore. You need to be riding the Shinkansen pretty much every day to make it worth it in my experience (which I've done before but it's pretty intense!)

With your travel style, I'd pick a couple of areas to ""hub"" in so you don't have to suffer from schlepping your luggage around too much, and maybe one or two special places like an onsen town. Here's some ideas:

\-Hub in Tokyo for a handful of days, then Shinkansen up to hub in Kanazawa for a bit. From Kanazawa you can day trip to Fukui and some other neat spots which are far less touristy and a nice change from Tokyo. If you have your hotel post your large luggage to your next spot, you can stop by Kusatsu Onsen on the way without dealing with lugging things on the bus. It's a bit more travel since the Shinkansen doesn't go there but it is my favorite onsen town. Two nights there is perfect!

\-After Kanazawa, head to the Kansai region and hub for a handful of days in either Osaka or Kyoto. It's only a 15 minute shinkansen ride between the two so you can just hunker down in one and see both. I'd be generous with the time here, since there's a lot you can see in both cities as well as fun day trips easily reachable from both. Day trips to Nara, Himeji castle, and Hiroshima/ Miyajima are plenty doable and don't need an overnight outside of the cities.

\-I'd pick either Shikoku or Kyushu as your final destination and pick a city there you want to see. Kyushu has Fukuoka or Nagasaki that would make good hubs, while Shikoku has more smaller towns but I've stayed in both Kochi and Matsuyama and found plenty to do. If you go for Nagasaki, I'd take a domestic flight to get back to Tokyo rather than the trains. If you go for Shikoku, you can plan your trip back up to Tokyo to stop by another neat town or two. 

\-If you don't want to deal with the extra transit time Shikoku/Kyushu would add, Nagoya is another neat hub spot. You can day trip around that area as well and it's on the way back to Tokyo.

  
Some general tips:

\-Plan some flexibility into your itinerary.  Sept/ early Oct is right in Typhoon season and I've had things cancelled/ train lines blocked because of storm damage. Keep an eye on the weather forecast.  
\-Look up holidays and know when they are; there's something called ""Sports Day"" on Oct 13th and I feel like the whole country was at Nikko when I went there having no idea it was a holiday. Pretty much everyone has a long weekend for that and tourist hotspots are PACKED. Hakone was also a nightmare that weekend but the very next day it was a ghost town lol. I'd maybe go somewhere a little less touristy that weekend if you can swing it.   
\-Nikko and Kamakura are neat day trips you can easily do from Tokyo  
\-Hakone or Fujikawaguchiko are nice areas for seeing Mt. Fuji; I'd stay two nights to have a full day in either spot. Some people do these as day trips from Tokyo and I think that's a bit much.  
\-If you can reduce your luggage you will have a better time. I managed 3 weeks in Japan on one carryon; lots of the budget hotels have laundry areas in the building, or you can find a laundromat to do laundry. Either do this or take heavy advantage of luggage delivery services because even just wrestling that carry on around trains and busses was a huge pain. You have to reserve special luggage spots on the shinkansen for the large size luggage.",comment_2,r/JapanTravel,Comedy,,https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/1krjoy6/itinerary_for_28_days_in_japan_asking_for/
"If you want to see what festivals are going on you can check japan guide.

Onsens are great after the end of a busy. I frequently walked too much while carrying too much during my first solo trip in Jan/Feb. I based myself in Hakone and my hostel had an onsen.

I just came back from 5 weeks in japan, and I'd say one thing I'd optimize next time is the amount of hotel/hostel changes I had, as lugging my suitcases through subways and train stations was fatiguing.

Shipping your luggage to your next hotel is a thing but I never tried it.

My strategy for food is to look at tablelog. 

For transportation if you really want to stretch your dollars use a night bus to travel between cities to save a night of accommodations. Willer Express busses let you bring 2 pieces of luggage and a backpack, while jam jam busses are only one piece I believe.",comment_3,r/JapanTravel,Comedy,,https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/1krjoy6/itinerary_for_28_days_in_japan_asking_for/
"I tried to go dirt cheap so I may not be the best source haha!

Ryokans were out of my budget range - I'm sure there's recommendations in this subreddit.

In general I'd say the toss up is between a ryokan near a bus stop, or one that might be farther away but has free parking to make a car rental more viable.

If a ryokan has restricted hours for an onsen, that might narrow your list - pretty sure ryokans with private onsens exist but of course the price will be higher.

Looking back on my first trip in Jan/Feb basing out of hakone was an insane decision because I was taking long train rides to do anime stuff, as it was an unplanned trip and even though I had 2-3 months to prepare it was my first time so I didn't know how to find close accommodations that were cheap.

>! I stayed at K's House Hakone for 3 nights - while they have dorm rooms, they also have a traditional Japanese room option. Their onsen is public though and in the basement. It closes at midnight for cleaning, and has an indoor and outdoor section that is segregated by gender but the locations alternate/switch the next day

"Definitely go on day trips to Nara and Himeiji Castle. 

A day trip to Hiroshima is possible, but you might want to make it an overnight trip to go to Miyajima as well. 

I recommend an overnight stay at a temple in Koyasan as well. You can stay somewhere in Osaka, then ask them to keep your suitcases overnight. Take a small bag with you for one night at Koyasan, then come back and stay at the same hotel in Osaka",comment_5,r/JapanTravel,Comedy,,https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/1krjoy6/itinerary_for_28_days_in_japan_asking_for/
"Itinerary Check We are adding a week onto a professional tour. The professional tour is 4 days in Tokyo and 3 days in Osaka. It ends June 28. Our flight leaves from NRT on July 5th. Here is what I'm thinking:

June 28 take train to Kyoto. KAYA Kyoto Nijo Castle, BW Signature Collection

June 29 Bike tour of Kyoto (whole or half day?)

June 29 Take Trains to Shimoda. Stay at Shimoda Yamatokan (1 night or 2 nights?).

June 30. Go surfing at if the waves are good. If waves are bad take walk along coast. Maybe hire a ride to go to ‚Äã‚ÄãKawazu Seven Waterfalls

(I need help deciding if I should stay two nights in Shimoda or if I should try to get an evening train to Tokyo on the 30th and have an extra day in Tokyo)

July 1. Take train to Tokyo. Stay at Hotel Graphy Nezu in Ueno 4 nights

I picked Uneo neighborhood because it is supposed to be quieter and my son wants to go to the zoo to see pandas. I need help finding a show to go see. My son would love to see an only-in-Tokyo flashy samurai performance. 

I'm not sure what else to do because I'm not sure what we will cover on the professional tour during the first week. It says we are doing one day where we ""explore Akihabara‚Äôs anime and tech scene, shop and stroll in Ginza"" and another day where we ""Visit Shibuya Crossing, Meiji Shrine, and Asakusa‚Äôs Senso-ji Temple"" so I don't need to repeat any of that. With the group we are staying at Centurion Hotel Grand Akasaka.

"Since your trains from Ky≈çto to Shimoda will take you over 4 hours, I'm here to implore you to spend 2 nights in Shimoda. It's quite a different and more peaceful location than many of the itineraries I see on here. In June you will be able to enjoy the Hydrangea festival in the Shimoda ajisai (hydrangea) garden, and afterwards the nearby floating aquarium which has quite unique dolphin shows. There is also a zoo not too far away in Izu Animal Kingdom.

Mount Nesugata is also accessible via cable car, which can be fun if you've never ridden one.

Additionally, Shimoda's main history of note is as the location of arrival for Admiral Perry's black ships at the ending of the Tokugawa Shogunate, ending over 200 years of Japan being a closed country, and facilitating the signing of the Treaty of Amity and Commerce between Japan and the USA.

And of course, 2 days increases your chances of a good surfing day. I promise I don't work for the Shimoda City Tourism board, I just love when people go to places that aren't the Golden Route.

"Trip report - Setouchi Triennale and Osaka Expo 2025 I recently came back from a 10 day trip, focusing on the Setouchi Triennale (Spring) and Osaka Expo. Sharing some tips and recs!

\---

**SETOUCHI TRIENNALE - TAKAMATSU, INUJIMA, OGIJIMA + MEGIJIMA, NAOSHIMA, SHODOSHIMA**

General tips:

1. The Setouchi Triennale passport (I bought this on the Triennale mobile app) is definitely worth buying if you‚Äôre planning to visit multiple islands. The passport covered majority of what we visited, except for the Chichu Art Museum and the Art House Minamidera on Naoshima, and Georges house on Shodoshima
2. Plan out which days each island‚Äôs artworks are closed and when you want to visit. The [congestion calendar](https://setouchi-artfest.jp/en/congestion-calendar/) is a neat summary for this.
3. Check the ferry timings beforehand!¬† Some ferries are not frequent (e.g. Takamatsu > Inujima only runs 3 times a day) and you will need to plan how much time you want to spend for each artwork on the island.
4. The 3 day ferry pass (I bought this on the Triennale app as well) is also great as you can skip the queues to buy tickets and go straight to the boarding queue

\-

**Takamatsu**

We stayed near the port, since we would be taking ferries out each morning for the next couple of days.

For our first day, we explored Takamatsu, visiting Yashima and Ritsurin Garden. We took the local kotoden train (you can use your IC Card) to Yashima station and got the shuttle bus up to Yashima observatory. There's a Triennale art installation here and the views and architecture of the observatory is gorgeous.

Lunch was at a lovely little restaurant on top of Yashima called [Ê°ÉÂ§™ÈÉéËå∂Â±ã](https://www.google.com/maps?sca_esv=19553afe85667678&rlz=1C5CHFA_enSG1102SG1102&output=search&q=%E6%A1%83%E5%A4%AA%E9%83%8E%E8%8C%B6%E5%B1%8B&source=lnms&fbs=ABzOT_CWdhQLP1FcmU5B0fn3xuWpIgVFCTcbZI9VMGzNoV0iOW2r2RmmbgIG0Wrb1wPZ_5-i69DzLMu7uGmOQP5JHEhAXAfGuAKMl0L0e454xtkMRIIhTr4YGHmnSt0cyffyFChbYocGKDny7RYHKvqkaCtg59ZebmVW5lbvnAYm9ju49VbKVCSaCq6-Gv4gT-qhszifZBMylhdfZEuUsf3-cJJMGSXyuA&entry=mc&ved=1t:200715&ictx=111). The Sanuki udon was the best we tried on our trip, and we also tried a regional speciality called Anmochi Zoni. This is mochi with red bean inside your miso udon soup.¬†

For dinner we headed to [Yoridorimidori](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Yoridorimidori/@34.3464542,134.0495656,17z/data=!4m15!1m8!3m7!1s0x3553eb859ee6fd17:0xbef678fbafd3e82d!2sYoridorimidori!8m2!3d34.3463491!4d134.0495438!10e5!16s%2Fg%2F1wk6xlgr!3m5!1s0x3553eb859ee6fd17:0xbef678fbafd3e82d!8m2!3d34.3463491!4d134.0495438!16s%2Fg%2F1wk6xlgr?entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI1MDUxNS4wIKXMDSoJLDEwMjExNDUzSAFQAw%3D%3D) to try another regional speciality: bone-in chicken.¬† They offer two types of chicken - young, and mature. We tried both, and WOW. The texture and taste of the mature chicken was rich and dense - if you told me the meat was steak or pork ribs I might believe you. I was skeptical about how chicken could possibly be any special and they proved me wrong.

\-

**Inujima**

* 0812 - 0902 Takamatsu port > Naoshima Miyanoura port
* 0920 - 1015 Naoshima Miyanoura port > Inujima port¬† (Not included in ferry pass)
* 1547 - 1639 Inujima port > Naoshima Miyanoura port (Not included in ferry pass)
* 1700 - 1800 Naoshima Miyanoura port > Takamatsu port

Inujima is relatively far from Takamatsu compared to the other islands but it's worth going! Inujima has the Inujima Art museum (which felt similar to Teshima Art museum in that the building is an experiential art installation rather than a museum) and a bunch of Art Houses.

Word of warning - If you are taking the same route we did, upon reaching Naoshima you should immediately head straight for the [Ticket counter for the Teshima/Inujima ferry](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Teshima+(Ieura)+and+Inujima+Ferry+Ticket+Kiosk/@34.4578082,133.9739658,20.61z/data=!4m15!1m8!3m7!1s0x3553f1b6b30575ed:0xae1f083eeb8571c5!2sNaoshima,+Kagawa+District,+Kagawa+761-3110,+Japan!3b1!8m2!3d34.4599166!4d133.9952438!16zL20vMDJoNjg3!3m5!1s0x3553ef001bbe7229:0x238d0623ff19e69c!8m2!3d34.45781!4d133.97425!16s%2Fg%2F11x6rfd977?entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI1MDUxNS4wIKXMDSoJLDEwMjExNDUzSAFQAw%3D%3D). This is a small little shack about 200m walk from where you disembark from the ferry. When we joined the queue, the staff started turning people behind us away as there were no more tickets available for the time¬† and the next one would be 3 hours later. As far as I know, you can't reserve tickets ahead either, you can only buy on the day and I believe ticket sales start only 30 minutes before departure. We were lucky just to make the cut off, although we had to stand as there weren't any seats left.

Half of those on board got off at Teshima, and again - when you reach Inujima, immediately buy your ticket for your trip back. Not sure if it will be different outside of the Triennale period, but there were triennale staff guiding everyone to first collect a queue number, then head to the actual information center to purchase your ferry ticket.

**Ogijima + Megijima**

* 0800 - 0840¬† Takamatsu > Ogijima
* 1300 - 1320 Ogijima > Megijima
* 1520 - 1540 Megijima > Takamatsu

We comfortably covered both in a day. There are more food options on Ogijima, so I definitely recommend getting lunch there before heading to Megijima. My favorite spot on Ogijima is the stairs near the Toyotama-hime Shrine, right next to [Áî∑Êú®Â≥∂„Éë„Éì„É™„Ç™„É≥](https://www.google.com/maps/place/%E7%94%B7%E6%9C%A8%E5%B3%B6%E3%83%91%E3%83%93%E3%83%AA%E3%82%AA%E3%83%B3/@34.4226533,134.0553581,19.39z/data=!4m6!3m5!1s0x3553f344caf7398b:0xbc852d4f25ed8673!8m2!3d34.4224185!4d134.0559372!16s%2Fg%2F11s65xnj1d?entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI1MDUxNS4wIKXMDSoJLDEwMjExNDUzSAFQAw%3D%3D). Gorgeous view of the town, the port and the big blue inland sea. There's quite a few stray cats around the island too but they all seemed disinterested in the tourists.

Megijima as a town, felt a lot more dead than Ogijima. Majority of the restaurants/ cafes were closed. I think everyone we saw were either tourists or Triennale staff. We skipped going to the cave because it was a hot day and we wanted to catch the earlier ferry back. My favorite art installation of the day was on Megijima though - don't miss [Â≥∂„ÅÆ‰∏≠„ÅÆÂ∞è„Åï„Å™„ÅäÂ∫ó„Éó„É≠„Ç∏„Çß„ÇØ„Éà](https://www.google.com/maps/place/%E3%80%8C%E5%B3%B6%E3%81%AE%E4%B8%AD%E3%81%AE%E5%B0%8F%E3%81%95%E3%81%AA%E3%81%8A%E5%BA%97%E3%80%8D%E3%83%97%E3%83%AD%E3%82%B8%E3%82%A7%E3%82%AF%E3%83%88/@34.3920253,134.0540169,21z/data=!4m6!3m5!1s0x3553ede1c8595859:0x65b5082a197bcda6!8m2!3d34.3920236!4d134.0540442!16s%2Fg%2F11h1m905_7?entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI1MDUxNS4wIKXMDSoJLDEwMjExNDUzSAFQAw%3D%3D).

**-**

**Naoshima**

* 0812 - 0902 Takamatsu > Naoshima Miyanoura port
* 1700 - 1800 Naoshima Miyanoura port > Takamatsu

I did this 2 years ago (not during the Triennale) but the rest of my group haven't so we went back! Honestly, Naoshima is a lot more enjoyable when the Triennale is not ongoing. It was so crowded compared to the first time I‚Äôd visited. The experience of Chichu Art Museum is best appreciated without hordes of chatty tourists rushing about. For maximum flexibility, rent an e-bike. Remember to reserve your e-bikes well ahead of time before your trip, if you are going during the Triennale period. They were all sold out on the day.

\-

**Shodoshima**

We got the ferry from Takamatsu to Shodoshima Tonosho port. It was really hard for me to find out which timings are the Slowpoke-branded ferries so for anyone else looking - I found this one: [https://www.shikokuferry.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/yadon.22.2.4.pdf](https://www.shikokuferry.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/yadon.22.2.4.pdf)

With 2 nights in Shodoshima, we rented a car from [Shodoshimaminato Car Rental](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Shodoshimaminato+Car+Rental/@34.4888124,134.166355,16z/data=!4m6!3m5!1s0x355389b660919cef:0x77702f9ff788f212!8m2!3d34.4888124!4d134.1753672!16s%2Fg%2F11t6v_mkls?entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI1MDUxNS4wIKXMDSoJLDEwMjExNDUzSAFQAw%3D%3D). It was the only one we found online that would rent to foreigners without a Japanese driving license. Get a International Driving Permit for this. I highly recommend them - the staff were exceedingly helpful and friendly, this was our first time driving in Japan and they made sure we were fully comfortable and even talked us through detailed itinerary recommendations for our 2 days and which roads to avoid (narrow/steep).

Grab a Shodoshima map from the information center before you head off. In a separate room there's a booth specific for Setouchi triennale and you can get a map of the art locations.

[Map of our driving route](https://imgur.com/qzqdQj5)

* Day 1 route (green): Tonosho > Senmaide/Nakayama rice fields > down the peninsula > Olive garden > Tonosho
* Day 2 route: Tonosho > Kusakabe port > Marukin soy sauce museum > Twenty four eyes movie village > Sakate port > Fukuda port > Angel Road > Tonosho

On Day 2, we skipped Kankakei Gorge since we wanted more time to catch the artworks, most of the indoor artworks close around 4.30pm.

**OSAKA EXPO 2025**

We reached Osaka in the afternoon and after checking in to our hotel near Honmachi station, impromptu decided to buy a Night ticket for the Expo!

Really glad we did this, we checked off more things off our list than we could have if we had only one day.¬†

We were going for breadth rather than depth, so our enjoyment of each pavilion is based more on how engaging  we found them overall rather than all the factoids. Turkmenistan is the exception here - ymmv but it was interesting to learn more about such a locked down country.  

*Favorites*¬†

* The grand ring - walk under and on the top, during day and night. It's gorgeous. Except for the flying bugs‚Ä¶
* Future of Life - snagged an on the day reservation
* Earth Mart - around 8pm we asked the staff if we could go in even though we didn't have a reservation and they let us in!
* Turkmenistan¬† - walk in¬†
* Kuwait - walk in

*Worth going if the queues aren't too long*

* commons pavilions A, B, C, D -¬† Please check out Commons B for Ukraine‚Äôs booth
* France - walk in
* Netherlands - this was the only one we got from the lottery
* Singapore¬† - walk-in
* China - walk in
* UAE - walk in
* Malaysia - walk in
* Spain - walk in

*‚Ä¶Ehh‚Ä¶*

* Oman - walk in
* Colombia - walk in
* Commons E¬† - walk in
* Commons F¬† - walk in
* Earth at night¬† - walk in

Tip: for females - I saw long queues for the standalone toilets with fancy architecture even though there were empty toilets in the buildings a short walk away. Check a map and head to the toilets inside the shop/restaurant buildings, they were always emptier.

I'd also recommend that after you hit some of your must see pavilions, just take some time to wander around and relax. There's a lot of performances ongoing throughout the day, don't get stressed out queuing for hours for everything!

On our last day, we had some time to kill in Osaka before our evening flight out. It was an enjoyable walk down from Honmachi to Shinsaibashi station, exploring the Amemura area. A cute surprise was the Big Step shopping mall, it has quirky illustrations all over the building and don't miss the B1 and B2 toilets (the male one seems cooler).",post,r/JapanTravel,Comedy,25.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/1kqx4rn/trip_report_setouchi_triennale_and_osaka_expo_2025/

It's super cloudy now with some rain so I guess Yashima wouldn't be worth it. We did Ritsurin Garden today and it was nice even without blue skies. We got young bone-in chicken tonight at Ranmaru and it was super juicy and delicious. They ran out of mature chicken.

"November Tokyo itinerary check My family and I are planning a trip to Tokyo in late November 2025 and would love some feedback on our itinerary. We have a rough plan sketched out, and would appreciate any suggestions or recommendations you might have.

We are a family with two kids, ages 9 and 7, traveling to Tokyo after a 5-day trip to Taiwan. The jet lag hopefully will be mostly gone by the time we are in Tokyo.

Considering the kids' ages, we're likely to skip or limit our time in Shinjuku. We visit disney world every year so the kids are capable of walking 30k steps daily. However walking in Tokyo will be different with less frequent seated breaks. Is the scheduling too rushed or too relaxed? Are there any other recommended activities in Fujikawaguchiko that we should consider?",post,r/JapanTravel,Comedy,0.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/1krhzdm/november_tokyo_itinerary_check/
"A few suggestions:

* Disneyland is not in a central location so it's not a good base for your tip. I would suggest staying there for a few nights when you want to go to Disneyland and then changing hotels to somewhere more central.
* Try and include Akihabara the same day as Asakusa and Ueno as they are all in the same area. Akihabara is more interesting in the late afternoon and evening. 
* The steps can be the hard part if not used to it as like you said seating during the day can be limited (unless you go to cafes/restaurants etc).",comment_1,r/JapanTravel,Comedy,,https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/1krhzdm/november_tokyo_itinerary_check/
"Your 11/23 days sounds really long, is it a private tour the whole way to Yokohama? Also be aware that in November, you are likely to be unable to see Fuji from many famous locations, due to weather. For scramble crossing I would recommend you go to a nearby viewing platform or Starbucks on an upper floor to view, rather than getting in the way of people commuting on the ground level.

Also I should note that Golden Gai is a street for bars, and there isn't anything there for children, nor will they be allowed inside. Ginza is mainly large brand shops, which maybe isn't very interesting for children either, but you do seem to have listed a lot of shopping for your trip.

Additionally, please skip your ""Quick Lawson trip"", recently this has caused a lot of trouble for residents due to crowded on the street and people stepping in to the road, and recently they erected a barrier to block the view. In November the chances are low of getting a good picture, and at best it's the same picture everyone else has.",comment_2,r/JapanTravel,Comedy,,https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/1krhzdm/november_tokyo_itinerary_check/
"I've searched hotels to fit us around Asakusa and Ueno, they are just slightly cheaper than the Disneyland resorts. I am a Disney adult and love the theming and decors so I'm ok with the location being a bit far from the city center. \
Ok I was debating doing all Asakusa/Ueno/Akihabara in the same day. We'll try to squeeze the itinerary and fit the Akihabara in the afternoon/evening.",comment_3,r/JapanTravel,Comedy,,https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/1krhzdm/november_tokyo_itinerary_check/

"So, in reality, this trip only has 5 full days in Japan and you're taking up 40% of those with Disney. Actually, it's going to be an even higher percentage, because the area you're staying in looks to be a complete pain in the ass to get anywhere. It looks like you'll need to take whatever Disney shuttle or taxi to Maihama station, followed up by multiple trains/at least one transfer to get to almost every place on your list. So, practically every day - other than those Disney days - will involve at least 2+ hours train travel round trip.

As the other poster noted - different strokes and all that - maybe you guys are true Disney freaks, but I don't think you guys will be seeing much of Tokyo at all on this itinerary, beyond a very superficial level.",comment_1,r/JapanTravel,Comedy,,https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/1kr6dm0/itinerary_check/
"TBH for such a short time in Tokyo, I would recommend just going to Disney Sea, because that's a Japan-only experience.     However, that's just my personal thoughts, if you have Disney crazy family, your priorities might be different.  

There's nothing out of line with this itinerary - everything is grouped in the same areas for the days you picked, so relatively practical.    Is this your first trip to Japan?  Do you plan on coming back?",comment_2,r/JapanTravel,Comedy,,https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/1kr6dm0/itinerary_check/
"Looking in from the outside, similar trip planned. What hotel would you recommend to be more central than OP‚Äôs stay?",comment_3,r/JapanTravel,Comedy,,https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/1kr6dm0/itinerary_check/
"I don't have any particular hotel recommendations, but there are a ton of neighborhoods significantly more central/convenient/actually feel like Tokyo than Tokyo Bay/Odaiba. It's well trodden territory. Shinjuku, Shibuya, Ueno, Akasaka, Ebisu, Ikebukuro, Jimbocho, Nakano, on and on.

My wife and I have stayed in a bunch of neighborhoods - Jimbocho, Ebisu, Kanda, Nishi-Shinjuku, Koenji, Shin-Okubo, Shinagawa, Shinjuku, Yutenji. As long as you're within 5-10 minutes of a train station, the rest is up to what you're looking for out of a neighborhood. Koenji is where we always try to stay now, as it has become a home away from home for us.",comment_4,r/JapanTravel,Comedy,,https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/1kr6dm0/itinerary_check/
"Trip Report - April 26 - May 5 TL;DR

1. My trip was primarily Sakura:
   1. Fly into Tokyo
   2. Car Rental Trip (Tokyo > Zao > Morioka > Semboku > Tsuchiura > Tokyo)
   3. Back home
2. Less crowd outside Tokyo but Crowded in Tokyo (Harajuku , Shinjuku , Ginza)
3. Most drive via Expressway, following car GPS (ETC2.0)
4. Manage to see Yoshino Sakura and Weeping Willow Sakura

**Day 0 -** April 26

We arrived at the airport early because I had to park my car at a different house before taking a GRAB SUV to Suvarnabhumi. Flying ANA was pleasant; they efficiently organized boarding into separate lines before we boarded. A delightful surprise was the cute Pokemon-themed take-off and landing video.

So the flight was generally fine, the meal was acceptable, though the sake might have caused a bit of in-flight queasiness. But the real disappointment was the missing ice cream at the end.

Arrived Haneda Airport around before 11pm, immigration and custom clearance was quick and efficient. Tho you need to prepare QR code using VJW. Checked-in Hotel Villa Fontaine Grand Haneda Airport for the night, few mins walk from Arrival hall to Hotel within the Terminal.

**Day 1** \- April 27

Our first day began with a quick and efficient van pickup from Nissan Rent-a-Car. Their shuttle whisked our group of five and our luggage from the Arrival Hall to their nearby outlet. Paperwork was swift, taking only five minutes, and after a quick car check, we were on our way by 11 AM, heading towards Za≈ç, Katta District, Miyagi.

Upon reaching the Za≈ç area after 3 PM, we opted for the [Zao Echo Line](https://maps.app.goo.gl/WZUtv22sgYWfkuEeA) due to its proximity to our accommodations, [Sora - Zao Sansuien and Gaiariz Resort](https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/1080878570505895401?guests=1&adults=1&s=67&unique_share_id=4ba5805e-67db-4bc2-ae87-bc645b04377e) (Upon check in we we're given 1000yen coupon each for meals in nearby restaurants). This proved to be an excellent choice; the towering snow walls and icy mountain vistas were breathtaking. Despite the 5-7¬∞C temperature, a brisk breeze made it feel quite cold.

[https://ibb.co/mrRJdfM8](https://ibb.co/mrRJdfM8)

After an hour of exploring, we headed back near our accommodation for a simple yet delicious dinner at [Yamaboushi](https://maps.app.goo.gl/kvHCCJodkD3ttxHA8) , conveniently located next to a **Family Mart**. The language barrier was easily overcome using iOS to translate the menu, and even better, our Airbnb provided a 1000 yen per person discount voucher, bringing the total for our five-meal set to just 9000 yen. We then grabbed some snacks and drinks from Family Mart before returning to our accommodation for a relaxing **hot spring onsen** to end our first day.

**Day 1** \- April 28

We left around 8 AM for Morioka, Iwate. We made a quick stop at [Kitakami Tenshochi Park](https://maps.app.goo.gl/C3HpXkbk6zykV1Qu5) hoping to see some Sakura trees, but decided to press on to Morioka as there weren't any left along the road.

For lunch, we tried[ mass sakeo yobu shokutaku](https://maps.app.goo.gl/cXZ8Hf2zpDWRkJ1s9). The food was unique, with a slight Thai influence. Afterward, we explored [Morioka-jo Castle Site Park (Iwate Park)](https://maps.app.goo.gl/b4heCAqDJg4Voedy7). While the park itself didn't have many cherry blossoms left, we found a few beautiful weeping cherry trees in front of the shrine. [https://ibb.co/KcJMprTD](https://ibb.co/KcJMprTD) [https://ibb.co/d0BB1XNL](https://ibb.co/d0BB1XNL)  
[Kaiun Bridge](https://maps.app.goo.gl/FWBiNMQDBLBG2AWB6) good location to take Iwate mount pic - [https://ibb.co/1tQnFHfT](https://ibb.co/1tQnFHfT)  
Our next stop was [Shizukuishigawa Park Èõ´Áü≥Â∑ùÂúíÂú∞](https://maps.app.goo.gl/nZY2q5Je2x2G8H85A) , which had 150 **Yoshino Cherry Trees** and wasn't crowded. This spot perfectly met our objective, and we spent about two hours there. [https://ibb.co/XgC0M9T](https://ibb.co/XgC0M9T)  [https://ibb.co/398PsVvM](https://ibb.co/398PsVvM)

We then continued to Semboku, Akita, to our Airbnb, [Farm To Table NORICHIE(„Éï„Ç°„Éº„É†„Éà„Ç•„Éº„ÉÜ„Éº„Éñ„É´ „Éé„É™„ÉÅ„Ç®)](https://maps.app.goo.gl/PqEqV1CfChDGJd296) . We highly recommend this place if you're in the region. The villa is new, and dinner and breakfast are included. The hosts are a very kind and friendly couple, and they use ingredients from their own farm, located right next door. [https://ibb.co/j9YvcC8K](https://ibb.co/j9YvcC8K)

**Day 2** \- April 29

Our day began with a delicious, Akita-inspired breakfast prepared by our host. Afterward, we drove to Samurai Street in Kakunodate, parking for ¬•500 next to [Hinokinaigawa Tsutsumi Park](https://maps.app.goo.gl/9F9nAbcNPz4fENM17).Unfortunately, a light drizzle and wind meant the **cherry blossoms (**[Hinokinai-gawa River Yoshino cherry trees](https://maps.app.goo.gl/db1tW7EGAmR9h3MG7) and [Kakunodate no Shidare-zakura (cherry trees with drooping branches)](https://maps.app.goo.gl/d5mCnFQn4No3eTan9) ) were largely gone, either past their prime or blown away. Still, exploring the samurai houses was interesting, with some offering free entry and others a paid experience. We ended our visit with a delightful stop at [Michinoku Akita Pudding Shop](https://maps.app.goo.gl/d5mCnFQn4No3eTan9) , where a small queue was forming for their tasty pudding. [https://ibb.co/cK0bfFhn](https://ibb.co/cK0bfFhn) [https://ibb.co/Mkk1ghQ2](https://ibb.co/Mkk1ghQ2)

Next, we headed to [Lake Tazawa](https://maps.app.goo.gl/2dV65uWnfYkuYDMb7), for lunch at [Â±±„ÅÆ„ÅØ„Å°„Åø„Å§Â±ã„Äé„Éî„Ç∂Â∑•Êàø„Äè](https://maps.app.goo.gl/UAc6xG2ZvmKnujP69),Their pizzas were fantastic, especially the **Honey Pork Pizza**, which came with an extra tube of honey for those who wanted more. Adjacent to the restaurant was the [Yama no hachimitsuya](https://maps.app.goo.gl/VNANGXvkCYwB1vAp6) shop, perfect for picking up edible souvenirs like honey-infused sauces and drinks. The rain continued, so we opted for a scenic drive around the lake without stopping before heading back to our accommodation. Our hosts thoughtfully lit the fireplace, a cozy touch given the 7-9¬∞C weather, and likely its last use until next winter. We concluded our day with a heartfelt dinner, accompanied by two bottles of sake and fascinating insights into the **Akita region's lifestyle**.

**Day 3** \- April 30

Our Airbnb owner provided breakfast and saw us off in the traditional Japanese way, standing and waving goodbye until we were 300-400 meters away ‚Äì truly a memorable gesture. For this leg of our trip, we drove to Tsuchiura, Ibaraki, primarily as a base for visiting Hitachi Seaside Park. Accommodation options closer to the park were limited, making Tsuchiura the most convenient choice. The town itself doesn't offer many attractions, so we opted for a simple meal near the JR Station and rested after the long drive at [Airbnb Sky House Tsuchiura](https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/972017314092079842?guests=1&adults=1&s=67&unique_share_id=5232922e-8067-403a-b0d7-609d4efe1f3a)

**Day 4** \- April 31

Reading Facebook and site reviews for Hitachi Seaside Park revealed it was very overcrowded, so we decided to skip it. Instead, we drove to [Little Edo Sawara boat tour](https://maps.app.goo.gl/K3P8kJmDoFCbEVg1A) , enjoyed a **morning boat tour**, and then explored on foot for an hour. Our next stop was [Ami Premium Outlets](https://maps.app.goo.gl/x9DxenaejsK1RLvQ8) ,for two hours, where prices were significantly cheaper than in our home country. Finally, we headed to [Aeon Mall Tsukuba](https://maps.app.goo.gl/YQYsRfPtqibGaQCR8) for a late lunch and picked up some groceries from the supermarket to cook and reheat at our Airbnb.

**Day 5 - 8** \- May 1 to May 4

Final day with car, drove to [Mitsui Outlet Park Kisarazu](https://maps.app.goo.gl/h7omVTyfVmzuDhTB8) for Final shopping then repack and drop in Airport Luggage locker + return the car. While driving to Haneda Airport, the tollways is insane to be honest but is an experience driving on the bridge and tunnel there. Took Subway to Higashi-ginza Sta. but raining so had to get Go cab to [Airbnb Dash Living Tsukiji](https://maps.app.goo.gl/PfEsJ69DapazyxYQ8), simple Family Mart meal & wine rest for the day.

Next 2 morning nothing to shout about, just Tsukiji market for food, most of the stuff are delicious, but we aim to get Match Powder as much as we can. There is about 3-4 stalls selling them with limit 1 per person. Even 1 of the shop in Mitsukoshi Mall nearby doesn't have stock, obviously only for famous brand. I recommend this sukiyaki [ÁØâÂú∞ „Åô„Åç„ÇÑ„Åç„ÅÆËã•Êùæ](https://maps.app.goo.gl/XodMYuFW2cFucw3E6) , one of best I ever had and the waiter is very friendly to foreigner.  
Nothing much to share in Tokyo since generally people go for Flagship store to get their stuff.  
Took flight back at 1am, Haneda T2 is quiet after 10pm/11pm.",post,r/JapanTravel,Comedy,3.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/1kqxvg4/trip_report_april_26_may_5/

"16 Day Travel Itinerary (November 2025) Hello! I need help deciding if I'm doing too much in my trip. I'll be travelling with 2 of my friends to Japan from 3rd to 19th November (including the days on a flight). I've included all the places I want to go and as I write this I'm sure I won't be able to cover all of these places everyday but I've added places which are kinda close to each other so that it's easier to reach them from one point to the other. Keyword being *KINDA* lmao. 

My interests: Museums, gardens/temples, walks with a view of the sea, cafes and food!. My friends and I won't necessarily be together all the time as our interests vary.

"11/4, next to Chinatown is the Motomachi area, with many shops and restaurants. There are also 19th-century style buildings in the area, from when the area was an international port with outside countries having an increased presence.



11/5, for Kamakura, consider also seseing the more serene Kita Kamakura area one station away. It has temples, shrine, and a lot of greenery. One of my favorite spots is Meigetsuin. Don't miss out on the garden in the back. (Has an optional entrance fee.)



 11/7, this might not be your thing but since you have a car, you can also go to Motosuko Lake and see the spot from the picture on the back of the 1000 yen note (previous version but still in circulation). Kinda neat.

"This itinerary looks... brutal. 

I was reading day 3. In the morning, you're going to a museum. Sounds good. Then, to a park. OK. Get lunch, OK. Back to another museum. Then shopping. Sounds like a pretty full day! I kept scrolling and thought, ""Oh, there's more."" Then go to Tokyo dome. Then go to the imperial palace. Then also go explore Shibuya. That sounds like way too much.

It might help you to look into how much time to spend at each place. For example, you'll probably spend about 2 hours at each of the museums you picked. Tokyo Dome is another 2 hours. For those 3 activities, you're looking at 6 hours plus travel time. That's a full day, but you have a lot more on your list. They recommend 2-3 hours at the Imperial Palace. So, you're looking at 8-9 hours, plus time to travel and eat. So you're probably at an 10-11 hour day and that doesn't even include the shopping you want to do or Shibuya. I think you're looking at possibly a 16 hour day. If all of your days in Tokyo are 16 hour days, you're going to be miserable. 

I get that there is a lot you want to see and do. Something you can do is create a list of possibilities and choices for the day of (note: this only works if you don't need reservations).",comment_4,r/JapanTravel,Comedy,,https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/1kqemus/6_days_in_tokyo_itinerary_check_and/

"Initial Itinerary Check - First 5 Days in Japan (October 2025 - Trip 4) My husband and I are in our mid/late 30s and embarking on our 4th trip to Japan in mid/late October until the early Nov (22 days in total in Japan - excluding travel in/out day). Looking for some feedback and advice on some of my questions regarding the first 5 days as this is potentially what will influence the tentative plan for what we do with the remaining days that follow (we're spending most in Tohoku before finishing with a few days in Tokyo).

(*For context - we're relatively fast pace in our travel. We like to have a rough plan but we aren't afraid to change days/mix things up as needed and ad hoc change our minds. We don't normally plan by the hour and nothing is usually set in stone for us, but found Nakasendo likely needed extra caution due to sunset time in late October. All timings after these 5 days will likely be much more fluid with a lot less moving around with any high frequency.*)

Any feedback or points of concern, please flag but I *think* I should be more or less on the right track.... Just need a sanity check that I haven't missed something glaringly obvious or have given way too much/not enough time somewhere ). Apologies in advance for the length (I know it's chonky). **DISNEY IS UNLIKELY** (just before I get any comments fixating on that option and literally nothing else). I've added it for my own brain and I am aware how exhausted we are likely to be and how chaotic this day is likely to be. Option 2 is what we're 95% more likely to go with.

# Day 1 (Fri, 17th of Oct) - Land at Tokyo HND @ 7:15 / Finish in Nagoya

* **7:15 - 10:30ish**: (\~2-3 hours) Deplane, go through Customs & Immigration, get bags, etc. (hopefully will be a lot quicker though).
* **Option 1** Spend the day at DisneySea to get over jetlag (***WILL BE PLAYING THIS BY EAR - AND VERY UNLIKELY WE'LL DO IT***). Going to leave it a bit up to fate to see how quickly we get through and get our bags, how we're feeling, and - most importantly - if there are any tickets available. If we aren't up to it, than it doesn't matter as it's a ""no"" regardless. We will either be storing our bags or forwarding them on (ideally to where we end on Day 5) or storing them in a locker for the day. Rough Plan (if tickets are still available on the day) would look as follows (but obviously times are just guestimates):
   * **10:50 - 11:37ish**: Limo Bus departure from International Terminal at Haneda --> arrival at DsineySea.
   * **11:37 - 12:30ish**: Queue to get into Disney (planning \~1 hour but assuming this late in the day would likely take less time to get in the park)
   * **12:30 - 19:30ish**: Walk around the park/eat all the thematic food. Interested mostly on just eating the food and any rides that have low wait times. There is nothing I'm really mad about going on and if I only get on 1 or 2 rides, but I get a bunch of fun and tasty food, fresh air, and thematic scenery, I'm good with that. **Caveat based on feedback previously given to my proposed plan: We aren't Disney adults. We care about what rides we get on/don't get on. There are none we specifically care about. I didn't even know about Fantasy Springs until researching for this trip (so - no - I don't care if I don't get in). I want to go mainly  to eat all the thematic food at the food carts/fast food spots (not interested in proper pre-book restaurants) and keeping myself stimulated/awake. I also bumped it from all3 previous trips so it's sort of a matter of principle now. I know how my body handles this type of trip having done it several times before (we will leave earlier - or later - if we need to/want to). Yes, it's an expensive way to just walk around, eat, get fresh air, and get on a handful of rides at best. Yes I know we're starting quite late in the morning (which isn't recommended) AND this is a really chaotic/long first day so we will be exhausted and may not even be able to stay this long at the park, so may not be worth the money).**
   * **20:00 - 22:23ish**: Take the Shinkansen from Tokyo DisneySea --> Nagoya Station. (other option is to stay in Tokyo for the night by the train and leave for Nagoya early the next morning, but I'm not as keen, I'd rather skip Disney).
   * **22:30ish**: Check-in/go to bed.
* **OPTION 2 (much more likely)** Go straight to Nagoya
   * **11:02 - 13:09**: Travel from Haneda International Terminal --> Nagoya station (ideally we have enough time post getting bags/sending bags to grab a coffee and something quick to eat on the train)
   * **13:09 - ?**: No accommodation booked yet so not sure on check-in time. If it's too early, and we haven't had food yet, we'll go find something. Probably get another coffee at this point. Basically play it by ear and explore, enough to stay awake but not anything that needs a lot of brain power. Maybe grab a cheeky beer (depending on how we're feeling) and dinner at some point - maybe just take away to eat in our accommodation.
   * Early(ish) to bed.

# Day 2 (Sat, 18th of Oct) - Start/Finish Nagoya

Depending on the day before, just explore Nagoya. Nothing we're passionate about/sad to miss so we'll see as much as we can see (if we are feeling good and got there early the day before/saw everything we cared about, will consider a day trip somewhere). Reason for coming here was that it was quick/easy enough from Tokyo and seemed to be a good hub that would give us options depending on how we were feeling.

Husband wants to go to some of the Toyota Museums and I've noted down some other museums/shrines that we can do, but overall plan is to just take it a bit slower and settle in. Might end up with a later morning. Contemplating as well maybe booking in Ghibli park (on the fence with this one as I'm more of the Ghibli fan but my husband enjoys it and doesn't mind - he did like the Museum in Tokyo when we went years ago).

Whatever we do, we want to get a relatively early night so that hopefully by Day 3, we should be back on a manageable sleep cycle (we're normally fine by Day 3).

# Day 3 (Sun, 19th of Oct) - Start Nagoya / Finish Nakatsugawa

* **8:30 - 11:00ish**: Be ready by this time and leaving accommodation (ideally bags will have already been sent to our Day 5 end point, but if not we'll do this first thing from the station as we'll need to go that way anyways). Grab a coffee (maybe something quick to eat - we love coffee, but aren't big breakfast people) and finish anything in Nagoya we missed that we have time for.
* **11:30 - 12:25**: Train from Nagoya --> Sekigahara (may take earlier/later one, but this was just for rough planning sake).
* **12:30 - 16:30**: Light lunch/explore Seki battlefield/museum (finding mixed reviews on how long it takes, so planned \~4 hours. Would hope arrive sooner and finish sooner though).
* **16:51 - 19:04**: Train from Seki --> Nakatsugawa (picked the one that seemed the best fit on a Sunday, but again, may be done earlier or later). First stop will be to check into our hotel (we're booked less than 10 mins walk from the train). I'm assuming so many things will be closed, but if we arrive early enough, we'll explore what we can (we don't have anything that's really a ""must""), have some dinner, and maybe get a quick drink in.
* Looking to finish relatively early as the next 2 days will be lots of walking/early starts.

# Day 4 (Mon, 20th of Oct) - Start Nakatsugawa / Finish Kiso-Fukushima

* **8:00-8:30ish**: Plan to be up/out by this point. There's a really good coffee place near our accommodation that opens at 8, so will grab coffee and maybe a quick bite, then head out for our day of walking the Nakasendo.
* **8:30 - 11:00ish**: Walk Nakatsugawa --> Magome-juku (via Ochiai-Juku). Rounded up the walk time to allow for slowing down/taking photos/etc.(est according to google was just over 2 hours). I also have the bus noted down as well from Nakatsugawa station --> Ochiai should we want to cut that part of the walk out (which may result in earlier arrival in Magome).
* **11:00 - 12:30ish**: Explore Magome/eat
* 1**2:30 - 15:30ish**: Walk to Tsumago-juku (google maps says \~2 hours walk but feedback seems to vary. Been told 3 hours if VERY slow, so have used this for a worst case scenario).
* **15:30 - 16:30ish**: Explore Tsumago
* **Option 1 (Time Dependent)** Walk to Nagiso (\~1 hour from Tsumago-juku --> Nagiso Station). I know sunset starts at around 16:45 at this time of year, so we will only do this if we do manage finish in Tsumago sooner (as I suspect we might as I've rounded everything up and then some), we aren't looking to risk it.
* **Option 2** Bus from Tsumago --> Nagiso - the last 2 buses leave at 16:14 & 17:41, so the latest we'd arrive in Nagiso would be 17:50 (not looking to take a cab).
* **17:50 - 20:30ish**: Explore Nagiso (or what we can - as imagine most is closed if we get there at the latest timing possible) and get some food if we're feeling hungry. Alternatively, grab some food to eat at our accommodation (as I think we'll likely miss the Kaiseki - which I'm okay with as I don't love that anyways - it's not my bag). I don't have a lot of things on my ""Nagiso must see"" list to be fair, so it's more about completing it than getting there in time before something closes (unless I'm missing anything particularly cool?).
* **20:43 - 21:25**: Train from Nagiso --> Kiso-Fukishima + Walk to hotel ([Kiso Mikawaya](https://kiso-mikawaya.com/) is what we booked, but we are going to keep eyes peeled when we get close to 3 months out). We could also realistically get the 21:49, but that feels wayyyy too late and I can't imagine needing more than 3 hours in Nagiso (I will likely be cooked). There are also earlier options, I was just planning for the latest option we'd want to go with.

# Day 5 (Tues, 21st of Oct) - Start Kiso-Fukishima / Finish Matsumoto

* **8:00ish**:  Wake up and get out by this time
* **8:00 - 11:00ish**: Explore KF. Genuinely have no idea how much time is needed, this was a guess. I don't have much on my list as of yet, so potentially just a few hours to walk around will be fine. I want to try to make sure we get the 11:03 train if possible so we waste more time as the next one isn't until 13:03 (and I think that would be overkill).
* **11:03 - 11:19ish**: Train from KF --> Yabuhara)
* **11:19 - 13:00ish**: Walk From Yubahara --> Narai-Juku (google says it's just under 1.5 hours, but I've rounded up to allow stops/slower pace)
* **13:00 - 17:00ish**: Eat lunch in Narai and explore the area. Giving \~4 hours as I'm finding such varied results on how much time typically people spend (some say as little as 2 and some say a whole day..). I have a few landmarks noted, but unsure if they are things I'll naturally see as part of the walking.
* ***OPTIONAL STOP*** \- If we're ahead of schedule or it feels like we can manage it, we will look to stop in Shiojiri for some Sake (and maybe food) before ending the day in Matsumoto. It looks like it's an easy enough detour on the way as we could take a 16:57 departing train, arriving at 17:37 in Shiojiri (in perfect time for food and drinks if we don't manage to get there earlier).
* **16:57 - 17:47**: If we don't stop in Shiojiri, we will travel to straight to Matsumoto to check into our hotel for the next few days where our bags will hopefully be waiting for us (no more Nakasendo walking from this point). The train is the same one that goes to Shiojiri so we can play it by ear (and the last train from Shiojiri --> Matsumoto is well after 23:00 with seemingly frequent enough connections).

**FROM HERE - WE SPEND DAYS IN MATSMOTO AND CONTINUE ON TO TOHOKU....**

**QUESTIONS**:

* On Day 3 -
   * Are there any things in Nakatsugawa that are considered MUST SEEs that I shouldn't miss out on? I honestly didn't have a lot, it was just a good base from what I could tell to start the day, but unsure if I've overlooked something massively.
   * Realistically, will 4 hours for lunch and the battlefield/museum in Seki be enough/too much? I've gotten quite mixed reviews from blogs I've found (some say you need to spend the whole day, others say if you aren't a massive history buff it's not even worth going).
* Day 2/Day 3-
   * Does it make more sense on Day 2 (fully day/overnight in Nagoya) to spend AM in Seki, PM in Nagoya then on Day 3, spend slightly longer in Nagoya for anything we really don't want to miss (if we missed opening times for example) before going straight to Nakatsugawa on Day 3? Asking as it seems that could work out more efficient as Nagoya --> Seki is under 1 hour and Nagoya --> Nakatsugawa is \~1 hour (give or take a bit), but Seki --> Nakatsugawa is over 2 hours, so may not be the best use of time (and will give us less time to explore Nakatsugawa). Thoughts?
* Day 4 -
   * we currently finish in Kiso-Fukushima **but** that accommodation is fully refundable until October. I weighed up different ""finish"" locations for the day (Nagiso, Nojiri, KF, Narai, and Matsumoto), but it all ends up being a ""much of a muchness""  RE impact on Day 5 due to limitations with the train timings from KF --> Yabuhara (the key times train departs are 11:03, 13:03, or after 15:00). I went with KF as it gives us the chance to start early on Day 5, making it more realistic that we'll make the 11:03 train, meaning we could potentially get more out of our Day 5, but the close second was Matsumoto as this is where we will be finishing Day 5, so if we also stay on Day 4 it would just become a loop day (and we'd not need to bring anything with us for the walk at all). Any thoughts, advice, recommendations??
* Day 5 -
   * Am I massively underestimating how much time I need in KF? It can be hard to find info as all searches tend to lead back either to Fukushima prefecture or to the Kiso-Valley as a whole.
   * Has anybody else successfully managed to fit KF --> Yabuhara --> Narai --> Shiojiri into 1 day? Is that just packing it too full to make it worthwhile (knowing Shiojiri is more of alcohol vs attractions)? Has anybody else explored Shiojiri and can say if it's worthwhile to try to make the extra effort to stop there? I don't see a lot of tourists talk about it but other research suggests it's big for Sake and Wine, so thought it'd make a better ""evening"" trip vs full day trip.",post,r/JapanTravel,Comedy,4.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/1kqk5ar/initial_itinerary_check_first_5_days_in_japan/
"I don't know if I have the specific answer to any of your questions but hopefully this helps. In May 2024, I did the following (similar age and pace, although I travelled alone without my husband and family) -
Day 1 -
Train from Ueno to Matsumoto
Explore Matsumoto, frog street, miso factory, castle
Train to KF, lunch and explore (some good looking sake places and other places, and the footpaths were nice but wasn't as scenic/old world feel as Tsumago)
Train to Nagiso (I didn't actually explore the town)
Walk to Tsumago
Overnight in Tsumago (Tsumago was by far my favourite town on the Nakasendo, and much nicer after night. Much much prettier than KF IMO)
Day 2 -
Walk Tsumago to Magome 
Explore Magome (much more touristy than Tsumago and more commercialised I felt, but pretty)
Then I walked to Chuodo Magome to get the train to Nagoya, lunch in the train station, then train to Osaka Namba (the slower Kintetsu direct train in the first class carriage). 
I think I got to Osaka around 4pm and explored for a couple of hours before heading to my hotel in Kyoto. 

I loved this part of my trip - so thought I would just mention it in case the general plan works for you. 

Edit- I had initially wondered why you had checked baggage, as carry on would save time at the airport, but realised this is part of an extended trip.",comment_1,r/JapanTravel,Comedy,,https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/1kqk5ar/initial_itinerary_check_first_5_days_in_japan/
I think so. I didn't get to spend a full day but it had a nice feel to it so happily would have. Well set up for tourists without feeling like Disneyland.,comment_2,r/JapanTravel,Comedy,,https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/1kqk5ar/initial_itinerary_check_first_5_days_in_japan/
"We're doing the opposite because we're heading up to Tohoku after this part of our trip so it made more sense to us to do Tokyo --> Nagoya --> Nakasendo --> Tohoku area --> Tokyo --> Fly home just due to overall logistics and the thought we'll have the most energy and least pained feet if we do Nakasendo sooner rather than later. We were going to also add in 2 days for the Shimanami Kaido initially as well, but it got scratched due to time constraints and wanting to do more in Tohoku as we've spent nearly all of our other time  across Kanto, Kansai, and Kyushu, but never further north.

"Yep that one is 100% on the list! We somehow always accidentally find Yayoi Ksauma's work wherever we go, so it kind of became a thing now and we couldn't miss this one too hahah. We have given Matsumoto 1 full day (with ability to use the second half of the next day if we miss anything due to opening hours, etc., before heading to next base location for a week). I know that's not technically part of this itinerary, but does that sound like a fair amount of time? I have day trip potentials (like to Suwa if we have time - or want to go there as a day trip before going to our next location) so we aren't without things to do, just concerned mainly about time in Matsumoto.",comment_5,r/JapanTravel,Comedy,,https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/1kqk5ar/initial_itinerary_check_first_5_days_in_japan/
"Itinerary Check - Miyajima, Matsushima, Amanohashidate If you haven't guessed it already, I am planning on trying to see the ""3 most scenic spots in Japan"" in one trip. I am not 100% tied to this goal, but I thought it would be fun.

This is going to be my 4th trip to Japan but my first in recent years without a child, and I will go solo. I enjoy eating great meals, viewing temples, art, and vintage shopping. I have been to Tokyo, Hiroshima, Kyoto, Nara, Kamakura, and spent a little time in Osaka.

My kid is almost 3, so I want to focus on seeing and doing things that are either more challenging with a kid or that my family might not be interested in doing.

I know this schedule sounds insane. Should I cut any cities? Or maybe focus on a specific region? Would love your feedback! 

Sunday

* land at Tokyo (Haneda) around 4pm and get to Hiroshima
   * Last trip, I went from Narita to Kyoto after landing at 5:30pm + with a toddler, so I know I can make this work.
   * I am not planning on doing much in Hiroshima. I went at 18, and the Peace Memorial Museum is so impactful that 15 years later, I haven't forgotten the experience.

Monday (this is also national holiday so I am thinking about moving my dates)

* Get to Miyajima and explore
   * Itsukushima Shrine
   * shopping street and snacks
   * ropeway to Mt Misen + hike down
* enjoy onsen at the hotel
* Stay on the island overnight

Tuesday

* see the Itsukushima Shrine Otorii Gate with low tide
* travel to Kurashiki
* explore
   * Bikan Historical Quarter
   * Ohara museum of art 
* Travel to Uno and spend the night there

Wednesday

* Try to get the first Ferry to Naoshima
   * This might be the highest on my list of things to do, mostly because I don't think I will have a chance to do it for another 10 years. I might move the dates of my trip to avoid the craziness of the¬†*Setouchi Triennale*¬†
* \~art\~
   * rent e-bike
   * kusama yayoi x2
   * Chichu art museum
   * Art House Haisha
   * Art House Minamidera
   * Art House Kadoya
* spend the night somewhere, undecided

Thursday

* travel to Amanohashidate
   * Amanohashidate Chairlift and Monorail
   * ferris wheel and viewland
* spend the night in Amanohashidate

Friday

* wake up early to walk across the sandbar and take the fuchu cable car
* take bus to Ine and explore
   * sightseeing boat tour
* another night in Amanoshidate? I need some slow/chill time somewhere

Saturday

* make my way to Sendai (honestly this does seem like an insane journey, I was thinking about staying in Osaka and just doing a day trip to Amanoshidate)
* Sendai
   * vintage shopping
   * Zuih≈çden
   * eat Gyutan

Sunday

* day trip to Matsushima
   * eat sushi
   * Togetsukyo Bridge and Ojima Island
   * Fukuurabashi Bridge and Fukuurajima Island 
   * explore shoreline

Monday

* Morning trip to Yamadera
   * Risshaku-ji Temple
* Souvenir shopping
* Aoba Castle
* Spend another night in Sendai

Tuesday

* travel to Tokyo in the morning
* Tokyo station - Butter Butlers, my favorite 
* last-minute shopping at Airport Garden
* flight at 8pm

I also have a reservation at Hakone Ginyu that I made when I thought I would be taking the trip with my husband. I have wanted to go there for 8+ years, and originally made a reservation for our April 2020 honeymoon. I still haven't canceled it yet since it's not really on my radar anymore.

"Is this one of the rare times where the JP National Rail Pass actually pays off?


Tokyo - Hiroshima would cost 20000 yen, and Hiroshima - Sendai 28000 yen. You are only 2000 yen away from making up for its cost.",comment_1,r/JapanTravel,Comedy,,https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/1kqkvcy/itinerary_check_miyajima_matsushima_amanohashidate/
"A couple of thoughts: 

\- Haneda to Hiroshima - You can do it, but it will take about 4.5 hours once you get through immigration and customs to get from Haneda, to Shinagawa, to Hiroshima. The shinkansen ride alone is 3hrs 45 minutes. Hopefully, you will get through Haneda quickly but, if it takes a while (and it can), then be prepared to get to Hiroshima pretty late. 

\- I've done Amanohashidate before as a day trip from Kyoto. Ideally, on Wednesday night, I think you should stay in Kyoto, somewhere fairly near Kyoto station. Otherwise, you're going to have a very long trip to Amanohashidate on Thursday. 

\- I would break up your trip from Amanohashidate to Sendai somewhere along the way - could be Kyoto, Osaka or Kobe, could be Nagoya, could be Tokyo, could be somewhere else. Otherwise, you're going to be spending about 7 hours on a train, maybe even more. 

\- Another possibility for your trip from Amanohashidate to Sendai is to instead go from Amanohashidate to Toyooka and catch a plane from Toyooka to Sendai.",comment_2,r/JapanTravel,Comedy,,https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/1kqkvcy/itinerary_check_miyajima_matsushima_amanohashidate/
"FYI Zuihoden and Aoba are like one stop off from each other on the Sendai Loople bus. There's no reason to do them on different days, as once you've left the city center or wherever you're staying to get to Zuihoden, you're already right there. If you're making a huge effort to travel, just enjoy your first night in Sendai shopping and eating, take it easy and do Zuihoden/Aoba via the Loople and see if there's any other neat things to do on your way back (we decided to stop at the prefectural art museum, very worth it on a rainy day).",comment_3,r/JapanTravel,Comedy,,https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/1kqkvcy/itinerary_check_miyajima_matsushima_amanohashidate/
"Haven‚Äôt been to Amanohashidate, but am familiar with the other areas, particularly Matsushima.

The ‚Äúeat sushi‚Äù goal might be more challenging than you expect as the area is absolutely mobbed at lunch time.  Consider attempting this as a breakfast or brunch endeavour.  Have also noticed that Zuiganji is not on your itinerary.

I‚Äôm married to a Japanese person and the point of our trips to Japan is to keep our kid connected with the country and family ties there. I am getting to do more things for myself by getting up and going out at dawn, nobody misses me for those first 5-6 hours of the day and It‚Äôs when most of the places I visit are at their most magical.  This year (with my family‚Äôs blessing) I‚Äôve arranged for a 3 night solo mini trip but will keep the habit of getting up super early to go explore.

I find the Sendai Loople comments contradictory to my own experience (in April and August) of a service that is unable to cope with the demands placed on it.  Big queues and long waits and buses that are completely packed.  It‚Äôs worth looking at other ways to get around Sendai.  Perhaps it‚Äôs different when there is still snow around, but in warmer months this service is extremely frustrating.

"I went to Sendai last month, for gyutan I'd highly recommend Gyutan-Kaku Vlandome. The meat was much more juicy and delicious compared to Date no Gyutan main store that we went to during the same trip.

For Matsushima, I went to Shiogama wholesale fish market first for breakfast sashimi -- though we got there ""late"" at 10am-ish so a lot of stuff were already sold out. Many of the pieces were sold in a platter so a bit challenging if there's no one to share with. Then did the Shiogama to Matsushima ferry, allegedly less crowded compared to the opposite direction journey. Arrived at Matsushima around 1pm and there was enough time to see almost everything I wanted to (everything closed around 4-5pm).

I purchased Sendai area pass for a few days, but frankly it was only worth it if going to further places like Yamadera. The Loople bus only ran every 20 minutes or so and was always crowded, and everything closed at 4pm (I made the mistake of only heading out at 11+).",comment_5,r/JapanTravel,Comedy,,https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/1kqkvcy/itinerary_check_miyajima_matsushima_amanohashidate/
"Itinerary Advice Please! First time in Japan Travelling to Japan for about the first 3 weeks of June, flying into Osaka and home from Tokyo so naturally starting & finishing in those places. Having a bit of trouble deciding what to do in the middle - initially was planning to go to Okinawa, but im a bit apprehensive about the weather so was considering going up to Takayama and spending some time there/ around Kamikochi or potentially flying up to Hokkaido. I did want to go to Hiroshima after Kyoto, but if I end up going north it could be a bit out of the way and add too much travel time so considering postponing that to a future trip. Any advice would be appreciated!! My itinerary I have planned so far is below - please also let me know any places I might have missed or if it seems too rushed, thankyou :))

"No Okinawa is the right call. As others have said, train to Tokyo especially if you're doing this much traveling. 

Are you traveling light luggage-wise? If not, and are willing to do long days, some of these could plausibly be daytrips - Hiroshima/Miyajima from Osaka especially, though it would be a long day.

For Mt Fuji I'd try to be flexible on which day you do this, so that you can target a good-weather day... although this would also mean doing it as a daytrip from Tokyo (perfectly possible, but it would disrupt your accommodation plan).",comment_5,r/JapanTravel,Comedy,,https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/1kq9pad/itinerary_advice_please_first_time_in_japan/

"Be prepared to not do everything on your Kawaguchiko day. You're in a mountain town; it's going to take a minute to get to places. And it's a Saturday, so you'll be jostling with both the international tourists and the Japanese weekenders in the crowds. And you're trying to squeeze in an amusement park. 

  
The Asakusa/Ueno/Akihabara day also stood out to me. You can do all three in one day, but it will be rushed, and you plan to wake up early for a big day trip the next day. And (for me at least), the main thing to do in Ueno Park are the museums, which take some time.

"flying with NOT FRESH ear infection I know that it is generally very recommended to not do it- but Im wondering if due to my timeline Im okay (at least from physical damage)

Infection started last weds. saturday went to urgent care and got oral amox-clav antibiotics saturday. they werent very effective, monday tues i was in pain. tues night i started having fever. weds thurs still fever but ear pain mostly stopped. went to doctors yesterday, she said it looks like swimmers ear (outer infection) and gave me an antibiotic injection, ear drops, and oral antibiotic. last night and this morning im feeling much better. again no pain, never had discharge, fever seems to have subsided. 

moving the flight would be extremely expensive... my doctor said she doesnt think i am at risk of doing damage, but that itll probably hurt a lot. my plan is to take a dose of the ear drops before boarding, and sudafed + ibuprofen around an hour before landing.

TLDR- considering I am being treated, have had symptom reduction + no acute ear pain for 3-4 days, and my doc said unlikely that i will damage anything, am i still extremely stupid for flying out this evening?

"Last spring I flew about 2 weeks after a serious ear infection/ruptured eardrum. I still couldn't hear well at that point but the flying didn't seem to worsen things and I had less pain than I anticipated. Certainly way less than when I was having drainage and nearly no hearing at the start of the whole ordeal.

The thing I found most helpful in clearing my ears was a steroid nasal spray. Maybe ask your doc if that would be appropriate for you?

"What happens if I refuse to pay rental car damages that I did not create? I rented a vehicle through one of the largest rental company in the US. Upon returning the car I was not informed of any damages, but received notification later that there were new damages. 

This notification had a before and after photo coming from an automated system, with the after photo circling a small scratch on the hubcap. Small enough I don‚Äôt even think it would have been noticed on a human inspection. The before photo is taken at a different angle and also completely different lighting. An automated chat bot sent me a different photo as proof which actually appears to show the damage in the pre-rental photo. I am nearly certain this damage was pre existing. I am also 100% certain I did not hit anything with the car and even if this is new it is normal wear and tear. 

At this point I have spent multiple weeks calling and emailing, have been redirected all over the place. Nobody is able to help me. Emails have not been responded to. I can‚Äôt even begin to dispute this damage as nobody will talk to me. I am coming up in the ‚Äúfinal date‚Äù to pay before extra fees will be charged. 

I am wondering what the risk is to me if I refuse to pay. It‚Äôs only a few hundred dollars, so I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs worth the trouble if there is substantial risk to my credit or something like that. But, I also really don‚Äôt want to pay this without even being given the opportunity to dispute the claim.",post,r/TravelHacks,Comedy,34.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/TravelHacks/comments/1kt4g6w/what_happens_if_i_refuse_to_pay_rental_car/

"International 2FA SMS and calls with iPhone left at home? I will be traveling internationally for several months and want to be able to receive SMS 2FA and calls to my US phone number on AT&T without incurring roaming charges. Here's my proposed plan; is it viable?

* Set up my AppleID account's message forwarding, WiFi calling, and Calls on Other Devices
* Leave this phone at home in the US, plugged in to power and active on my home WiFi as well as AT&T cellular
* Travel with my other devices (iPhone, iPad) and purchase eSIM and/or use WiFi in the countries I travel to

"You're getting some mixed answers about what happens if you arrive late for your international flight on Delta, but the answer isn't so simple.  As a full-service airline in the U.S., Delta will usually rebook you for free if you arrive at the check-in counter a little late.  (When you call Delta, ask if they will tell you their exact definition of ""a little late."")

If you were also traveling internationally on American (or another oneWorld carrier) instead of Delta, American has a policy that will protect you *even on separate tickets*, which AFAIK is unique among U.S. airlines.

If you were on a low-cost carrier (such as Zipair to Tokyo) and arrived just a little late for check-in, they would tell you they are sorry but you have to buy a new ticket.

These ""flat-tire rules"" can save you in a pinch, but I wouldn't rely on them.

"Free Trial eSIM Services: Test Before You Commit As someone who loves finding deals and free offers when traveling, I discovered that some International and US companies now offer free trials for their services, which you can use both locally and abroad!. You don‚Äôt need a credit card, and there‚Äôs no need for a physical SIM card, just an eSIM to get started.

**Hack for Travelers:** If you‚Äôre visiting the US from abroad, you can install these eSIM plans as long as your phone is compatible and unlocked. It‚Äôs a great way to get connected quickly and avoid roaming. It‚Äôs definitely worth looking into, as it could be a great hack.

If you‚Äôve already tried any of these services, I‚Äôd love to hear about your experience. Would you recommend them? While these trials are a great way to test things out, they may not allow you to fully assess the pros and cons of a provider in such a short time.

Here‚Äôs a roundup of some of the best eSIM free trial offers:

**US Cellular**

* 30-day trial via the app
* Keep your current phone, carrier, and number
* A convenient option if you‚Äôre not ready to switch everything over yet

**AT&T**

* 30-day free trial
* Full access to their wireless network
* No credit card or commitments required

**Visible**

* 15-day free trial
* Unlimited Verizon 5G & 4G LTE coverage
* No credit card or payment required

**Cricket Wireless**

* 14-day trial
* No credit card needed to activate

**GigSky**

* Free eSIM trial with 100MB of data
* Great for testing their international service

**Verizon**

* 30-day free trial
* No credit card required to start

**MobileX**

* Free eSIM trial with up to 10 days of service
* 5GB of data included
* No credit card for activation

**Nomad**

* Free 500MB eSIM data trial
* Great for travel

While these are some of the top options I‚Äôve found, there are also international providers offering great coverage and discounts, though I haven‚Äôt found any offering free eSIM trials.

**Tip:**  
Check out the network coverage, see how fast the speeds are, and make sure customer support is responsive. The last thing you want is to get stuck with a provider that leaves you stranded when you need help the most!",post,r/TravelHacks,Comedy,5.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/TravelHacks/comments/1ks7fji/free_trial_esim_services_test_before_you_commit/

"Questions about Hertz rental at TPA 
*Posting this here because I have been completely unable to reach the Hertz counter at the Tampa International Airport. Their phone line just disconnects whenever I try any of their automated options. Hopefully someone here is knowledgeable/ has experience with this.*

I‚Äôm 23, looking to rent a car in Florida for about a week. I am a AAA member, which is why I‚Äôm using Hertz in the first place (no young driver fees). I have two questions:

1. Does Hertz rent pickup trucks to ‚Äúyoung drivers‚Äù (ie. under 25)? I haven‚Äôt been able to find any information on this. Their website says young drivers can rent small/large sedans, SUVs, and minivans, and that young drivers are excluded from all the fancy cars. Nowhere does it mention pickups. 

2. Does the Hertz at TPA accept after-hours drops? Also can‚Äôt find any information on that. I would need to use the after hour drop, so this is important.

Sounds high on the hotel nightly rates,comment_2,r/TravelHacks,Comedy,,https://www.reddit.com/r/TravelHacks/comments/1ksgymm/is_this_too_much_money_for_my_portugal_trip_aug/
"Yes, $870 during the summer is normal. That is probably the cheapest you‚Äôll find during this season, especially since it‚Äôs from NYC. Assuming JFK. It‚Äôs the biggest airport closest to Europe so the flights are always cheapest there. Lisbon is overpriced like a mf due to American and British expats. That‚Äôs why the hotel is so expensive. But still $300 a night is outrageous. You should find something amazing for under $200. I‚Äôm asumming your hotel is somewhere near Chiado or Pra√ßa do comercio. Try to go a little more north, you really don‚Äôt want to stay near the center, or towards the west of the center. Try north, northeast. But $150-200 you should find a nice place. 

Porto is a little cheaper than Lisbon so take this in consideration. I have only lived in Lisbon though, not in Porto so I can‚Äôt give you much advice on that.

I don‚Äôt know if you‚Äôre going alone or with a partner, or with family, but I‚Äôd say each person if you buy lunch and dinner, buy coffees, pasteis de nata, go for a beer, it‚Äôll be around $100 max, probably less. As for the activities, transportation, souvenirs, dirt cheap. But yeah the hotel, I‚Äôd find something cheaper.

I only wrote the first post because I personally don‚Äôt see visiting Lisbon and Porto as 4k. Id probably go somewhere with more things to do and see",comment_3,r/TravelHacks,Comedy,,https://www.reddit.com/r/TravelHacks/comments/1ksgymm/is_this_too_much_money_for_my_portugal_trip_aug/
"Portugal is a pretty country. It has mountains, beaches, the beaches with those big rocks with waves crashing into them. Portugal has architecture different from the rest of Europe with tiles covering the walls on all the buildings. And tile sidewalks. The rest of Europe is stone. 

Southern Europe (portugal Spain southern Italy) have very poor economies, no jobs, very low salaries. It still is like that. They used to be very cheap countries to reflect the salaries. Then all the expats moved in and raised the prices. The reality is that people move to portugal thinking they‚Äôre going to be paying for everything dirt cheap. But it‚Äôs not like that anymore. Yes it is cheaper than the US. But I‚Äôd say something $5 in USA is $3 in Lisbon. So yes it‚Äôs cheaper but it‚Äôs not something absolutely abnormal. 

Porto and Lisbon are the biggest cities in Portugal and they have their beauty, but there really is not a whole lot to do in them. From a tourism standpoint there aren‚Äôt many activities. Soak in what‚Äôs around you. The architecture, river, Cristo rei. 

My interests in traveling probably arent the same as yours because I‚Äôve seen more but I don‚Äôt like being stuck in a city. I like nature more. But Casc√°is (a town to the west of Lisbon) is smaller, has pretty beaches, and is a very pretty town that you need to visit, from the Cais do sodre train station you can buy a $2 train ticket to there. 100% need to do that. 

Another reason why I‚Äôm not the biggest fan of Lisbon is because it has serverely lost its portuguese culture by immigration. In the center and through Cais do sodre and praca do comercio you will hear more English than portuguese. Also you will see an absurd amount of Indians and Africans that don‚Äôt have anything to do with portugues culture.

"Advice: Short Layover or Last flight out to destination? Hello All! 

Looking for advice for which flight I should take to guarantee I arrive during my travel day.

The airline is Vueling. 

I am traveling from Istanbul to Ibiza and have 2 flight options that both have a layover in Barcelona.

Option 1: 55 minute layover in Barcelona to take 9:55pm flight to final destination 

Option 2: 1 hour 50 min layover in Barcelona to take 10:50pm flight to final destination (this is the last flight of the day to Ibiza) 

I‚Äôm torn between the 2 options because Option 1 seems risky with the short layover time (I called Vueling - they said I would NOT have to go through passport control during my layover) vs Option 2 is risky since it‚Äôs the last flight to Ibiza that day. I know if it gets cancelled I can take the next flight out in the morning but that is an issue for me because I have scheduled activities that start early on Thursday. 

I plan to check a hold bag and take random seats (so I could be at the back of the plane).",post,r/TravelHacks,Comedy,2.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/TravelHacks/comments/1krx0lp/advice_short_layover_or_last_flight_out_to/

I'd probably take the earlier layover because if you miss it then they will probably rebook you onto the 10:50pm departure anyway?

"I‚Äôd go with Option 2. A 55-min layover sounds tight, especially with a checked bag and random seat. Even if you technically don‚Äôt go through passport control, delays happen, and bags can slow you down.

Making the 55 minute layover will all depend if  the outbound is delayed. Would go on to flight aware and track the history. Many flights out of IST are often delayed.

""A ""Third-Party Website"" is a website that is not owned by Choice or a Choice franchisee that: (i) sells Choice's inventory of rooms directly to consumers; (ii) provides a confirmation of a completed reservation at the time of completion of such reservation; and (iii) that does not require membership or login.

"Air travel with 5 and 2 yo Treat me like I'm 5 and what I need to do for air travel for kids on the plane. It will be their first trip (2.5hr) and I've only flown twice myself. Husband is an expert, but sans kids. Myrtle beach is the destination. 

Both are in FF 5point harness car seats currently and I'm unsure what to bring for the trip. I'd be open to buying cheaper seats for the trip, as their normal seats are pretty bulky. I know the harnesses exist but those are like $170 a piece.

What's recommended for both ages? The 5 year old would probably be fine in a normal seatbelt and I could rent a seat with the car, or get a harness for plane.
The 2 year old would probably be best contained in a seat .. 
if we're bringing a seat for the 2 year old, I don't mind bringing one also for the older kid- (he's large though 50lbs and tall)
I need some expert advice üôÉ
Is a car seat dolly worth it ?

I know tons of snacks is good, random odds and ends to play with, tablets..

Also, is a wagon worth bringing? I have the larger Veer and have heard those can be gate checked for delta.. I don't even know what that means, does it go below the plane still? I wouldn't want to bring it if it gets thrown down there.",post,r/TravelHacks,Comedy,0.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/TravelHacks/comments/1krb1vx/air_travel_with_5_and_2_yo/
"The ride safer ‚Äúcar seat‚Äù cannot be used on an airplane. 

There are the cares harnesses which are ~$50 and only for airplanes. 

Keep in mind that many car seats will not fit due to size and most airlines require them to be in the window seat. 

Unless you have a small travel stroller like a gbpockit, it will go in the hold with everything else (the same with a car seat). 

Make sure the 2YO is able to use earphones. It can take a couple weeks to ‚Äútrain‚Äù them. 

Sell up juice/soda on the plane and unlimited screen time. 

The more stressed you are, the more stressed/act out the kids will be. Kids are humans too. 2YO cry and act their age. They are allowed to. As a parent on the plane people care that are you trying to help them and get more irritated at parents that don‚Äôt do anything than kids that are crying. 

If the youngest is in diapers brings some ziplocks and when they have their poop on the plane, put the diaper in a ziplock before you trash it. 

You can check a car seat. Sometimes renting is more expensive than actually buying a car seat. 

We use a cares harnesses for our 2YO and nothing for our 4 year old. 

We use a ride safer vest for the 4YO (a booster in europe/places the vest isn‚Äôt approved) and a wayb pico for the 2YO (wouldn‚Äôt recommend buying one for a single trip, we travel a lot).

The car vest and the airplane vest are different. Don‚Äôt bother with those. Just carry on the car seat for the 2yo and use it on the plane. At 5 I‚Äôd get a booster and carry it on but you can‚Äôt use it. Don‚Äôt get the inflatable booster at that age- ours just played on it and we had to go buy a real one anyway bc it wasn‚Äôt safe. 6 is more like the minimum for that. We always flew with a Diono radian bc it folds into a backpack and is super skinny so it fits easily on planes. It‚Äôs also low enough the tray works over it. Not cheap but it‚Äôs a really good seat anyway.

Btw, bag is most likely to be lost in transit, not stuck at home, so in your case it would reach china but not Japan. But also, even if you know its lost, it doesent help you much, you are in transit and will only get to complain over it not coming, when you reach the end destination.

I bought my tracker for buses and trains. I have taken a few rides where I drop my bag either at the luggage area of the train or under the bus, then sit far from it. And I get anxious if the bag is still there. If I have a tracker, I will know that it is. Realistically, if someone takes it, the bus or train isnt gonna stop for me. But it gives peace of mind that I dont have to keep looking at everybody leaving the bus if they are about to steal my bag.

For flights, always pack essentials in carry on. In case of missed connection, whilst you could technically get your bag out, it takes a ton of extra time. And in case the bag is delayed.

Credit is issued essentially issued the moment they the flight is canceled. Sometimes it's a manual process, usually when processing through the airline it's automatic.

"An app to store travel-related location- or type-specific information Dear Travel Hackers,

I am looking for an app or Website to store travel-related, location-specific (e.g., city, region or country) or type-specific (e.g., restaurants, hotels, parks, museums, entertainment, etc.) information/addresses. Tripadvisor is well-known, and presumably can do the job. However, unless I don't know how to use the app, the only way to store/bookmark good addresses is by trip. Now suppose I am going back to, say, Paris, and I want to go back to that fantastic restaurant that I went to on a previous trip. Of course if I had saved that restaurant in a previous trip to Paris, I could always go back to that previous trip saved in Tripadvisor and find that restaurant again. However, if I am planning a trip and want to go back to a few of my favorite places, I would have to go to previous trips saved in Tripadvisor, then select each preferred place or activity and add them one at a time in a new trip. So unless there is a way of filtering by location and/or type of activity, this is not practical at all.

Please don't recommend Yelp: my preferred restaurants are simply not indexed in that app half of the time. I might ditch this app soon.

One thing that I have done is to store my preferred places in Apple Maps or Google Maps. Apple Maps is okay, in that the number of indexed places is quite extensive (almost as much as Google Maps), and it allows to create guides (in French), which are essentially folders to store addresses. I have created location-specific guides, and Apple Maps has type-specific icons (e.g. for restaurants, hotels, museums, etc.) that allow to see what type of place each saved address is. This works OK, but I was just wandering if there was a travel-dedicated app out there that allows to sequentially apply several filters in any order (e.g., location and type of activity, or vice-versa) on saved addresses.

"US Airways ‚ÄúTravel-Ready Center‚Äù? Hey all-

1st time leaving the country next month. Flying from the US to Turkey for approximately 2 weeks. 

Checking my trip details via the United Airlines app, it says there is ‚Äúattention needed‚Äù in the ‚ÄúTravel-Ready Center‚Äù on the app itself. 

It looks like it wants me to input passport & visa information into the app (and it says it should be done PRIOR to check-in at the airport). 

Is this something I actually NEED to do, or is it just a pre-screening type thing to save time at check-in? 

*Also, I haven‚Äôt applied for a visa since my trip is tourism-related and only 14(ish) days long. Feel free to correct me if that isn‚Äôt correct*

We convinced her to go to England to see her sister one more time and were able to pool funds for business class, hoping she will be more comfortable and fingers crossed extra attention.

"Print out everything for her.  All tickets, connections, directions, arrangements you‚Äôve made for her.  Print out copies of airport maps. Also her passport.  

You can request additional assistance from the airline as well (not just wheelchair, which is provided by contractors paid by the airport).  You can probably get a security pass to escort her to the plane (she could be considered a vulnerable adult).  

There are also ID bracelets you can get that can include: Name, Age, country of Origin, Emergency Contacts, Blood Type and/or Medication. I have one that attaches to my Smart Watch.  I got mine on Amazon.  

If you can‚Äôt have a family member meet her at the destination, arrange for a driver to pick her up.  

Does she have a smart phone?  Make sure that location services are enabled and her location can be shared with you, her sister, etc.  

You can also check out paid services like this: https://www.airportassist.com/services.  Don‚Äôt forget to make sure she has emergency medical insurance (I am sure you know that Medicare generally doesn‚Äôt cover anything outside of the US).  Even some private insurers have limited coverage.  

It might cost a bit to provide these additional supports but substantially less than another biz class ticket.  

I would recommend you also talk to her, and listen for clues about what she needs.  Don‚Äôt assume you know.  Travel can be overwhelming at any age, particularly when you‚Äôre tired, hungry and thirsty. Make sure she has a water bottle and snacks, even though she will get a meal on the flight.  

There are a few other ways you can make things easier.  
- Send her luggage ahead through a service. Then she only needs a large totebag under her seat.

Currently split between Capital One venture and Barclays JetBlue card (I used to travel often on JetBlue so this was beneficial, however I moved and no longer need the jetblue, so I plan to change to a new card for most spending)



For hotels, I basically just want to earn the most points per night as possible. I sign up for promotions every time I see them. 

For airlines, pretty much the same thing. Any way to get faster points. Most of my travel is Delta or American. I just recently paired my Hertz and Marriott, I found you can get 500 marriot points per Hertz reservation (this was back credited for 6 months worth) I also found I can book hotels and cars through Delta and receive MQDs. As long as the price is the same as the website my company books through, then it's a Non issue.

My driving in Mexico has been limited to Baja (northern border regions and around La Paz) and as another poster pointed out, I take the cuota (toll roads) as much as possible and drive during the day only. 

We have been pulled over once for a made up traffic violation and a bullshit fine and that was in a very touristy part of La Paz. Officer went through the motions of how he would have to confiscate my husband‚Äôs license, take it to the station, but the station would be closed until Monday, blah blah blah and then says ‚Äú‚Ä¶or you can pay a fine now‚Äù. We didn‚Äôt have enough cash for the amount he said so we just said ‚Äúall we have is‚Ä¶‚Äù and he said okay and took our money, gave him back his license, and left.

From my understanding, that‚Äôs the order of operations. The bribe can‚Äôt be your idea but if they don‚Äôt bring it up themselves, I have been told to ask if there is a fine you can pay on the spot. But this has only happened to me once in dozens of times driving in Mexico. 

Either way, driving can be stressful there, but mostly it‚Äôs location dependent. An urban area is going to be a lot more chaotic but that‚Äôs just the nature of the city.

"question about major rental car companies' ""pay ahead"" policies Hi! so, i've noticed with Avis preferred when you ""pay now"" at the beginning of the rental, while you do save some money and there's no need to wait at the desk to get the vehicle at an airport, there's also no way to have a real person help you with the contract - regardless of the circumstance or details or injustice (eg you have your own ezpass, register the plates to it, and still get charged by avis).. you're pretty much SOL , per their staff, if you chose ""pay now"" .. this is more or less verbatim what I was told by an in person counter agent.   she just said she agreed but was powerless to alter anything - not return day, nothing..   

so my question - anyone know if other major rental car companies are better about this?  can you get a live human on the customer service 800 number to ask a question if you need to?  If so, which ones do you recommend?

#####1. About
I travelled non-stop around the world from July 2023 ‚Äì December 2024. I travelled for a total of 532 days, visiting 7 continents and ~65 countries.

[Itinerary and locations visited.](https://worldli.substack.com/p/itinerary-round-the-world)

Very short trip summary in comments.

**About me**

27M (25 start of trip). It was always my lifelong dream to travel around the world and to do so as literally as possible. Meant to do this trip when I graduated university, but that‚Äôs when COVID hit. Waited patiently for 3 years before I quit my job, bought a one-way ticket to LA, and followed the map until I reached home.

**Travel style**

Easygoing, curious and like to try new things. A travel buddy described it as ‚Äúopen-minded, like to connect with others, and into local culture‚Äù. Mostly, I went with the flow and took opportunities as they came, and ended up with a great mix of nature, culture, food and party. The only thing I made sure to do in every city was try any local specialities.

I am not a morning person, but forced to be one to catch cheap early flights. Overall, this was very budget travel with occasional splurges. This meant staying in the cheapest hostels, having the cheapest meals, and using public/shared transport wherever possible. I didn‚Äôt have money, but I had time and a willingness to put myself through admin logistical hell.

Hot take ‚Äì walking tours are overrated and I stopped doing them after the first few.

I also like to think I‚Äôve permanently added an extra day to my life, since I never had to lose a day after gaining one :)


#####2. Big 3 - Transport, Accomodation, Food


**Transport**


Plane: 63 | Bus: 40 | Train: 23 | Van/Car: 16 | Boat: 5 | Lando: 1

(as a means of shifting cities/trips. Does not include day trips, public transport or rideshare/taxis)

I considered all transport options when moving place to place and usually went for the cheapest option. This led to many long haul bus rides (record stands at 28h). Tip: limit water intake so you don‚Äôt need to use the bathroom.


**Accommodation**

Couch: 197 | Hostel: 139 | Shared private: 120 | Camping: 42 | Solo private: 16 | Transport: 18

I consider myself extremely lucky to have friends who were generous enough to host me. I also couchsurfed with complete strangers (through the couchsurfing app). I am forever grateful for those 197 nights. Every time I crashed someone‚Äôs couch, I wasn‚Äôt just welcomed into their homes but also into their lives. Had some very local, unique and unforgettable experiences I wouldn‚Äôt have had otherwise

Crashing couches also significantly reduced costs. I like to buy gifts or treat hosts to meals, so some accommodation costs may be reflected in my food/gifts budget. I also ended up traveling with others a fair bit, and splitting the cost of a private was often on par with/more affordable than a hostel.

**Food**

Eating out: 90% | Cooking: 10%

I ate out 90% of the time, and generally ate 2 meals per day. I developed a sixth sense in finding the cheapest but best tasting spots in any given city. Trying new food is a huge part of my travels and I can‚Äôt cook ‚Äì so 2 birds 1 stone. Though, I was forced to stretch my culinary skills at times for the sake of budget.

#####3. Budget

Total cost: ~$68,000AUD (45,000USD)

This amount covers all expenses, including pre-trip costs such as passport and vaccinations. I initially budgeted $50,000AUD for 1 year of travel and aimed for an average daily spend of $100. I decided to dip into my emergency savings (~$20,000) to extend the trip. The $100 per day estimate was based on prior research, however most of that travel information was pre-covid. Since then, inflation has not been kind - e.g. restaurant prices being double what menus showed just 2-3 years ago when I checked on Google Maps. Plus, the Aussie dollar was consistently letting me down. Given that, I‚Äôm pretty content with how my average daily spend turned out.

**Budget Breakdown (approximate)**

Flights: $10.5k

Food: $9.5k

Accommodation: $7.2k

Transport: $5.5k

Activities: $5.2k

Alcohol/Party: $3.6k

Discretionary: $3k

Ancillary costs: $1k

Passport/Visas: $1.6k

Health: $2k

Gifts: $1.6k

Antarctica: $10k

Africa overland (tour): $5.2k

Northwest US road trip: $1k

*Discretionary costs cover expenses which I bought as a ‚Äúwant‚Äù ‚Äì i.e. clothes, souvenirs, tattoos, etc. Ancillary costs cover things like SIM cards and exchange fees.*


#####4. Pack
My journey was carry-on only and there were zero instances where I checked in my bag, notwithstanding the fact that it weighed ~12kg. I had an Osprey Farpoint 40L, a bum bag, and a packable daypack.

My pack underwent a lot of changes over the 18 months (naturally), as I binned/donated/sent back some items and took on others. Overtime my pack became a lot more functional than fashionable. You would have never caught me dead in cargo pants before this trip, but by the end, the only bottoms I owned were detachable 2-in-1 cargos that converted into shorts. I intend to do a deeper pack breakdown, but here are the key takeaways:

**Essentials**

- Passport/Important Documents/Phone/Meds
- Noise cancelling earphones
- Shower slippers
- Sleeping Eye Mask/Ear Plugs
- Carabiners/Hero Clip
- Travel adapter
- Non-TSA lock

**Nice to haves**

- Airtags
- Inflatable pillow (didn‚Äôt realise how good this was until I got one)
- Quick dry clothing
- Dry bag
- Portable clothes line
- Portable mini fan
- Travel towel
- Raincoat/bag cover
- Duct tape

#####7. Advice

**Tips**

- *No plan is the best plan* ‚Äì most of my favourite travel moments were unexpected, and only possible due to my absent planning. Some of my biggest regrets were passing up opportunities because I‚Äôd already committed to other plans. The longer your travels the less planning you should do.

- *Travel carry-on* ‚Äì cheaper transport, less stuff to worry about, and no risk of lost luggage.

- *Manage burnout* ‚Äì long term travel is no vacation. Constantly being on the move is exhausting. Planning and logistics were the bane of my existence. It‚Äôs OK to slow down, have a Netflix day, or just stay put for a while.

- *It‚Äôs OK to not do everything* ‚Äì I often felt the need to see or do something purely because it was listed as a ‚Äútop thing to do in x‚Äù. It‚Äôs much better to allocate your time, energy and money on things you genuinely want to do.

- *Leave your comfort zone* ‚Äì most of my favourite experiences came from doing something I was hesitant to at first (subtle difference vs not being interested).

- *‚Äúhello‚Äù & ‚Äúthank you‚Äù* ‚Äì learn these in whatever country you‚Äôre in and your experience will increase tenfold.

- *Wear shower slippers* ‚Äì I shouldn‚Äôt even have to put this here, but I‚Äôve met people who rawdog communal showers, and that might be one of the scariest things I‚Äôve encountered this trip.

- *Walk* ‚Äì as a means of transport. Saves money, no hassle with public transport, and is a great way to see a place.

- *Keep a private daily log* ‚Äì I kept a journal on my phone, jotting down what happened each day and how I was feeling. Some entries short, others longer if I had more energy, but I‚Äôm glad I kept it up. Reading those notes can take you right back to those moments. I suggest keeping it private as it‚Äôs a good way to be honest with yourself.

- *Keep a shared journal/record* ‚Äì a few months into my trip, I was gifted this notebook which I‚Äôd use to ask people I met along the way to add something to (write/draw/life advice/anything). It‚Äôs nice to look back on those messages and memories. I‚Äôve seen other versions too, e.g. a playlist where everyone adds a song.

- *Document everything* ‚Äì I try not to have any regrets, but not documenting enough might be one of them. I wish I took more photos/videos/notes.

- *Check for bed bugs* ‚Äì only takes a minute and saves you from a travel nightmare.

- *Safety* ‚Äì share your location with people you trust, exercise common sense (don‚Äôt walk alone at night, don‚Äôt get too drunk), exercise proper precautions.

- *Don‚Äôt go to Japan or China during summer.*

**Budget Tips**

- Hostels > hotels. Not only cheaper, but it‚Äôs a great way to meet people, more helpful in terms of tips and local guidance, and honestly safer. Just make sure you pick a good one.

- Get a travel towel so you never have to rent one (even though they‚Äôre pretty cheap to rent anyway).

- I generally hand washed everything if I didn‚Äôt have access to a (free) washing machine. Especially since I packed light so I didn‚Äôt have many clothes in the first place. Would either wash it in the shower or dry bag.

- Look into credit card churning and how to utilise frequent flyer points. Most offer complimentary travel insurance (side note: mine expired after a year, I then decided that risking my life was worth saving $800 ‚Äì do not do this).

- Stay longer in cheaper regions.

- Move around less.

- Bring your student ID for discounts (even if you‚Äôve graduated, if it doesn‚Äôt have an expiry date, it‚Äôs worth a shot).

- Eat at local places ‚Äì it‚Äôs a much better culinary, cultural and financial experience. University areas are usually cheaper.

**General**

- *People are kind* - and much more open and warmer than western corporate life.

- *Trust your gut* - somehow your instincts just know.

- *Trust that you can figure it out.*

- *Goodbyes don‚Äôt get easier.*

- *Shared experiences are best* ‚Äì solo travelling can be liberating, but sharing those moments make them better.

- *Gain perspective* ‚Äì e.g. trying to navigate Latin America (cheaply) for 6 months with zero Spanish made me appreciate how challenging it must be for immigrants starting fresh in a new country ‚Äì something I‚Äôd never truly understood as a native English speaker.

- *Money solves a lot of problems*, but lacking that, it can be solved with time, energy and inconvenience.

- *The world is big* ‚Äì with so so so much more out there beyond your hometown and social circle (how could you not want to see and experience it all!?!?).

- *The world is small* ‚Äì everything and everyone is only a bus/train/plane ticket away. You never know who you‚Äôll bump into even in the unlikeliest of places.

#####8. Closing thoughts
Looking back at the past 18 months, the whole thing feels like a movie. It‚Äôs a very weird and bittersweet feeling. It‚Äôs hard to believe I was living out of a backpack and travelling the world just a year ago. Now, being back home and back in corporate, it feels like stepping into a completely different life.

Catching up with friends, I‚Äôd answer questions and give broad highlights before conversation moved elsewhere. Of course everyone is amazed and interested in your travels, but if we‚Äôre being honest, unless they‚Äôre as into travel as you are, most don‚Äôt care or ‚Äúget it‚Äù. So it is pretty weird having these experiences, only to come back and feel that disconnect. I guess that‚Äôs the downside/weird thing about solo travel - these experiences and memories are yours and yours alone. That‚Äôs partly why I enjoy travelling with others too; it‚Äôs like there‚Äôs someone else there to validate what you went through.

Despite the above, which is just me venting post travel depression, I have zero regrets and it truly was the trip of a lifetime. While I can rave about all the amazing places and incredible meals, the best part of the trip was 100% the people. If you‚Äôre in this sub and reading this trip report, you must be interested in travelling, and I can 100% recommend.",post,r/solotravel,Comedy,105.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1ktisuj/rtw_trip_report_532_days_7_continents_65_countries/
"**Very short trip summary:**

**North America:** I kicked off this journey at a country I am very familiar with, that being the god blessed land of USA. During university, I completed an exchange semester in America so I was very much looking forward to catching up with friends that I hadn‚Äôt seen in years and ordering some chic-fil-a. I also figured it was the best way to ease into my travels, since I‚Äôm familiar with the country, it‚Äôs English speaking, and it was basically one big reunion. I think I managed to visit 12-15 states over the span of 1.5 months. Managed to sneak in a quick 6 day trip to Toronto.

**Latin America:** I ended my USA (+ Canada) leg in NYC, subsequently flying from Newark to Mexico City. This would kick off the beginning of my ‚Äúreal travel‚Äù, where I was proper backpacking and staying in hostel dorms. From Mexico, I made my way all the way down to Argentina where I then took a cruise to Antarctica and back. This was probably the portion of the trip where I was in my most backpacker/homeless like state and usually booking things night before/day of. My hair was growing longer, I was wearing bracelets, and I was on a consistent diet of rice and beans. I spent roughly 6 months in Latin America. My first reaction upon landing in Mexico was f\*\*\* I need to learn Spanish. I didn‚Äôt take any Spanish lessons, but spending so much time in Latin America and actively trying to converse and navigate the region forced me to pick it up. By the end of those 6 months I knew enough Spanish for travel and friend purposes which was a very pleasant surprise.

**Africa**: The next logical step after South America was to continue my journey eastwards, bringing me to all of our‚Äôs collective motherland. I started in Johannesburg where I was staying with a couchsurfing host who ran a BnB business, and my fellow paying guests were apparently diamond dealers. I then made my way up to Kenya via overland tour. It was a massive relief to not have to plan for 3 weeks, and despite sleeping with bugs, sporadic showers and being bitten alive by mozzies, the people I met and wildlife was amazing.

**Middle East**: Following Africa, I quickly made my way through Qatar and Jordan to enter Turkey. I wish I had spent more time exploring the Middle East, but most Middle Eastern countries were either too expensive or presented too much visa difficulty. I visited Jordan at the beginning of 2024, so there weren‚Äôt a lot of tourists. Nevertheless, I felt completely safe and it was nice to explore Petra without the usual tourist crowd. I did get stranded in Jordan when I ‚Äúhitchhiked‚Äù my way to the Dead Sea and was just dropped off at a random spot. Luckily I bumped into a group of older travellers (50+) who took me under their wing for the next 2 days before I made my own way down to Petra.

**Europe**: From Turkey, I launched into Europe and completed my Euro Spring. It was very nice to be back in the western hemisphere and more modern touristy destinations, though that novelty quickly wore off. While I was used to cheap and great hostels in Latin America (mostly), hostels in Europe felt soulless and too expensive for what it was. Fortunately I had/made a lot of European friends who I ended up visiting/crashing with. I spent about 2 months in Central/Western Europe, and 1 month in Eastern Europe/Balkans. It was definitely nice catching up with friends that I had made during the earlier legs of my trip and seeing them again.

**Asia**: From Eastern Europe, I flew to Azerbaijan (not much to see) and then into Kazakhstan and Mongolia. I then launched my way into East Asia and South East Asia for the remaining 6 months of my trip. I basically ate my way through Asia and continued catching up with friends and seeing unbelievable sights. At this point, it had been over a year since I had any good Asian food, and my excitement and anticipation was immeasurable.

**Australia**: Before returning back home, I visited Perth for the first time and went skydiving and saw quokkas. 10/10.",comment_1,r/solotravel,Comedy,,https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1ktisuj/rtw_trip_report_532_days_7_continents_65_countries/

"Trip report: India Hi everyone,

I‚Äôd like to share my experience from a solo trip to India, which I took in September 2024.
I had been mentally preparing for this journey for several years, and I must say that I was surprised at every turn. I traveled from Jaipur to Agra, then to Gwalior, and finished my trip in Delhi. I spent around 11 days exploring these cities, using only tuk-tuks, trains, and walking‚ÄîI walked over 200 kilometers! I planned most of the trip with the help of ChatGPT and by asking fellow travelers for recommendations.

I flew from Dubai to Jaipur and, as a solo European guy on a fully booked flight, I definitely stood out‚Äîsome people did a triple take when they saw me, which was pretty funny. I arrived at Jaipur airport around 4 AM, and security staff unexpectedly escorted me straight to passport and visa control.

That morning, my walking journey across the city began.
Jaipur, also known as the ""Amber City,"" is beautiful but incredibly dirty‚Äîa fact I later realized is fairly standard across many Indian cities. Most people I met tried to lure me into their jewelry shops, workshops, or clothing stores. Walking through the city and its slums was fascinating, with countless places worth visiting.

One memorable moment happened when a random tuk-tuk driver‚Äîlet‚Äôs call him Srini‚Äîstopped and offered me a free ride, saying he just wanted to chat. Eventually, he invited me to his home. It was hard to refuse such a unique opportunity, so I agreed. I got a firsthand look at daily life in the slums‚Äîa truly eye-opening experience. Navigating the maze-like alleys was surreal. His ""house"" was a small 3x3m room, housing an unknown number of people.

Srini then called over his kids, who brought out musical instruments and began playing Indian music and singing. It was enjoyable‚Äîuntil they started asking for money. Specifically, they asked for 3000 rupees to buy a small sound system to support their musical ambitions. I declined several times, and eventually, Srini accepted it and took me back to the city. I gave him around 300 rupees and said goodbye.

Later, I booked a local guide via Showaround. It was a good experience, although, as expected, he took me to his family‚Äôs clothing store. We explored the city on his motorcycle, which was fun‚Äîuntil I made a rookie mistake. When getting off the bike, I accidentally burned my calf badly on the exhaust pipe. To this day, I have a 6 cm scar as a souvenir.

A few days later, I arrived in Agra‚Äîa city clearly geared toward tourists, for good reason. The Taj Mahal is absolutely breathtaking. I highly recommend arriving at opening time to avoid the crowds. After three hours there, I searched for good viewpoints on Google Maps. On my way back from one of them, I took what looked like a shortcut through a residential area. That turned out to be a mistake.

A man with bloodshot eyes and a machete blocked my path and demanded 300 rupees to cross his land. I paid without hesitation. The next day, while walking through other parts of Agra, I saw people living in conditions worse than anything I‚Äôd ever witnessed‚Äîlike animals. Tuk-tuk drivers were begging to give rides for as little as 10 rupees. In front of the Agra Fort, official guides started at 1500 rupees and dropped to 200 by the time I walked away. It was quite a scene.

Next, I arrived in Gwalior‚Äîa beautiful and underrated city. There‚Äôs an impressive hilltop fort with several temples, where you‚Äôre free to roam. I also visited the Gurudwara Data Bandi Chhod Sahib. Don‚Äôt hesitate to go inside‚Äîit was a once-in-a-lifetime experience. After visiting the temple, I was offered a simple but delicious free meal. Later in the local market, I bought some handmade metal dishes.

That same day, I saw a dead body covered in flies on the street, and no one seemed to care.

The final five days of my trip were spent in Delhi. I was surprised by how clean the city center was‚Äîbut beyond that, daily life looked very different. In my opinion, more than two days in Delhi isn't necessary.

Some useful tips:

Language:
I was genuinely surprised by how many people spoke English fluently and were easy to understand.

Prices:
They vary depending on your skin color and language skills. As a Czech traveler, I was always quoted the highest prices. For example, the entrance to the Taj Mahal cost me 1100 rupees, while locals paid only 50.

Transportation:
I used Uber everywhere. For trains, the IRCTC website worked well, though verifying your account requires patience.

Street Food:
It depends on your gut‚ÄîI ate street food almost daily and had no issues.

Internet:
I bought an eSIM via the Airalo app. It worked perfectly throughout the trip.

Common scams and things to watch out for:

Jewelry shops pretending to offer ""free tours""

Clothing stores with aggressive upselling

Tuk-tuk/Uber drivers lying about blocked accounts or demanding cash after the payment via card

Fake charity donations (blind children, etc.)

Claims about closed attractions to reroute you

Agra ‚Äì Mehtab Bagh: for the best photo, go straight to the ""Taj View Point ADA""

Overpriced official tour guides

Fake hotel/hostel photos on Booking.com ‚Äì always verify via Google Maps

Overly friendly strangers ‚Äì they usually have an agenda",post,r/solotravel,Comedy,91.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1ktdqgc/trip_report_india/
"> Prices: They vary depending on your skin color and language skills. As a Czech traveler, I was always quoted the highest prices. For example, the entrance to the Taj Mahal cost me 1100 rupees, while locals paid only 50.

lol come on now. For the Taj Mahal or other attractions it has nothing to do with skin color or language. It's just the official prices set by the government for locals vs foreigners, which obviously aren't negotiable. You can easily buy the tickets online too.

Also, a lot of the sites have official prices for tour guides listed on a sign by the entrance. Of the top of my head I saw them at the Red Fort and Humayun's Tomb in Delhi, and the Amber Palace in Jaipur. I imagine other places have them too. I thought that was pretty cool and wish more countries would adopt this.

India can be rather intense, extremely loud and dirty, but I have to say I actually didn't find it too bad in terms of scams or tourist vs. local prices compared to most poorer countries I've been to. And regardless, if you're from a richer country India is extremely cheap no matter how much you pay. For example, if you don't want to take the train from Agra to Delhi you can just hire an outstation cab from Uber or other apps/websites to drive you for 4 hours and 200km for 2000-3000 rupees (‚Ç¨20-30).",comment_1,r/solotravel,Comedy,,https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1ktdqgc/trip_report_india/

this is just normal, and it's not just at the Taj Mahal. they have foreigner price and local price. it's because foreigners can easily afford to pay more but they don't want to price out locals. this is all official, there are signs everywhere, there's separate queues. 

frankly this is a ridiculous thing to complain about",comment_2,r/solotravel,Comedy,,https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1ktdqgc/trip_report_india/

We were so annoyed and unsure because we had an itinerary planned. Anyway this guy kept looking at us in a friendly manor, eventually he came over. Turned out to be a doctor, took us off the train, straight to the box office booked us on another train ( in two days time) which was the earliest with availability, paid for it without us seeing and then wouldn‚Äôt accept any money. He then rang his friend who brought a car round, picked us up took us to a nice hotel, we paid for the hotel. And then for two days he met us everyday on bikes and showed us around gwalior, we met all their families, local spots, went out, the works. Amazing hospitality. We made sure to pay for as much as possible but it was honestly difficult with the traveller/god religious beliefs. We chatted still for years but he hasn‚Äôt responded for a while.

"Solo travel (34m) Miami - 05-23 to 05-26.  Need review and suggestions Solo Travel (m34) to Miami

I am doing a solo trip to Miami starting today. About to reach in 2 hours. I live in Chicago and wanted to just have a getaway for the long weekend. 

Travel dates: 05/23 to 05/26
Staying at a  freehand miami hostel in Miami Beach
This is my first solo trip. I have a budget of $1000 apart from stay and flight ticket. I like making friends and I am pretty laid back. Like nature and good food. 

I am planning to

Day 1(05/24): drive to key west. Leave from miami beach at 8am and back by 8pm. On the way stop at wild bird sanctuary

Day 2(05/25): Drive to little Havana at 8am, then walk around the coconut groove neighborhood, bike from surfside to miami south beach

Day 3(05/26): Art deco, and leave Miami by 12pm


I have few questions:

1. Is the itinerary good ? Should I stay overnight at Key west ? Have heard that going and coming back same day is little of a stretch.  
2. Any good events that are good for solo travelers for Day 0(05/23) today. I will reach south beach at 9pm !!
2. Any good places around miami (within 30-60 min drive) you‚Äôd recommend me ?
3. How expensive is parking ? Any cheap parking around freehand miami ?

Thanks in advance.",post,r/solotravel,Comedy,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1ktther/solo_travel_34m_miami_0523_to_0526_need_review/
"Trip Cork Just got back from a few days exploring County Cork and honestly, I‚Äôm still processing it all. It‚Äôs one of those places that doesn‚Äôt just impress you with scenery‚Äîit actually gets under your skin a bit. I went in with no strict plan, just a loose idea of where I wanted to wander, and Cork turned out to be the perfect match for that kind of trip.

I started in Cork city, spent the first day walking through the English Market, grabbing fresh bread, cheese, and local stuff for an impromptu lunch in Fitzgerald Park. Later I stumbled into a side street full of murals and ended up in a pub with live traditional music that just‚Ä¶ happened. Nothing staged, nothing touristy. Just real life.

Then I rented a car and headed south to Kinsale, which honestly looks like a postcard‚Äîcolorful houses, tiny shops, sea breeze everywhere. I walked up to Charles Fort and just sat there, watching the ocean and listening to the wind hit the walls. It was one of those moments where you don‚Äôt check your phone for a long while.

The Beara Peninsula was next, and that‚Äôs where things really shifted. I took a slightly off-the-main-road route that ran through tiny towns and winding mountain passes. One night I stayed at a rural B&B right by the sea‚Äîno Wi-Fi, no phone signal, just crashing waves and stars. Felt like time stopped for a bit.

I also made it to Mizen Head at sunset. Standing on that bridge with the Atlantic below me and no one else around was surreal. The light, the silence, the rawness of it all‚Äîit felt like the edge of the world. Later that evening I found this little seafood place someone had mentioned offhand, with no sign outside, just locals and the best fish I‚Äôve had in a long time.

One thing that really helped shape the trip: I came across this interactive map/guide before leaving. Not a generic blog, but something that felt put together by someone who‚Äôd actually been there. It had mapped routes‚Äîdriving, biking, hiking‚Äîwith real notes and suggestions. I found some incredible places thanks to it, ones I‚Äôd never have thought to search for. It even lets you filter the type of routes depending on how you want to explore. Super useful if you want something beyond the typical top 10 lists.

I didn‚Äôt see everything, but I *felt* Cork. And that‚Äôs more than enough. If you‚Äôre thinking of going: leave space for spontaneity, follow paths that aren‚Äôt on the usual apps, talk to locals, and if you can, look for maps that feel a bit more ‚Äúlived in.‚Äù That‚Äôs what made all the difference for me.",post,r/solotravel,Comedy,0.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1ktrtv1/trip_cork/

"10 week Southeast Asia Itinerary - thoughts? Hey,

I'm planning on a 10 week Southeast Asia solo trip this summer. I'm trying to plan and there's so much I want to do. It definitely feels like I'll be cramming in a lot, but I don't want to remove any countries. What do you think of the plan so far? I wasn't sure of how many days to spend in each country. Would you make any adjustments based on your experiences?

**Thailand - 14 days**

* Bangkok, Ayutthaya, Chiang Mai, Chiang Rai, Pai

**Laos - 8 days**

* Luang Prabang, Vang Vieng, 4000 Islands

**Cambodia - 6 days**

* Phnom Penh, Siam Reap

**Indonesia - 12 days**

* Bali, Gili, Java, (Lombok?)

**Borneo - 14 days**

* Kota Kinabalu, Sepilok, Kinabatangan River, Danum Valley

**Singapore - 2 days**

**Malaysia - 14 days**

* Kuala Lumpar, Penang, Cameron Islands, Langkawi",post,r/solotravel,Comedy,3.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1ktevzu/10_week_southeast_asia_itinerary_thoughts/
"For just the north and center of Thailand, this is fine. It's a shame you're missing out on the south though.

4000 islands is not worth it if you're not doing anything else in Laos, but I assume your planning on taking a nigh bus and stopping on the way to Cambodia. That's fine but its probably easier to just fly.

I don't really think the Indonesia part is enough time. I'd probably drop the Gili's if I were you.

Can't speak on Borneo, I haven't been.

Singapore is worth more than 2 days.

Two weeks is good for Peninsular Malaysia, but I feel like you'd be better off shortening that time a bit and adding the extra days elsewhere.

IMO it's too much in too little time overall, but if you're comfortable with seeing a half or a third of what each country has to offer and missing out on a good portion of the sights it's okay.",comment_1,r/solotravel,Comedy,,https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1ktevzu/10_week_southeast_asia_itinerary_thoughts/

"Personally I'd skip Cambodia and spend that time doing the Thakhek Loop in Laos. I wouldn't spend much time in Bangkok personally, and fyi Ayutthaya can be done in a day trip. I agree that the south of Thailand is mostly skippable (though I am not a beach person), though Khao Sok National Park was quite beautiful.

I spent like two days in Kuala Lumpur and that was enough for me. I didn't find it very different than Singapore, though maybe slightly cheaper.

No Vietnam? That was probably my favorite country in SEA. Liked it way better than Thailand and even a bit better than Laos.

"Malaysia/ Phuket itinerary advice Hi, looking for some critique of my 30 day trip from mid June to mid July. I‚Äôm mid-20s female and going solo from the UK. I enjoy trying foods, sightseeing (in cities more so than nature since I‚Äôm alone) and scuba diving (I have an open water PADI). 

My main doubt about this itinerary is the number of flights I‚Äôm taking because they can be quite tiring including all the security hassle. Albeit they are all quite short flights. They seem necessary between Penang > Langkawi > Phuket > Perhentian (via KL so two flights) > KK (via KL) > KL to fly home. Priority would be to keep a good diving spot and place to see some wildlife. Also feel like Penang is a must because I love Malaysian food! Phuket is included because I‚Äôve never been to Thailand and thought it‚Äôs a good opportunity to get a glimpse whilst I‚Äôm nearby. 

Is there somewhere I should skip or spend less /more time in. I‚Äôm intentionally avoiding the east cost of Sabah as unfortunately it is still against my government‚Äôs advice to travel there. I‚Äôve only just booked the flights so not entirely sure what I‚Äôll be doing in each place so any activity suggestions would be great please. This is what I‚Äôm come up with based on previous Reddit posts/blogs:

KL 4 nights
Malacca 2 nights
Ipoh 2 nights
Cameron highlands 2 nights
Penang 4 nights 
Langkawi 3 nights 
Phuket 5 nights
Perhentian islands 4 nights
Kota Kinabalu 4 nights

- arrive to Barcelona via cruise ship at noon, drop off carry on luggage somewhere in the city center

- bum around the city, chill/sleep at a day use hotel

- Arrive at airport at 21:00, drop off back pack and carry on at EXCESS BAGGAGE facility

- fly to Ibiza at 23:20. 

**June 30**

- arrive to Ibiza 00:25, dance the night away at Pacha to SOLOMUN!!!!! 

- Leave Pacha @ 05:00, fly back to Barcelona @ 07:00

- Grab luggage, fly to Madrid

- Does the Ibiza airport offer valuables storage? Don‚Äôt really wanna take my passport to the clurb.

"Finally Taking a 2.5-Month Sabbatical in Asia ‚Äì Looking for Deeper, Local Travel Ideas (Not the Usual Tourist Stops) Hey everyone! I‚Äôm an American passport holder in my early 30s, and after years of thinking about it, I finally pulled the trigger‚Äîquit my job and booked a 2.5-month sabbatical to travel through Asia. It‚Äôs been a dream of mine since I was a kid, and I‚Äôm finally in a position (time-wise and financially) to make it happen.

This will actually be my fifth time in Asia, but it‚Äôs the first time I‚Äôll be doing an extended trip there. Most of my past visits were shorter (1‚Äì2 weeks max), and I stuck to the usual highlights‚ÄîTokyo, Seoul, Bangkok, Hanoi, etc. This time I want something different. I‚Äôm less interested in checking boxes and more into immersing myself‚Äîslow travel, local experiences, and places that don‚Äôt show up in every top 10 list.

I have a budget of around $15k‚Äì$20k USD, not including flights to and from Asia. I‚Äôm mostly traveling solo and love walking cities, trying street food, talking to locals, and getting a little lost. Big fan of local markets, neighborhood cafes, community events, and just observing daily life. I‚Äôm open to all kinds of experiences, from coastal towns and smaller cities to regional festivals and more niche cultural scenes.

Tentative route (not fully locked in but likely):
	‚Ä¢	South Korea (probably Seoul + somewhere smaller like Jeonju or Gyeongju)
	‚Ä¢	China (curious about Yunnan province or some second/third-tier cities, open to ideas)
	‚Ä¢	Japan (already done Tokyo/Kyoto/Osaka ‚Äî maybe looking into Kyushu or Tohoku region?)
	‚Ä¢	Thailand (thinking Chiang Mai, but wondering if there are even quieter alternatives)
	‚Ä¢	Vietnam (loved Hanoi last time ‚Äî maybe Da Lat or Ha Giang?)
	‚Ä¢	Brunei (no clue what to expect here, just curious)
	‚Ä¢	Indonesia (open to lesser-known islands beyond Bali and Java)
	‚Ä¢	Cambodia (did Siem Reap last time, wondering about Kampot or Battambang)

My questions for the group:
	1.	What lesser-known cities, towns, or regions really surprised you in any of these countries?
	2.	Are there any local events, seasonal festivals, or experiences worth planning around?
	3.	If you‚Äôve done something similar, how did you balance spontaneity vs. pre-booking?
	4.	Any advice on connecting with locals in a way that goes beyond the surface-level?

Thanks in advance to anyone who takes the time to reply. I‚Äôve done quite a bit of research already, but I know the best tips usually come from fellow travelers who‚Äôve been there and done it.

I think u should spend more time in each country - going in and out of each country will exhaust u esp if u have only 2.5 months and a plan to hit that many cities. If it was me I'd only pick max 3 to 4 countries and explore more cities in each place.

if you're dead set on seeing the Taj Mahal, sure why not. Would I do it? probably not.

I don't think you'll spend a month in Laos or Cambodia unless you find more places you find interesting. Which obviously could happen if someone tells you about some cool place they went to and you wanna go (e.g. Don Det). good to have a buffer

"3 weeks in Ecuador or Colombia for hiking/photography? (1st time backpacking in South America) Hey everyone! As you can tell from the title I am planning my first trip (solo dolo) to South America for July of this year and would like some perspective from people who have been to either Colombia and/or Ecuador.

Some background about me - I'm 24M and am conversational in Spanish (B2ish) and really enjoy hiking, city/nature photography and experiencing the local culture when I travel. I also enjoy talking with locals and exploring small towns (maybe this isn't as feasible for this trip though). I have done some backpacking throughout Western/Eastern Europe and Japan/Korea so I'm not completely new to backpacking, I'm just new to South America. I wouldn't say no to going out and partying but I'm not necessarily seeking that out or making it a priority.

Budget - trying to keep moderately low and mainly sticking to hostels but I'm willing to pay for experiences here and there. 

Which place in your opinion would be the best option for me and my interests? Also any thoughts on the saftey situation in both places? Also is 3 weeks too much for Ecuador/Colombia? I was considering 2 weeks there and 1 week in Mexico City but I live in Texas so Mexico City isn't that hard to get to.

I just finished backpacking South America and I spent 6 weeks in Colombia and 5 weeks in Ecuador. I think Ecuador has crazier hiking and stuff but for first time in South America I think Colombia is better. You can still find snowy peaks and great hiking but I find the culture and vibe to be way more fun in Colombia. Also when I traveled Ecuador there wasn‚Äôt many other travelers so it did get somewhat lonely in the hostels.,comment_4,r/solotravel,Comedy,,https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1kt9cq2/3_weeks_in_ecuador_or_colombia_for/
"Wish I'd Discovered Hostels Sooner ‚Äì A Little Reflection from a 30-something. 
I'm currently preparing for my third hostel trip, and I can't help but reflect on how much I wish I'd discovered this style of travel in my 20s.

Backstory: I spent my teens and early 20s in the army, living a very structured life and always around people (barracks, deployments, etc). So when I left, holidays meant one thing‚Äîspace.

 I'd book hotels, keep to myself, and just decompress. Nothing wrong with that... but I now realise how much I missed out on by not embracing hostels earlier.

On a whim a while back, I decided to try a hostel while travelling solo. Thought, ‚ÄúI've done the shared living thing before, how bad can it be?‚Äù Turned out‚Äîit wasn't bad. It was brilliant. 

The connections, random conversations, shared meals, last-minute plans with strangers who become mates... it‚Äôs honestly been a game-changer. And it's a fraction of the cost too.

If anyone's hesitant or thinks hostels are just for gap year students and 20-year-old backpackers‚Äîdon‚Äôt rule it out. I‚Äôve met all ages, backgrounds, and stories in these places. Whether you're looking to socialise or just save money while having a base, it‚Äôs totally worth a shot.

Just wanted to share for anyone on the fence or feeling ""too old"" to try something new.

Would love to hear if anyone else had a late-in-life hostel epiphany?",post,r/solotravel,Comedy,244.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1ks8xk6/wish_id_discovered_hostels_sooner_a_little/

"Help! Please check my 44-day Peru & Bolivia itinerary starting next week ‚Äì and answer a few key questions! I‚Äôm flying to Peru this Sunday (May 25) and planning to travel for about six weeks through both Peru and Bolivia. I haven‚Äôt booked most things yet because I wasn‚Äôt sure how I‚Äôd react to the altitude and jet lag, so I thought I‚Äôd just figure it out along the way, like I did last year in Mexico.

But now I‚Äôm realising this is peak season, and I keep hearing that everything needs to be booked early ‚Äì so I‚Äôm getting nervous.

Of course I want to see Machu Picchu, but I didn‚Äôt buy a ticket in advance. I‚Äôm hoping to join a last-minute Salkantay Trek, and from what I read, it might still be possible to queue up for a Machu Picchu ticket at Aguas Calientes if I‚Äôm lucky. Has anyone done that recently? Is it still possible in 2025, or have the rules changed?

Also ‚Äì I‚Äôm not a super experienced hiker, but I keep hearing that Salkantay is the must-do trek. Most tours I‚Äôve seen are 5 days. Are there shorter or easier options (e.g. 4 days or even 2-3 days)? How much do those cost usually? And if I join last minute, do they help organise the Machu Picchu ticket and the trip to Aguas Calientes for me?

Some people also told me to just skip the trek and take the train to Machu Picchu as a one-day visit. I‚Äôm torn ‚Äì what do you think is the best experience overall, especially if I‚Äôm not a hardcore hiker but still want something meaningful?

‚∏ª

Here are a few other questions I‚Äôd love your input on:
	
‚Ä¢	Huaraz or not? Some people suggest going from Lima directly to Huaraz for high-altitude treks like Laguna 69, but I haven‚Äôt included it in my itinerary. Is it worth the detour and effort (right at the beginning of the trip)? Or is it too intense to do right after landing, especially during winter?

‚Ä¢	Bus vs flights: I planned to travel mostly by bus ‚Äì is that okay? Or would you recommend taking more domestic flights instead?

‚Ä¢	Bolivia timing: I‚Äôve only left 8 days for Bolivia. Is that enough, or should I rearrange and go to Bolivia earlier in the trip?

‚Ä¢	Return from Bolivia: Should I end the trip in Bolivia and fly back to Lima from La Paz, instead of circling back to Peru again?
	
‚Ä¢	Vaccines: I haven‚Äôt had the yellow fever shot. Is it okay with my current itinerary?
	

‚Ä¢	Season & weather: Are there any places I should skip or swap, given it‚Äôs winter? Any legs of the trip that feel too rushed or too slow?

‚∏ª

I‚Äôd be super grateful for any advice, suggestions, or thoughts ‚Äì especially from those who‚Äôve done parts of this route!

"Why don't you just do all your Peru first, and then move onto Bolivia? You could go Huacachina to Cusco, acclimate there a couple days and go to a shop like MP Reservations for last minute inexpensive Salkantay (includes MP ticket and stay in Aquas Calientes before MP). Then after this go to Arequipa, Titicaca, La Paz, etc.",comment_1,r/solotravel,Comedy,,https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1kt0xwk/help_please_check_my_44day_peru_bolivia_itinerary/
"> ‚Ä¢ Bolivia timing: I‚Äôve only left 8 days for Bolivia. Is that enough, or should I rearrange and go to Bolivia earlier in the trip?

Depends on what you want to do. It is nowhere near enough to see even a fraction of the country. You could spend your entire 44 day trip in Bolivia and still have things left to do. But if all you want to do is the 3 day salt flats tour, a couple of days in la paz and a day in Copacabana then sure. IMO 8 days is not much time, I'd say 2 weeks is a better number, but I'm a bit biased.

Bear in mind that it pays to be flexible in Bolivia, it's not uncommon for road blocks to spring up over night and when that happens it can often mean the entire country grinds to a halt. Given the economic situation and the upcoming elections it is not implausible that you'll end up stuck somewhere for a day or longer.

> ‚Ä¢ Bus vs flights: I planned to travel mostly by bus ‚Äì is that okay? Or would you recommend taking more domestic flights instead?

Travelling by bus is fine, it might help if you spoke some Spanish, but you can get by without it. But bear in mind many journeys are going to be overnight and you may not sleep that well. Buses can get pretty cold at night so you might want to pick up a blanket or two to travel with once you arrive.

> ‚Ä¢ Season & weather: Are there any places I should skip or swap, given it‚Äôs winter? Any legs of the trip that feel too rushed or too slow?

The salt flats can get down to about -15C at night during the winter, it'll be warm in the day though, but pack for cold weather at night. Other places, especially those at altitude will also got pretty cold at night.

> ‚Ä¢ Vaccines: I haven‚Äôt had the yellow fever shot. Is it okay with my current itinerary?

I think so. There are countries that require it as an entry requirement but neither Peru nor Bolivia did (last I checked), and while Bolivia and maybe peru have some areas with a risk of yellow fever, they are not likely to be places you are going. But all this info (border requirements and risk zones) are available online so do some research to be safe.",comment_2,r/solotravel,Comedy,,https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1kt0xwk/help_please_check_my_44day_peru_bolivia_itinerary/
"It seems like you have lots of time in Cusco. You can probably find stuff to do, but you may want to switch a Cusco day for Lima at the end. Cruz del Sur is a really comfortable and safe bus company in Peru, but they don't go from Puno to La Paz. For that part, I recommend Boliviahop. Traveling within Peru, though, Cruz del Sur is much more affordable. If you're not a big hiker, I wouldn't make your first stop Huaraz. Adjust to the altitude at least three days first. You adjust your itinerary for Arequipa if you need to do the Salkantay trek at a different time. You can do the Arequipa part on the way to Cusco or on the way to Puno/Lake Titicaca. You probably won't need a yf shot for that part of Bolivia but there are also places in Lima where you can get the shot for 50-60 dollars.

"If it helps - we lined for Machu Picchu tickets at Aguas Calientes last year. Basically we got there early morning, lined up and got tickets for the next day, hung out around the town (not a bad place, very touristy vibes but it was chill), went up to MP the next morning and got back to Cuzco by night. 

The ticketing had some complications - IIRC we had to line up early to get a time slot, *then* came back later to actually get the tickets and pay. We did have a local tour guide helping us (as he was going to be our tour guide for MP the next day anyways), but I think it was very doable solo.",comment_5,r/solotravel,Comedy,,https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1kt0xwk/help_please_check_my_44day_peru_bolivia_itinerary/

"Oaxaca for Dia De Los Muertos this year Hi all! I am a solo traveler (F30s) planning to travel to Mexico for a little over a month this October-November, and while I have several stops planned for various reasons, the one place and occasion I'd love to have more input and conversation with my fellow solo travelers about is Oaxaca for Dia de los muertos! I know this a popular occasion that I've seen so many travelers talking about their plans for and sharing trip reports for in just about every travel community I belong to over the years...so I figured I'd open up the conversation here to hopefully become the main sharing hub for any solo travelers like myself that are planning to do Dia de los muertos in Oaxaca (or Mexico, in general!) this year to share and converse and plan their journeys for 2025! ‚ú®Ô∏èü´∂

I was debating between Mexico City and Oaxaca- and I even considered Merida, as I'll be heading there right after Oaxaca, but ultimately it didn't seem like there's much of a large scale celebration in Merida, specifically, based on my research thus far- but it seems like Oaxaca is more aligned with my vibe for this celebration, specifically. I'm thinking of staying in Oaxaca for about a week total, from October 30/31 through November 5th or 6th. 

The biggest piece of planning I'm struggling with is WHERE exactly to stay in Oaxaca that will be within 15-20 minute walking/or short (5-10 minute) cab rides away from the heary of all the main celebrations, as I won't have a car (and being from New York City, I'm very comfortable and used to walking several miles in a day, no problem at all). 

One thing I'm really looking forward to doing is joining a local workshop or otherwise learning how to make an ofrenda, as I'll be honoring/celebrating my parents who both passed away this past year- so I'd love to stay somewhere that's in the cultural heart of it all, where I can fully immerse myself in the experience of honoring deceased loved ones and make meaningful connections with other people doing the same. On a lighter note, I'm also very into the idea of donning a butterfly costume for some sort of party or parade, as I've always loved the symbolism of butterflies as they pertain to personal growth and transformation, and I know they're a popular symbol during Dia de los muertos as well, which I'm very excited about! ü¶ã 


I look forward to any and all replies, trip reports, tips/tricks, and input to the conversation! I can't wait to hear about what everyone else is planning as well, and hope this thread will help others in the planning stages for this fall! ‚ú®Ô∏è üíõ",post,r/solotravel,Comedy,2.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1ksy4p9/oaxaca_for_dia_de_los_muertos_this_year/

I strongly suggest staying somewhere walkable over Uber-able. Trying to get anywhere by car when festivities kick off can be miserable. Go to Google Maps and find Zocalo in Oaxaca (the main square); imagine this as the bottom left of a rectangle. Now find the ADO bus station; that's your top right. Now take that rectangle and expand it in all directions by about about 3-5 blocks. Aim to stay somewhere inside of that rectangle. 

>I'm thinking of staying in Oaxaca for about a week total, from October 30/31 through November 5th or 6th.

One of the biggest performance parades is the evening of the 30th, so I would definitely aim to be there for that. If I were to go again, I'd probably aim to arrive on the evening of the 29th, but the 30th is fine too.

The only reason I even included the ""5-10 minute car ride"" distance caveat is in case there's one or 2 specific, absolute can't miss events that happen to lie outside of the main hub where everything else takes place.

So, that all being said, what would you do? What do you wish you would have done? I‚Äôm open to any and all suggestions, down for whatever. Not the biggest sight-seeer, more out here for the experience. I love driving, never been camping but completely would, etc.

Last year I traveled in Europe, spend a semester in Stockholm, then traveled mostly solo to Barcelona, Amsterdam, Budapest, drove across Ibiza, drove Roma to Milan and spent a little time in Berlin. I love meeting people at hostels, airports or randomly, love driving or traveling by bike/whatever weird way.¬†

This trip I hope to do more detached from modern society. I was thinking of not bringing/using a smartphone, but ultimately brought one and a cheap laptop to book transport with.

So essay over, here‚Äôs my current idea, traveling from now until early August. Budget $3000/mo (less ideally)

May 27-June 11

Hochimin city to Nah Trang loop (with 3 friends, rest solo)

June 11-18

Try and make it HCMC to Cambodia to bangkok hitchhiking/trains/scooter

June 18-July 10

A lot of time in India solo, no fixed places yet

Goa

New Delhi

Hrishikesh

Madurai

Srinagar

July 10-14

Maybe Poland to see a friend

July 15-28

Berlin for festival

July 28-Aug 4

Marseille

Cherbourg, France

Aug 4-12

Sail to London from Cherbourg, then fly from London to NYC

"The solo travel Latin America autumn/winter conundrum - aka ""Escaping freezing Buenos Aires"". Without spending an absolute fortune on one way flight, where can I go from BA that fills my criteria? Here's 4 I have so far that look solo travel friendly .... I've been solo in Buenos Aires for a few months now, but the weather has turned to shit - it was 9 degrees Celsius this morning!

I'm looking for somewhere that's warm (**at least 20 degrees Celsius**), sunny, and dry from late May/early June onwards in Latin America. 

Plan is to base myself in one place for about 4 weeks as I work online.

**Flight Budget:**

I'm trying not to spend more than circa $350 USD on the one-way flight from Buenos Aires.

**Must-Haves:**

It needs to be solo-travel friendly: this means generally safe, easy to navigate, and with friendly locals.

Good infrastructure is essential: I absolutely need reliable WiFi for work. Also looking for a good range of accommodation options, easy local transportation, and access to daily amenities 

For my daily budget, I'm aiming for a max of $60 USD on regular days. For accommodation, ideally around $30 USD for a private room in a guesthouse/budget Airbnb or similar.

**The Vibe & Activities I'm After:**

1 - My main way to exercise and explore is long-distance walking, so places with decent paths are a must (e.g., good city sidewalks, park loops, coastal promenades).

2 - I love checking out local markets, especially night food markets

3 - I'm interested in local culture like street art, hearing live music, or finding artisan crafts.

3 - I‚Äôd be open to casually improving my Spanish 

4 - I enjoy a vibrant atmosphere with good cafes and restaurants.

5 - Definitely NO nightlife or party scene focus ‚Äì I don't drink alcohol.

6 - Also not looking for strenuous stuff like dedicated hiking trails, cycling, or water sports - it‚Äôs not my thing

**Beach Town Thoughts:**

A beach town setting would be a nice bonus and great for walks, but the other factors above are the priority

**Avoiding a destination's wet season as much as possible**

This is a pain in the ass at this time of year in many Latin America destinations - but I'm really trying to avoid places where it rains for hours every day 
 

**Places I've Considered:**

I've done some preliminary research, and places like Lima (Peru), Iquique (Chile), and Asunci√≥n (Paraguay) came up. Cura√ßao also looks interesting, but flights from BA seem higher.

Re: Lima though, some are saying it‚Äôs quite cold there now, in addition to the usual Lima heavy fog. Maybe it's a bad choice this time of year? 

**My Questions:**

1 - Given all these details, do any of my initially considered spots (Lima, Iquique, Asunci√≥n) sound like they could actually work for a 4-week solo stay / remote work base?

2 - Or, are there other Latin American destinations you'd strongly recommend that really nail this combination of weather, budget, infrastructure, and my specific interests?

To be honest, I‚Äôm looking for more new suggestions more than I‚Äôm looking for feedback on those 4 destinations 

None of the 4 really tick all the boxes

**Important Note:**

No Rio suggestions, please - I've already spent 3 months there and looking for somewhere new 

And re: Medell√≠n in Colombia: I definitely want to go there this year, but not during it's current wet season 

**And a ""PS"" on the $350 flight cost:**

I'm a bit flexible on this if the destination is really worth it 

Would love your feedback and any insights",post,r/solotravel,Comedy,23.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1kscvu1/the_solo_travel_latin_america_autumnwinter/

"I spent last year one and a half months in Paraguay, from July to August. The weather was nice in the beginning was raining a lot and it was windy, but from it was one week tops like that the rest it was all sun and good.

The city itself doesn't have a lot to do, but I've enjoyed staying there since I look for more chill cities. To give you an idea, it was a city with a lot of movement during the day but after 22:00 the whole city was quiet and you could hear crickets.

Buuut, if I'm honest, after two weeks I didn't find much more to do there. I went from Asuncion to Buenos Aires and it was really enjoyable but almost 24 hours in a bus.

And one huge important thing, there isn't a lot of flight leaving from Asuncion and they're expensive, so think it carefully your destination after Asuncion. Even for buses the only options to go to another country are Bolivia, Argentina and Brazil. And the bus to Bolivia take more than a whole days.",comment_3,r/solotravel,Comedy,,https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1kscvu1/the_solo_travel_latin_america_autumnwinter/

"Did you consider El Salvador? San Salvador has a ton of affordable spots to stay and theyve commissioned some good art to cover up graffiti and clean up the parks. It‚Äôs super super safe and you can uber around super cheap (drivers will give you their card so you can skip the app next time). El tunco (beach) is a bit is pretty calm during weekdays (weekend evenings are a huge party scene), and only 45 min from San Salvador - with super cheap buses all day. There are a ton of other small beach towns there that are much calmer. 
It IS the rainy season but they had a bad April, and all of May has been really fine with just a bit of clouds and a sprinkle or two in the afternoon or evening. 
On another thought, everyone I talked to in El Salvador goes on vacation to Guatemala - so I‚Äôd give that a look too! 
As for flight prices, I‚Äôve found flights there for about $280 recently.",comment_5,r/solotravel,Comedy,,https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1kscvu1/the_solo_travel_latin_america_autumnwinter/
"Solo trip (m36) sanctuary white sands cuba It's day 3 on my 5 day vacation to this all inclusive resort. This place is beautiful and the staff is very friendly. It's my first trip going solo and just needed some rnr. I know everyone experiences everything differently but for me it's a mix of highs and lows. I wanted to explore nearby towns so I asked how much it would to get a ride to the nearest one and they told me it would cost 200 US for a round trip so I obviously opted out and being stuck on the resort with no one to speak with definitely makes for a very lonely trip. I try my best to learn some spanish before speaking with the staff but im definitely finding it hard with the language barrier. 

So far my daily routines is waking up having some coffee and chain smoking cigarettes. Sitting by the pool or going for a swim on the beach. I try to occupy myself with the free wifi but I don't really scroll the web too much so I've just been day drinking all day and sitting around. Maybe it's just me I am an introvert and socializing has never been a strong point in my life.

At night I sit at the 24hour bar in the lobby and was shocked that there was never more than 8-10 people. I figured it was my best chance of socializing and having some drinks but it seems like over 90% of the people here are couples or small groups of friends that stick to themselves. I met one solo traveler and he was a good fella but he quickly went after the only other single female at the bar. Just to be clear it wasn't my intention to find tail on my vacation I was just looking to get away from the city and relax.

I know it would have been much better traveling with friends and I do want to come back just not alone. I'm not saying it's a bad thing to travel solo I just feel even more like an outcast when I see everyone socializing laughing and having a great time while I sit here kind of feeling like a loser.",post,r/solotravel,Comedy,0.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1kstr8h/solo_trip_m36_sanctuary_white_sands_cuba/

"Planning a trip to Budapest, any thoughts on my itinerary? I'm planning a solo trip to Budapest in July.

I plan to stay at a party hostel to meet other people. I'm still deciding between Onefam Budapest and Vitae Hostel. If anyone here has stayed at either hostels and could share their experience, that would be great!

This is my itinerary for Budapest as of right now:

Wednesday July 9:

* Depart from Toronto to Budapest at night

Thursday July 10:

* Arrive in Budapest in the afternoon
* Central Market Hall

Friday July 11:

* St. Stephen's Basilica

Saturday July 12:

* Heroes' Square
* Sz√©chenyi Thermal Bath

Sunday July 13:

* Fisherman's Bastion
* Castle District

Monday July 14:

* Sz√©chenyi Chain Bridge
* Buda Castle
* Varhegy

Tuesday July 15:

* Hungarian Parliament Building
* Shoes on the Danube Bank
* Legenda City Cruises (Budapest Danube River Sightseeing Night Cruise)

Wednesday July 16:

* Depart from Budapest back to Toronto in the afternoon

I plan to also go out every night as both hostels run daily pub crawls. I don't know if Vitae runs events during the day, but Onefam does so I'm planning to attend at least of their daytime events such as their walking tours.

Any thoughts on my itinerary? Good or bad? What would you change, replace, add, or remove from my itinerary? Which of these places should I buy tickets in advance? I remember when I went to Amsterdam last summer I had to buy my Anne Frank House ticket one month in advance. Also, what's the best metro pass to get to get around Budapest? In Lisbon, they have a Lisboa card where you can get up to three days of unlimited travel and free entry to some of the most popular museums/attractions like the Bel√©m Tower for a really good price.

"How do you organize your important travel documents? (Passports, insurance, medical info, etc.) Hey fellow travelers,

I keep running into the same headache over and over while traveling, and I‚Äôm wondering how you guys deal with it.

Things like my passport scan, travel insurance, emergency contact info, visa documents, booking confirmations, and even just notes about my allergies or blood type ‚Äî they all end up in different places: emails, cloud drives, photos, paper folders, random apps...

Then, when I actually need one of them (crossing a border, checking in, filing a claim, or find myself in an emergency situation abroad), it‚Äôs always a hassle trying to find what I need.

So I‚Äôm curious:

1.	How do you keep your important travel-related documents organized and accessible?

"Future travel hotspots? I was recently reading about the hippie trail and how major stops along that route included Afghanistan, Iran, Iraq, and Syria - essentially places that now don‚Äôt see tourism. I also was talking to my great aunt and she was telling me some of the destinations she visited back in her traveling heyday that were surprising to me as these wouldn‚Äôt be common tourist hotspots in todays day and age, but were popular back then.

It got me thinking about the reverse scenario - what destinations right now would you be fairly surprised/shocked if someone mentioned going there for tourism, but you see having potential for future tourism? I‚Äôve seen several posts talking about underrated destinations that may garner more popularity in the future, but they‚Äôre still currently somewhat traveled to destinations. Where right now has little to no tourism (whether it be due to conflict, safety, lack of tourism infrastructure, etc) but you believe could have potential for the future? It doesn‚Äôt have to be very plausible, just somewhat possible. For example, I think 10 years ago if someone mentioned they were going to Saudi Arabia‚Äôs for tourism it would be very surprising and invoke a lot of questions (if not impossible given they didn‚Äôt really open for tourism until more recently I think) but now it‚Äôs possible to go and we are seeing people travel there (or at least I‚Äôm seeing Instagram reels of new hotels and activities there, not sure what the numbers actually look like). Just an example I‚Äôm throwing out there, but I‚Äôm curious to see what this sub thinks about other possible future destinations that today you‚Äôd be very surprised if someone mentioned going to.",post,r/solotravel,Comedy,4.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1ksevkw/future_travel_hotspots/
"This question comes up quite often, and of course there are different views.

There are actually not many countries that see no tourists at all And there are a lot that see plenty!

Most of those that see very few, it's for specific reasons... nothing 
of 'mainstream  interest' to see, very difficult to get to, very small islands in the middle of nowhere, lack of infrastructure,war etc.And sometimes the political system, which can change of course.

Anyway! I'd say that it's tough to predict.Especially the political side... somewhere like Ukraine and Russia for example,who knows what the situation will be like there in ten years time? But they might once again be quite popular destinations.

Iraq and Syria might become more popular than now but I don't think they'll be mainstream tourist spots.

Another place where there could potentially be 'opening up'... Algeria.That country has a lot that could attract tourists,if the Algerian government actually wants them to come.

I'd say all of Europe is already fairly well touristed, and nearly all of Asia too.

Turkmenistan,if there is political change there?

Saudi Arabia that you mentioned is the one that is most likely to become a popular tourist destination I'd say, particularly with Muslim tourists but also Europeans to some extent...in the same way that Dubai or Abu Dhabi are now.",comment_1,r/solotravel,Comedy,,https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1ksevkw/future_travel_hotspots/

"Trip Report: Mexico City for Five Days I recently took a solo trip to Mexico City and wanted to share my activities in hope that they help others make the most of their trip there.  A few things to start off - this was my first time in Mexico, I speak little to no Spanish, I'm at 36M, and I don't really drink/party so my main goals for the trip were to explore the city, eat good food, hit coffee shops, see a few museums, and visit Teotihuac√°n.  Below is an outline of my trip.

Day 0:

Landed at MEX in the early afternoon.  Customs was quick, but getting out of the airport was a bit confusing.  I tried to walk to the local ""MetroBus"" train station but kept kind of going circles and ended up at the wrong train station, so I said screw it and ubered to my hostel.  I stayed at [Anys Hostal](https://www.hostelworld.com/hostels/p/42617/anys-hostal/) in the Roma Norte neighborhood and it was great for me - I paid for my own room & bathroom which I was more than I needed.  The room itself was huge and actually had three beds, not sure if I accidentally booked some family suite or what.  The place itself had very ""bed and breakfast"" vibes, there's even a little cafe on the main level.  Seemed to be family owned, everyone I interacted it with was super friendly, although only one spoke decent English.  After getting situated I hit the streets and grabbed a coffee at the nearby [Nice Day Cafe](https://www.nicedaymx.com/) \-  which was a very cool Japanese-themed spot.  I ended up going there like three times during my whole trip.  After that I mainly walked around Roma Norte.  I was blown away by just how many street food options there were, like literally every corner had at least one and they all smelled/looked good.  Ended up getting an early dinner at a Mexican restaurant called Santo Habanero, and then getting a little evening espresso at [Almanegra Cafe](https://almanegra.cafe/?srsltid=AfmBOop_tFxqa43zvOt99kgLYmkKetYarQ9OnOmAF5QkhCGKh85IMuce) (another great spot that I revisited and also bought beans from).

  
Day 1:

Main goal was the hit the National Anthropology Museum.  I'm not a breakfast person, so I took a walk to [Cardinal Cafe](https://www.instagram.com/casacardinal/?hl=en) (great local chain) for some coffee and then started walking to the area which most the museums are.  I could have used the bus, but it was a nice day and there was so much to look at so I just walked.  Ended up walking by some weed-related demonstration which interesting.  Eventually I got to the ""museum park"" area which was beautiful.  I was initially surprised at how wooded the area was, I didn't expect so much nature anywhere in CDMX.  Explored a few trails and then went to the National Anthropology Museum.  I did not buy tickets ahead of time and had no issue getting one, I got there not long after they opened though.  This museum was beyond excellent.  Probably one of the best museums I've been to ever.  I spent about four hours there, and I could've stayed longer.  There was so many things to look at, sections for different civilizations, it was honestly amazing.  Afterwards, went back to my room to shower/nap.  

That night, I said yolo and decided to go to a Lucha Libre event at the nearby arena.  Walking up to the event was a madhouse - a gazillion people/vendors wearing/selling the funny masks.  The event itself was hilarious.  The first few matchups were ehh but they got better as the event went on.  They even brought out some midgets at one point.  Afterwards went home and crashed.

  
Day 2:

Went back to Almanegra for coffee and then bused to down to the Coyoacan neighborhood.  I heard this area was very nice, if even a bit uppity.  I can now say the area was great.  It was definitely great.  There was an open square area with lots of bars and restaurants, a big food/vendor hall (tourist trap), and since I was there on a saturday there was an art event so I bought some street art.  I also noticed that there were more tourists here than in Roma Norte, purely based on how many people I walked by that spoke English.  Definitely came across more Americans, also seemed to come across more people in their 30s.  Honestly if/when I return to CDMX I might even stay in this neighborhood.  

Ending up getting a coffee at another great spot called [Avellaneda](https://www.instagram.com/avellanedakf/?hl=en), and then walked north.  I walked past the Frida Kahlo museum tried to get a ticket, but it was sold out for like the next ten days or something, so that if that's something you want to hit then definitely buy tickets ahead of time.  I did go to the Leon Trotsky museum though, which was very good especially for the price, and spent about one hour or so there before headed back.  Ended up getting some great middle eastern food near my room at a place called [Fuego](https://fuegooriental.com.mx/).

  
Day 3:

Decided to go back to the area where the museums are, but mainly just to explore park and get my nature fix.  Hit up a Japanese-themed cafe called [Cucurucho](https://cucuruchocafe.com/) on the way (also great, also bought some beans).  The park itself was so nice, many people running/bikes and even doing martial arts classes.  Afterwards I decided to go over the Historic Centro District.  Again I could've used the public transit, but I decided to walk/bike a bit since it was nice and there was so much to see.  The Centro area was wild.  First, I did not know CDMX had a Chinatown so that was interesting.  Also, it was by far the most crowded/hectic of all the places that I've been.  The area directly around the National Palace and Cathedral was filled with tents and homeless encampments.  I never felt unsafe or anything, but it was mind boggling how many tents there were.  I took some photos and then took the train back.  First time on the train and it quick and easy (crowded though).  Got off near my place, got a coffee at [Yola Cafe](https://www.instagram.com/yolacafealiado/?hl=en) (cool spot with lots of Star Wars decor).

That night, I said yolo again and decided to buy a ticket to the Club America vs. Cruz Azul footy match.  I'm a huge soccer fan, and even though I know Mexicans take footy seriously I decided to go.  Now where I went wrong was buying a cheap Cruz Azul jersey on my way to the game which was at the Club America stadium.  I collect jerseys, and I walked by a place selling some, and the Cruz Azul jersey looked sick so I bought it lol.  Luckily the stadium was nearby so I just had to bus, and upon pulling up it was pretty next level.  Thousands of fans, hundreds of police, but I never really felt unsafe.  Definitely different than all the games I've been to the states though, but honestly it was cool.  I just felt kinda silly wearing the Cruz Azul jersey.  And the stadium/game itself was awesome!  They had the smoke going beforehand, there was so much energy from the very beginning.  I was at the top and luckily sat next to some cool Club America fans who spoke decent English, and I just explained that I love football (soccer lol) and wanted to see a game, which they understood.  Ended up making small talk with them and had a great time.  Now Cruz Azul scored first but Club America came back to win, which I'm kinda glad given that my dumbass was wearing a Cruz Azul jersey.  Not to suggest that something bad might've happened, but still, didn't really wanna risk it.  Getting home from the stadium sucked though, I ran to the bus and the station was a mad house.  So much pushing and shoving.  Probably the shittiest bus ride ever.  But worth it.



Day 4:

A few days prior to this I booked a Teotihuacan Balloon Ride and Pyramid Tour on the GetYourGuide app for about $230USD, and today was the day for that.  My booking included: transportation to and from, a balloon tour, breakfast, a pyramid tour, and a tour at the Guadaloupe Basilica.  It started at 4:30AM at a monument in Roma Norte, basically met up with a group, got on a bus and rolled out.  Took about an hour to get to the balloon ride place.  The balloon ride was honestly sick, got some amazing views/pictures of the pyramids.  The balloons themselves were also fascinating to see operate.  Only negative thing worth mentioning is they are kind of crowded and you can't really move around the ""basket"" once you're up there.  After we landed we then went to some fancy restaurant with a breakfast buffet which was great.  After we ate there was also mini tequila/mezcal tasting and then we got to check out some azteca gift shop.  Then we went to the pyramids, where the guide briefly explained the history/significance of each and then we were free to roam for about an hour.  Luckily, the moon pyramid was open for the first time in several years so we were able to walk up.  It was such a magnificent thing to see in person.  The sun pyramid (the larger one) was closed but you could still walk up to the base of it.  I will say it was hot af mid day at those pyramids and even though I had long sleeves and a baseball cap I found feel the sun zapping me.  It was also crowded which was expected, but not as crowded as it would have been on the weekend though (I went on a Monday).  After leaving, we bused back towards the city.  We stopped at the Guadaloupe Basilica/Shrine, which wasn't really my thing but I still got out and took a look.

After getting back, I took a nap and then went out for dinner.  Ended up going back to the Lebanese place cause the kebabs were so good.  Then passed out.

  
Day 5:

Decided not to train to the airport and instead pre-ordered an uber to pick up.  Getting through the MEX airport was easy.  I had one snafu cause I had some 35mm film that I wanted hand checked, which took a bit to sort out.  But aside from it was easy.

  
Overall, I had a blast in CDMX and I totally plan to go back.  It felt almost like NYC or Paris in terms of sheer amount of things to see and do and a week really only scratched the service. If you love food/coffee/museums than it's a must visit place.  I was also impressed by their public transit system, only bummer was that there's no app and you had to get a physical card and reload it with pesos.

"Does anyone else keep returning to the same places because nothing else compares? I‚Äôm a 26F solo traveler, and I know solo travel is often about exploring new places‚Äîbut I keep thinking about the ones I‚Äôve already been to and *loved*. The trips that felt magical, meaningful, and unforgettable. The idea of going back excites me more than trying somewhere new.

I could venture out‚Ä¶ but what if I don‚Äôt love the new place as much? I‚Äôd probably wish I had just gone back to Italy. But then again, what if going back *isn‚Äôt* as good the second time? It‚Äôs like chasing the same magic, with no guarantee I‚Äôll find it again.

For context: I‚Äôm a law student in the U.S. with only a few weeks off twice a year, so I try to make the most of every trip. I look forward to them for months and try to fit in as much as I can.

Last summer, I flew into London for a couple days (my usual starting point from LA‚Äîdirect flights, favorite spots, and friends), then spent four nights in Ibiza, and *then* went to Italy. Ibiza in 2023 with my best friend was one of the best trips of my life, but in 2024 it wasn‚Äôt the same. She was constantly on FaceTime with her boyfriend and said she felt sick, so I went to a few shows alone. Some moments were fun, but overall I felt disconnected and low. On the last night, I was packing and crying on the phone with another friend while she was outside talking to her boyfriend.

But I still love Ibiza. I love dancing and electronic music, and even though that trip was hard, it‚Äôs one of the few places that truly aligns with the things I love. That said, I‚Äôm not sure I‚Äôd go back completely solo. Getting ready with someone, dancing with a friend, having someone to go to shows with ‚Äî it makes a difference there. I could make it work on my own (I actually met a couple of nice solo girls in the crowd one night), but it would definitely be harder.

By the time I got to Italy, I was carrying more than I expected‚Äîmentally and emotionally. Being alone in such beautiful places, especially the Dolomites and Lake Garda, felt almost spiritual. Even though the trip was short, it gave me space to breathe. It was exactly what I needed.

I had a similar experience with Iceland. I went for NYE 2023 on my first real international solo trip, and it was magical‚ÄîNorthern Lights, fireworks, that cozy, otherworldly feeling. I was nervous about going back the next year, but it totally lived up. I stayed in different hostels (though I preferred the first one), tried new restaurants‚Äîincluding one I absolutely loved‚Äîand explored a new region (Sn√¶fellsnes Peninsula). I saw the Northern Lights again, twice, and much more vividly‚Äîonce from a hot tub in the middle of nowhere. It felt different, but still really special. I‚Äôd go back again in a heartbeat.

Now I‚Äôm planning my summer trip‚Ä¶ and I‚Äôm torn between trying somewhere new or returning to the places that made me feel happy and alive. I‚Äôd love more time in the Dolomites. A slower visit to Lake Garda. Another walk to Portofino. More beach time in Cinque Terre. I‚Äôm open to exploring new places *within* Italy, but those northern regions keep pulling me back. And maybe I‚Äôll start the trip with a few solo nights in Ibiza again.

I‚Äôve seen a good amount of Europe and don‚Äôt feel a strong urge to go beyond it right now. Italy, Iceland, Ibiza, London‚Ä¶ those are the places I keep returning to. Even Copenhagen, which I visited for the first time this January, is already on my list to revisit‚Äîit was freezing and a lot was closed, but I loved the vibe and want to see it in warmer weather. Even newer places sometimes feel unfinished in a way that makes me want to return, not move on.

**TL;DR:** I know solo travel is often about discovering new places, but I keep wanting to return to the ones I already know I love and experienced magic in‚ÄîItaly, Iceland, Ibiza, and London‚Äîbecause of how good they made me feel. I‚Äôm a law student with limited time off, so every trip needs to count.

"5 Week Trip To Peru and Bolivia, Itinerary Route I am solo traveling South America ( Peru and Bolivia ) , and was wondering if there any must sees that i am missing out of my 37 day trip? Are there certain things that I am not accounting for in my Itinerary?

Salkantay Pass & Machu Picchu: If I have a two-day buffer in Cusco, is that enough time to organize the Salkantay trek and secure a Machu Picchu ticket?

Lima as at the End: I‚Äôve left a few unplanned days in Lima at the end of the itinerary. It felt a bit jam-packed, so I figured I could either use those days to rest or swap/add activities as needed.

Routing Challenges: I typically prefer a flexible itinerary, but it's been hard to route efficiently since I keep looping back to Lima. I'm trying to strike the right balance between having enough to do without overloading the schedule.

Amazon Jungle: I'm undecided on whether to visit the Amazon from Peru or Bolivia. It seems more common from Peru, but I‚Äôm open to either.

Must-Do Activities: I definitely want to do the Salkantay hike, sandboarding/buggies, and Bolivia‚Äôs Death Road.

Flights vs Buses: I included a lot of flights because I‚Äôve heard negative reviews about long bus rides and also want to manage altitude sickness better.

"I can't speak for Bolivia but your Peru timeline seems fine. The 8-10 hour busses were fine for me (Cruz del sur) but I chose to fly to avoid the longer ones. Domestic flights are affordable (especially if you don't have to check).

Careful booking the Salkantay last minute, they do start to fill up and the most sought after permits go first. It is worth reaching out to a couple companies beforehand. I'm not suggesting booking months in advance but I also don't think putting it off as long as some do is wise. 

Make sure to grab the multi site tourist pass for Moray, Pisac, and other stops in Cusco/Sacred Valley. 

If you end up with free time in Lima, I enjoyed the Larco Museum a ton.

I plan to start in Peru and travel from Lima up north by Bus and plan to end in Guayaquil, Ecuador (because of a booked to flight to Galapagos from there). I've heard some safety-concerns about traveling by bus in ecuador and crossing the border by land. Especially i've heard, that most buses are crossing the border by night (Bus from Mancora to Cuenca or directly to Guayaquil).

"6 month eurotrip **Hi everyone, hope you're doing well!**

This December, I‚Äôll be finishing my college degree in Argentina, and I‚Äôm planning to travel to Europe in 2026. The idea is to spend around six months there, from March to August. Spanish is my native language, I'm fluent in English, and I plan to learn some basic Italian before the trip. It‚Äôll be my first time both traveling solo and visiting Europe. I have Spanish passport.

My plan is to visit major cities and stay in hostels for about 7 to 14 days in each place. I‚Äôll be continuing my remote part-time job, working from 2 PM to 7 PM (European time). That way, I can explore the city in the mornings, head back to the hostel or a caf√© to work in the afternoon, and then go out in the evenings‚Äîeither to grab something to eat or spend time with fellow travelers. On weekends, I‚Äôd like to take day trips to nearby towns, or even hop on a train somewhere before work.

I'm thinking of starting the trip in Madrid‚Äîsince I speak the language and I‚Äôve heard the people are super friendly. Here's a rough itinerary I have in mind:

* Madrid
* Lisbon
* Rome and the rest of Italy (I might stay in Rome for more than two weeks, given its cultural weight)
* The Balkans and Budapest
* Vienna, Prague
* Berlin (I have family there), Amsterdam, Paris, and London

That‚Äôs the general plan, but of course I‚Äôll stay flexible along the way. I expect to spend more time in Italy, especially Rome, and I‚Äôm still unsure how long to stay in the Balkans(I don‚Äôt know much about the region or the languages). I also want to avoid spending like 14 days in the most expensive cities. Part of the trip I‚Äôll be doing with friends who also work remotely.

I estimate a budget of about ‚Ç¨2,000 per month‚Äîdoes that sound reasonable?

A couple of questions I have:

* Would it be better to spend July and August in cooler cities, or head to coastal areas like beaches in Spain, Italy, or the Balkans?
* I‚Äôll have 2‚Äì3 weeks of vacation (not necessarily taken all at once). At which point in the trip would you recommend using them?

Would really appreciate your thoughts and suggestions!",post,r/solotravel,Comedy,3.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1krygfl/6_month_eurotrip/
"Sounds like a very solid plan. Staying everywhere a little longer doesn't make it feel rushed which is nice. In 6 months you could cover a lot of ground if you want too. 

Maybe have a look at EURail or Interrail for the more expensive countries. This way you can travel around freely by 99% of the trains. It might be worth to have a look into this.

Since you're travelling a long period I would start in the south. Madrid in March is very chill, same for Lisbon. In summer it can get really hot in these cities which is terrible if you're there for travelling. Same counts for most of the Balkan and Italy. I think the move is to go to London, Paris, Prague, Amsterdam, Berlin etc. In July/August. The weather will be better in these places in that period too. 

When you should take your vacation is completely up to you. You can do it at a place you're expecting to really like, do it at a place where you know some people, take the days when you just got to Europe or the last days to wander around freely.",comment_1,r/solotravel,Comedy,,https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1krygfl/6_month_eurotrip/

"Sounds cool make sure to check out The man in seat 61 (seat61.com) there is a lot of useful information regarding eurail on there. The system of eurail is quite complicated but works well when you understand it. 

I'm not a beach person so it's hard to give a good answer to that question. But keep in mind July and August are the hottest months in Europe. If being on the beach with 35¬∞C is your thing yeah it's a good idea. For me personally I would do my beach stops at the end of May or June and go to northern Europe in July/August. These places do not have good weather all year so visiting these places with nice weather nice. The time frame on cities like Lisbon or Valencia is way bigger since the weather is nice most of the year.

"Party hostels as a solo introvert? I‚Äôm a year or two out of college. I want to take a trip to Europe. I studied abroad in college and loved it, primarily the drinking and clubbing in new cities.

I am a weird case where I‚Äôm an introvert but I love to party. I love clubbing. I drink too much. But I always do this with friends and am introverted / borderline antisocial unless I am drunk (drunk me is very social and loved by all) or have a friend there to help me break the ice with the stranger.

I sort of just want that feeling again of being in college again and partying with people in a foreign city with no attachments. But just because of the timeline involved with my job, I can‚Äôt go with any of my friends. So I‚Äôm curious, will party hostels do a good job of letting me meet other people, or would they not work for me as I‚Äôm introverted.

"Unrelated to your question but using alcohol as the gateway to being extroverted is extremely unhealthy and will definitely catch up to you. 

Maybe use this chance solo traveling at social/party hostels to not have to need alcohol to talk to strangers being able to strike up conversation without feeling anxious or nervous. It really is a good life skill and will only become a hinderance if you never develop the skill. 

I am also a natural introvert, not to extent that you describe but I have done two solo travel trips to Europe, each a month long, staying at party hostels. In my experience it forces me in to uncomfortable situations where I can grow and meet people I would have never met if I went with friends.

"I went to all of the places on your Itenerary last June/July. (Though Zabljak got cut a bit short) All three of your options are good. Personally I would extend in Theth and Mostar. In Mostar I would want two full days, 1 for a Herzegovina tour and one day for the city. In Theth I spent 2 nights and wish I had more time. It was just so peaceful and had such great hikes. I also agree to taking a day off Kotor is the way to go if you want to steal a day from somewhere.

Between Berat and Gjirokaster, I like Gjirokaster so much more and actually spent like 3-4 nights (but you really only need 2). To me Berat was just okay, good for a stop over and beautiful but the city didn‚Äôt have too much to do and to me the canyoning wasn‚Äôt adventurous enough. If these options just didn‚Äôt take so long to get to from Tirana, I would recommend this route but I think you would feel rushed and bus times can be uncertain or awkward in Albania. I know when I went from Gjirokaster to Berat, there was one bus a day that left at like 6am. 

Ulcinj was cute and definitely would be a good addition if you choose to add a relaxing spot. It‚Äôs a super close drive from Shkoder. I went on a boat tour and it was great! It also wasn‚Äôt super touristy which was nice and I know there is a good amount to do in the surrounding area.

"I stayed in Edinburgh on my own for about three days last week - it was the last leg of my solo trip to Scotland. Admittedly, I wish I had spent way more time there as I'm certain I only experienced a small percentage of what they city has to offer (and not much outside of touristy attractions like the castle and the typical pub experience on the Royal Mile).

  
If you're looking for a unique live music experience, though, I do have at least one recommendation. There are two pubs, both close to the Mile, that have live music (I believe every night). Only it's not necessarily just a band playing a scheduled gig. It's more like locals who come in and play together. People jump in and join here and there. It's more of an open setting that allows people to grab an instrument and play together, and it makes for a pretty unique pub scene - and just feels authentically Scottish.

"Cambodia, Laos, and (briefly) Thailand - whirlwind version I just got back from a week in Cambodia and Laos (with a day and a half in bangkok) and took my travel journal notes and refined it into something readable.  Love to hear comments or questions. I've never written anything like this before:

I‚Äôve always had a thing for off-the-beaten-path travel‚Äînot in the Instagram-influencer sense, but in the real, footsore, soul-thirsty kind of way. The kind where you sweat through your clothes by noon, get lost in markets that smell like lemongrass and diesel, and come home with stories that don‚Äôt require filters. Cambodia and Laos had been tugging at my sleeve for nearly two decades. I‚Äôd been to Vietnam a few years back, and loved it‚Äîbut this time, I was after something different. Something older, deeper. More tangled in jungle vines and centuries of spiritual memory. So I carved out one precious week‚Äîan ambitious itinerary stitched together with tuk-tuks, temple tours, and tiny planes‚Äîand set off. It took nearly 24 hours of travel to get from Dulles to Siem Reap. There were layovers in Abu Dhabi and Bangkok, a fast-track concierge with the energy of a hummingbird on Red Bull, and an airport shuffle that felt like an international obstacle course. By the time I stepped out into the Cambodian heat, it hit me like a wall‚Äîand a whisper. I was here. Finally here.

My tuk-tuk from the airport never showed. Apparently, it broke down en route. A car was sent in its place, and honestly, after the flights, I didn‚Äôt care if a donkey showed up as long as it had a seat and got me to a shower. I checked into Sakaban Suite on Sok San around 4:30 p.m., peeled off my travel shell, and took what I‚Äôm pretty sure was the best shower of my life.(Though in fairness, better ones would follow.) That first night was low-key. I wandered the neighborhood a little, wide-eyed and jetlagged, then circled back for some lok lak at the hotel restaurant‚Äî tender beef, a fried egg, and a punchy pepper and lime dipping sauce, and the perfect gateway drug into Cambodian cuisine.

The next morning began at 3:45 a.m.‚Äîbecause when you're in Siem Reap, you rise with the sun to greet the temples. I met up with my tour group, a patchwork of travelers from Norway, Dubai, India, Ireland, Japan. We were all half-asleep and quietly reverent as we waited by the reflecting pool. The sun didn't give us drama ‚Äî no epic silhouette shot ‚Äî but instead offered a soft, almost sacred light. A slow reveal.Walking the Angkor complex was like paging through a forgotten chapter of humanity. Built in the early 12th century during the reign of King Suryavarman II, Angkor Wat is the largest religious monument in the world‚Äîand it feels like it. But it‚Äôs not just the scale that moves you. It‚Äôs the stories told in stone. The intricate bas-reliefs along the inner galleries are vast, narrative tapestries of Hindu epics‚Äîthe Churning of the Ocean of Milk, the Battle of Kurukshetra‚Äîeach carved with painstaking devotion. These were more than decoration; they were scripture in sandstone. As we moved through the complex, the line between spiritual past and present blurred. Steep staircases led us to active shrines, where incense curled around worn stone. The architecture told stories of shifting faiths‚Äî Hindu motifs interlaced with Buddhist serenity‚Äîetched into sandstone by hands long gone.

Ta Prohm, the so-called ""Tomb Raider Temple,"" was like Angkor‚Äôs wild, overgrown sibling. Tree roots poured over towers as if the earth itself had decided to pull the temple back underground . There was even an echo chamber that responded only to the sound of a chest-thump‚Äîanything else was swallowed in silence. It felt‚Ä¶ ancient, yes, but weirdly alive. By the time we hit Bayon, the heat had ramped up to ‚Äúgrill-your-soul‚Äù levels, but I still remember the strange calm of those stone-carved faces. Dozens of them, serene and enigmatic, staring down from the towers like celestial sentinels. They‚Äôve watched empires rise and fall, and still they smile.

Day three took me farther afield: to Beng Melea and Koh Ker. Our group was small. Conversation was sparse. But in the hush, the jungle spoke. Beng Melea felt like myth made real. Beng Melea was like Ta Prohm turned up to eleven ‚Äî raw, crumbling, haunting, gorgeous. Nature was winning here. At Prasat Pram, two of the towers were so entangled in roots they could‚Äôve been a set from a Guillermo del Toro movie. It was haunting and beautiful and absolutely surreal. Lunch was bitter melon and egg, which my mouth liked more than my stomach. That became evident as I climbed the steep staircase of Koh Ker, a 36-meter pyramid built by King Jayavarman IV in the 10th century. My lungs filed a formal complaint. But the view from the top? Jungle stretching into forever. No crowds. No hum of modernity. An ocean of green, trapped in time. That night, a smoothie. Another lok lak. A sleep like stone.

The next morning brought a quieter, more personal excursion‚Äîa solo tuk-tuk tour to three Buddhist temples around Siem Reap. The ride itself felt like a gift; for the first time on this trip, I wasn't sharing space with strangers or racing a schedule. Just me, the city streets, and the steady hum of the motor. The temples were tranquil, removed from the buzz of the more famous sites. Monks moved slowly through courtyards, saffron robes catching the light. My guide was patient, insightful, and let the spaces speak for themselves. After the second temple, we took a detour through a local market‚Äînot one of the polished, tourist-facing ones, but a real, fragrant, chaotic sprawl of fish, fruit, textiles, incense, and motor oil. It was vibrant, pungent, and unforgettable. At the third temple, I received a traditional Cambodian water blessing. I sat beside my guide as the monk tied a saffron string around my wrist, murmuring prayers. Then, with a rhythm both soothing and ceremonial, he poured ladles of water over my head, continuing to chant. I‚Äôm not Buddhist, but in that moment, beneath the ancient roof of a temple tucked into the edges of town, I felt still. Grateful. Reverent. A change of clothes, a moment of reflection‚Äîand I was back on the road, headed north.

Leaving Cambodia felt like walking out of a dream I wasn‚Äôt finished having. But Laos waited, and my flight north to Luang Prabang turned out to be one of the most beautiful landings I‚Äôve ever experienced. As the plane dipped toward the tarmac, mist curled over emerald mountains and the Nam Khan River wound through the hills like a silk ribbon tossed by a careless god. Like drifting into Shangri-La The airport was refreshingly tiny‚Äîlike, ‚Äúdid I time travel to 1987?‚Äù tiny. Almost everything was closed, save for a few currency exchange booths that felt like lemonade stands. I changed my cash, found the taxi queue, and soon enough was in a shared van with a few strangers, rumbling down quiet roads as twilight settled over the city. And then, in classic Southeast Asia fashion, my hotel appeared to be located... in the middle of a night market.

The driver pulled over, looked at me, and asked if I had Google Maps. I looked down at my suitcase, looked up at the sea of stalls, lanterns, and bodies, and laughed. Of course. So I forged ahead on foot, dragging my suitcase through the crowd like a lost extra from The Amazing Race. And somewhere between the silk scarves and sizzling skewers, I ran into two familiar faces‚Äîthe sisters from Dubai, from my Angkor Wat tour. A brief reunion, just long enough to smile and say how crazy it was to see each other again. Then, on I went, eventually finding my lodging: Queen‚Äôs House. Soft bed, cold shower, and a room full of charm‚Äîand mosquitoes. But honestly? Beautiful. I passed out.

My original plan was to take a riverboat down to Kuang Si Falls that morning. But the organizer evaporated, so I rerouted. I strolled through the morning market‚Äîwatching locals haggle over fruit, spices, and what I think might have been buffalo snouts‚Äîthen swung by Saffron Caf√© for some much-needed coffee. Eventually, I arranged a trip to the falls with a tuktuk driver. But‚Äîcurse or blessing‚ÄîI have some kind of tuk-tuk hex. My solo ride turned into a 15-passenger van. And that 15- passenger van somehow acquired 17 passengers. But what a drive. Rolling hills, roadside villages, stilt houses with tin roofs. There‚Äôs a rawness to the Laotian countryside‚Äîpoverty that‚Äôs visible, yes, but met with smiles and warmth and a sense of pride that no economic metric can measure. When we arrived, we were told we had two and a half hours to explore. My heart sank. I had come to zipline over those falls, and I wasn‚Äôt about to miss it. So I bolted down the walking trails, past the bear sanctuary (yep‚Äîsun bears, adorable and sleepy), and met my arch nemesis: a 542-step staircase going all the way to the top. In 98¬∞ heat with 70% humidity and a backpack. Grueling. But I made it. The view was glorious. And the zipline? Worth every lactic acid-soaked step. Zipping over those turquoise pools, high above limestone terraces and through the jungle canopy‚Äîit wasn‚Äôt just exhilarating. It was cinematic. A heart-in-your-throat, air-on-yourskin kind of thrill that feels like you‚Äôre rewriting gravity, if only for a second. Each station offered a fresh gasp, a new angle on paradise. It was five scenes of euphoria, strung together by cable and courage. But then‚Ä¶ reality. I got back 30 minutes late. My ride? Gone. My wallet? Still in my hotel. My cash? Nearly gone. Cue Google Translate, downloaded Lao dictionary, and a small miracle named compassionate staff member. She helped me find a tuk-tuk driver willing to take me back to town on the promise that I wouldn‚Äôt vanish when it was time to pay. (He believed me. I don‚Äôt know if I would‚Äôve.) Back at the hotel, cash delivered, soul intact. That night I treated myself to dinner at Tamarind‚Äîa restaurant that elevates Laotian cuisine to art. I ordered the stuffed lemongrass, and I‚Äôm not exaggerating when I say it was one of the most beautiful dishes I‚Äôve ever eaten. Crisp, fragrant, layered in flavor and color. If Southeast Asia had a culinary cathedral, that lemongrass dish was one of its stained glass windows.

In my infinite wisdom, I had also ordered a smoothie at Tamarind. My stomach, still recovering from its last fruity betrayal, objected. Loudly. So I took it easy the next morning. A slow stroll through the streets, some final souvenirs, and then it was time to pack for Bangkok. This time, my hotel actually did send a tuk-tuk. I know, shocking. Except‚Äîit was actually a very nice car. At this point I stopped asking questions and just enjoyed the ride. Luang Prabang‚Äôs airport, felt like a relic from another era. No bustle. No chaos. Just the slow shuffle of time. My flight back to Bangkok was short, scenic, and bittersweet.

By the time I reached my hotel in Bangkok‚Äî Two Three a Homely Hotel, a small and quiet spot tucked in the labyrinthine streets of Sukhumvit‚ÄîI was feeling‚Ä¶ off. My plans to explore the chaos and nightlife of Bangkok evaporated in favor of hot soup and air conditioning. I ordered Tom Kha Kai via Grab. It arrived warm, fragrant, and perfectly soothing. The next morning, I felt human again. With my last full day in Asia, I navigated the metro and made my way to the old city. I wandered the temple complex, shooting photographs of Wat Arun‚Äôs delicate porcelain surfaces and Wat Pho‚Äôs golden reclining Buddha. The heat was oppressive, the sky washed in white light, but I was back in wonder mode again. That afternoon I cooled off in the hotel pool, repacked my gear, and caught a few hours of sleep before my 3:00 a.m. flight out. By 11:00 p.m., I was in a taxi to the airport‚Äîone last ride through Bangkok‚Äôs neon streets.

And here I sit, an hour from boarding, body aching in the best kind of way. I‚Äôm not sure if I ever fully stopped moving. There was more I wanted to see‚Äîmore waterfalls, more temples, more time to sit still and let it all soak in. But that's how you know a trip was good, right? You leave full‚Äîbut never finished.",post,r/solotravel,Comedy,8.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1krkazx/cambodia_laos_and_briefly_thailand_whirlwind/
"Sofia and Skopje Solo Trip Report Sofia and Skopje trip report

Recently returned from a trip to Bulgaria and North Macedonia and figured I‚Äôd share the experience. 

Arrival day: I connected thru Istanbul where I had a 5 hr layover, second flight got delayed so I didn‚Äôt arrive to Sofia until about 9:30. I grabbed some cash from an ATM (thank god), and had already downloaded the yellow app to use taxis while in Bulgaria. I 90% of the time take the metro from airport into the city but the route to Hostel Mostel, where I stayed, was not very direct and estimated 35 ish minutes, and after a whole day+ of traveling I didn‚Äôt want to deal with it. I forgot to load my card into the app first, which is one reason I said thank god I decided to get cash right away, and took about a 15 minute cab ride to the hostel. I used the drive to activate my eSIM. As I‚Äôm arriving to the hostel, I get a text from the front desk. I booked a private room night 1, and then was going to switch to the regular dorm after. 

They inform me the front desk is closed and send me instructions to get into the private room, which is several blocks away. Good thing I had an eSIM and even could receive this text, as I don‚Äôt know how I ever would‚Äôve known it was in a different building had I not. I eventually reach the apartment, get in and dump my stuff and realize I‚Äôm starving and need to eat. Nothing was open at all, I found one pub and the kitchen was closed for the night, ended up just going back and eating the rest of the chips I had bought in the airport. Tried to take a shower and the only water temperature was scalding hot. Eventually just gave myself a pits and junk shower from the sink and crashed. 


Day 1: 

I woke up and left the apartment at 8 to head toward the hostel and check in. Here, they told me they only accept cash, another lucky stroke I hit the ATM upon arrival. I paid and stored my luggage and set off. 

I was walking toward the train station and found a lovely cafe where I had a small sandwich with fresh veggies and ham and cream cheese and a coffee. Set off for the station again and reached it after walking through what I can imagine now is closer to the average of a Sofia neighborhood than the much nicer parts. The train station kiosk was remarkably easy to use when choosing English as the language and I grabbed my train tickets for a few days out for my trip planned to Plovdiv. 

Next I walked back towards town and passed the city mosque, which was unique, the regional history museum which was super cool, and went in to check out the Serdika Roman ruins complex, a development they discovered about 15 years ago when digging a new metro tunnel. It was all great stuff from the Roman Empire, a whole street with some well preserved architecture and the context they could glean from the ruins was quite thorough. 

I pushed on to Alexander Nevsky cathedral, which was super awesome. It was as ornate on the outside as almost any cathedral I‚Äôve seen, and the inside was stunning too. I then headed back toward the main strip, Vitosha Boulevard, and got a traditional lunch of patatnik, a sort of potato pastry, and rabbit stew. By now my bed was ready so I headed back to the hostel. 

I was shown to the dorm, and it was unlike any of the other 3 dozen hostels I‚Äôve stayed in. The 20+ beds were all just out in the open in one giant room, maybe 2 feet apart from one another. I imagine it closer to an albergue along the Camino route than your traditional hostel. The hostel did have traditional rooms, but they were all booked up when I booked so I had to choose the giant dorm. No biggie tho, I dumped my stuff and set back off for the communist walking tour I had booked. 

This was super interesting, as eastern history interests me a lot and i had done a communist walking tour in Bucharest before, as well as a lot of reading about the eastern bloc in general. Bulgaria did not have quite the same experience as many other eastern bloc countries. There was no bloody revolution, people wanted for food and hyperinflation occurred, but not to the extent of Romania starving while Ceausescu built the palace, or any of Stalin‚Äôs famines. Their overthrow was the day after the Berlin Wall fell, when the second in command stood up during a parliament meeting and informed everyone Todor Zhivkov, the longest reigning communist leader, would be stepping down and there would be a democratic election to be held. We ended this tour at the palace of culture, which was nicely settled in a park with a large fountain, where a spring festival was taking place and i had a beer and relaxed. 

I meandered back to the hostel and grabbed some pizza on the way, got back, showered, and waited for a football match i wanted to watch would kick off. The hostel front desk told me of an Irish pub that would have it and I enjoyed a nearly incomprehensible conversation with a Glaswegian stag do as I watched the match, and got back to the hostel at about 1 and crashed. This night i slept fine as mostly everyone was asleep already when i returned and i was dog tired.


Day 2: 

I woke up and headed to a cafe on Vitosha Boulevard again for breakfast. I killed some time here reading before my appointment at the Red Flat, which was a well-preserved apartment from the 80s filled with all the appliances and everything a stereotypical family would‚Äôve had under the last years of communism in Bulgaria. The experience encourages you to touch things and play with toys and appliances and gadgets, and there‚Äôs an audio guide that‚Äôs about an hour long that talks you through everything their life would have included. I highly recommend this. 

After that i got another coffee and read for a few hours as i was super tired, and got dinner at another  place on Vitosha Boulevard. I walked back to the hostel, showered, and got in bed hoping to go to sleep early as my train left the station at 8:20 ish the next morning. Here was when the hostel experience soured heavily. These 2 guys were FaceTiming someone on full volume, both talking animatedly and the phone loud too, until about 21:00. Finally someone got up and turned the light off, where their shenigans kept on going, with them tickling each other and giggling and shoving each other off their beds for about another hour. I asked them to please be quiet and they apologized and were quiet for 10 minutes before resuming. Here i donned earplugs and my sleep mask but the combination of the bed being wildly uncomfortable, 0 privacy which made me feel a bit weird having 2 of my senses completely annulled, and knowing i needed to be up early meant i got about 0 sleep this whole night. Eventually woke up to my alarm, quietly slunk out and grabbed a taxi for the train station.


Day 3: 

The train left on time and was on schedule all the way to my arrival in Plovdiv. Here I left the train station and walked toward the Roman forum. I walked through a lovely park that was filled with people walking and sitting around. The forum was amazing. It‚Äôs situated right on a pedestrian street i walked up, and on the other end is the Roman stadium. These structures are built into the modern street, with glass railings to view, it‚Äôs really quite cool. I kept going and eventually got some lunch. I headed toward the amphitheater which was the highlight of the ruins. It‚Äôs up on a hill and you can see the mountains in the back, and you can walk all around and in the theater. 

After this I meandered old town and got some Mavrud wine, a local product. I went to Nebet Tepe, which is an ancient fortress that had evidence of being built in the 5th century BC in some parts. It was fixed and destroyed some more throughout history but was remarkably cool. I headed back down the hill and walked over to a park with a monument to Vasil Levsky. In this same park there is an enormously tall statue dedicated to the Soviet soldier up on the hill. I didn‚Äôt ever find out the sentiment regarding this statue, but the ones in Sofia are either vandalized, have already been removed, or are planning to be removed when it involves a Soviet built monument thanking the soviets for anything. 

At this point I felt like I had seen Plovdiv enough and wanted to go back to Sofia, but 2 things were in my mind. I needed an earlier train back, as my initial purchase was the last train back. And 2, i could not do another night in the hostel. I was exhausted physically and mentally. So i found a mall to sit in and have dinner, got a hotel room for the night, and headed back to the station to get a seat on the next train back. I returned to the hostel, grabbed my stuff, and headed to the hotel, which was probably the absolutely nicest thing I could have ever needed in that moment. A clean, modern bathroom and shower, and a dark, silent room with a king bed and fresh sheets. I passed out almost immediately. 


Day 4: 

I woke up, had hotel breakfast, and went right to the airport to grab my rental car. Within 20 minutes i was driving to Skopje. The drive was mostly uneventful, the border crossing was a neat experience as I‚Äôve only ever done Schengen land border crossing (aka just keep on driving), and was on the outskirts of Skopje before i knew it. The landscape on this drive was pretty spectacular too, i felt like I was in a top gear special almost, whipping my little Renault through mountainous Macedonia. 

Getting through the actual city was a nightmare, though, as the traffic was insane and there was so much more foot traffic all around me i was a bit overwhelmed. At one point the guys at a stoplight who wash your windshield and asked for money came up and I was yelling no and waving my hands but they did it anyway. The dude then was bashing in my window when I wouldn‚Äôt roll it down or acknowledge him until I had to practically scream for him to fuck off and that I didn‚Äôt have any cash (which was true, if he wanted MKD). I got to the hotel where parking was a total chaotic mess too and checked in and immediately laid down with my eyes closed for a solid 20 minutes trying to decompress. 

I packed my day bag and set out, walking up towards city park. I should mention my eSIM stopped working in NM, even though I specifically asked the orange employee if the orange Europe holiday eSIM worked in NM, and they confirmed yes (I have the email transcript to prove it, think I can get a refund??). So I was just wandering dark here. The park turned out to be lovely, I stopped by the national stadium and there turned out to be a tennis tournament going on that I watched a bit of. I read some more and headed towards a street that looked enticing. There were about a dozen restaurants on this street and I had a beer or three and some food, and had a little bar cat sit by me the whole time. I got gelato on my walk home and felt that inexplicable rush of joy when traveling like you just had an amazing time just choosing to be proactive and go out and enjoy life and see and do new things.


Day 5:

I woke up and headed right to the city center. I got breakfast and a coffee in Macedonia square under the shadow of an awesome monument to Alexander the Great. I checked out a nearby mall to see if I could find a jacket or shirt of one of the local football teams to no success, but found mother Theresa‚Äôs birth site, which was neat. I crossed the stone bridge to the old town and wandered around in the bazaar for a while, getting another coffee and an amazing pastry that was sort of like baklava, how it feels a little wet, but wasn‚Äôt flaky like baklava, and shaped in a circle. I forget the name but the guy said it was a traditional Macedonian pastry when I was looking in the glass. 

I headed up to the fortress which was very cool, though wildly unkempt and offered almost 0 context or info. I think the city should step in here to landscape it better, put up signs with info or maybe a little info center, and then you could easily charge a few euros for entry. When I walked down I stopped in the museum of Macedonian struggle for independence, which wasn‚Äôt the most amazing museum, but worth the entry fee of like 3 euros I something like that. 

I walked back down and got lunch before heading to the walking tour meeting spot. This tour unfortunately doubled back on nearly my identical route I just did, but the guide was born and raised in Skopje and very passionate about Macedonian history and culture, and pretty funny. This was about 3 hours and led us to dinner time, where myself and 3 German people on the tour went to a craft brewery in the old town the guide pointed it. The Pilsner at least was amazing, and the other guys seemed to enjoy whatever kind they got. 

I stopped at this brutalist post office on my walk back and really marveled at how unique of a building style it is. There are many pros to it in its utility and cost but it can be so ugly! This building at least had a bunch of quirks and seemingly some design thought though. I stopped for another beer on the way home when I saw some guys watching euroleague basketball and got home at about 10 and fell asleep right away.


Day 6:

I woke up, got breakfast at a cafe, and left. This was 1 May, so the streets were nearly empty today and I got out of the city in a breeze. This ride went fine again, and when I got through to Bulgaria again I headed toward Sofia slightly but turned south toward Rila, my destination being Rila Monastery. This is about 30km on a winding 1 lane road through the woods and mountains, and it was really cool at some points. I basically drove right through lunch, so at about 14:00 I stopped at a restaurant on this road about 6km from the monastery. I sat down and waited about 15 minutes without being served so I ducked inside and made myself known to the waitress, who just said sit anywhere and I returned back to my table. 10 more minutes went by and no service, so I just left. I headed about 2km down the road and stopped at the next one. I walked in, asked for a table for 1 and the waitress said the restaurant was full. I could see clearly an open table with 1 seat at it, but whatever, I left. I stopped at the next place and the dearest old woman came to serve me right away. I had shopska salad, tarator, and rila river trout here, it was absolutely amazing and I was ravenous too and ate every bite. 

I got to the monastery about 10 minutes later and had my mind blown again. It was one of the coolest places I can remember. 360¬∞ of mountains surrounding it, a crashing river right next to it, and the monastery and church itself were so cool. I sat down just looking around for probably an hour. 

I set off back toward Sofia again and realized the car was nearly out of gas. There were almost 0 gas stations on the highway itself that didn‚Äôt require getting off and doubling back. When I finally found one, the pumps had 0 labels that showed the petrol as benzene 95. I had to go in and ask and they were super rude unfortunately, but I filled up eventually and headed in to stop at The Mall in Sofia for dinner, walked a bit, and then drove my car back to the airport, dropped it off, and walked to my airport hotel which took way longer than maps said it would. 

Crashed, woke up, grabbed my flight and 24 hours later am back home. Both destinations were lovely. I have some regrets in not giving Macedonia its own vacation, as Matkq caves I was told are amazing, and lake ohrid deserved a visit as well. I want to return to Bulgaria as well to do the seven lakes hike and go to Burgas. All in all, a great experience in both Bulgaria and North Macedonia",post,r/solotravel,Comedy,35.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1kr7fqm/sofia_and_skopje_solo_trip_report/

"To Annecy, or not to Annecy? - 27 M, first time in France Hey all!

27 M from Canada. I have been saving up for a three week trip to France, and I plan to go just after Easter in 2026. This is my first time travelling overseas and first time travelling solo. I am a huge history buff, a fan of long walks (both around cities and nature hikes), a gourmand, and a professional wine connoisseur.

The first part of my itinerary is 3 days in Bordeaux, 3 days in the Loire, 3 days in Paris. I then plan is to spend 3 days in Alsace (specifically Colmar and environs), 2 days in Dijon (with a day trip to Beaune), then 5 days in Provence (3 nights in Avignon, 2 nights in Marseille, with day trips to Arles, Aix, and Cassis).

Problem is, I also really want to make it to Annecy and I am having trouble fitting it in to my itinerary, and I'm not sure if the extra travel is worth it.

I could stay two nights in Lyon and make Annecy a day trip; or I could travel from Dijon to Annecy, stay the night, then travel to Avignon the next day. I could cut a day off my Colmar time, or one of my days in Provence, or both. I could extend my trip by a day to fit everything in and lose a day of recuperation before returning to work, or I could cut one of these things out without adding Annecy just to give me some breathing room.

My question is to people who have visited these places: **What would you do if you were in my shoes and why?**

Other pertinent info: I do not drive, so will need to be able to walk or transit wherever I go. Also, I spoke French quite well a decade ago (B2 proficiency), but I haven't used it at all since then.",post,r/solotravel,Comedy,3.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1krlzkg/to_annecy_or_not_to_annecy_27_m_first_time_in/
"First of all, please tell us why you want to go to Annecy? What do you want to see/do there, that you think you won't be able to see/do in your other destinations?


Also how flexible is that three-week plan? Can you extend or no?

"Acatenango volcano, Guatemala, too hard? Im traveling to Guatemala solo, it is my first solo trip. I‚Äôm 22, slim but not really fit as I don‚Äôt do many sports. I did a couple of hikes in Chiang Mai Thailand and an overnight one but it wasn‚Äôt very steep, and it was for beginners, other than that I am not too experienced in hiking but have the necessary gear. 

Is it too hard for beginners? I really want to see the eruption and have the overnight experience but I‚Äôm afraid i would kinda be setting myself up for danger and to be miserable (specially because I‚Äôm solo after all) 

I did see that there were other options for volcanos that weren‚Äôt as demanding but none seemed to over overnight :/ 
I would also like to know if lake atlitan is worth it for someone looking to immerse in nature and for some quiet, and if it‚Äôs safe for female travelers (heart stories about murders there)",post,r/solotravel,Comedy,7.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1kr8nns/acatenango_volcano_guatemala_too_hard/
"Acantenago was the highlight of my trip. It's absolutely beautiful, but yes, it's difficult. You have plenty of time to climb up. Just take your time. The view is absolutely worth the effort. Fuego erupts every 10 minutes and it's stunning.",comment_1,r/solotravel,Comedy,,https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1kr8nns/acatenango_volcano_guatemala_too_hard/
"**Acatenango:**

Yes - it's objectively hard. It's a steep uphill and then back. See the trail overview here: [https://www.alltrails.com/trail/guatemala/chimaltenango/volcan-acatenango](https://www.alltrails.com/trail/guatemala/chimaltenango/volcan-acatenango)

A few other points:

\- most people do this hike with tours (100 to 140 USD) since they can provide porters and accommodation at the top. but you still have to get yourself up.

\- the peak is 4KM above the sea level. Many people get altitude sickness. you should allow time to climatize and/or take altitude pills just in case. 

\- jet lag, travel tiredness, not sleeping in your own bed will just make the hike harder.

\- the trail isn't maintained or engineered at all. Especially the first 1/3 is gravel and sandy. imo 60% of the trail wasn't actually enjoyable to hike. 

  
my 2 cents: I don't know your fitness level but if you don't hike a lot, I recommend you train for it for a few months. I saw SO many tourists who struggled and some even had to return because of anaphylactic shock or altitude sickness.

Just because it's a touristy hike and many others do it, it doesn't make it easy! don't trust social media, they rarely show the the reality of the hike.

  
\---  
**Other hikes:**

Look into Pacaya Volcano. Sure it's not overnight, but honestly that the Acatenango camping ground wasn't anything fancy. 

\---

**Lake atitlan:**

It's safe-ish. Safe for solo travelers since there's a TON of other travelers. Look into Free Cerveza hostel. As for the nature, it's quite stunning but jfyi that lake's water isn't the cleanest to swim in.",comment_2,r/solotravel,Comedy,,https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1kr8nns/acatenango_volcano_guatemala_too_hard/

"Planning Long-Term Slow Travel at 25 with ¬£10k Goal ‚Äì Living Light, Teaching Yoga, Shooting Photos. Is My Packing List Overkill? Some background: I‚Äôve been working for about a year - currently saving up to ¬£10,000 in savings and they 4-5k spare (which will take almost a year from now to get to) so I can travel long term. I‚Äôve lived out of a single small backpack before for 9 months - I wasn‚Äôt pacing myself, mostly because I was less mature and wanted to experience everything all at once.

I‚Äôll be 25 heading off again, since I started my last trip I‚Äôve done some part time yoga instruction after getting a teacher cert and I‚Äôve taken up photography and it‚Äôs growing to become a larger focus in my life at the moment. I‚Äôm a software engineer by trade but I‚Äôm not looking for that to follow me into a remote worker lifestyle.

I‚Äôm planning to travel slow - I guess it doesn‚Äôt matter where exactly but I will be pretty warm the majority of the time I should think. I‚Äôm going to use coachsurf, Worldpackers, wwwoof, and I heard before there‚Äôs something similar for yoga teachers possibly?

"Single Woman Luxury Retreat Hi! I am a young woman (22) looking for a retreat to spend a week doing some soul-searching and resetting. 

I need it to be a technology free retreat. 

I have checked out Canyon Ranch and the like, but everything seems very focused on how luxurious it is and not very focused on the ""soul"" work and/or mental work. 

I am looking for a retreat that is heavy on clean eating, yoga/meditation, and absolutely no phones. 

I am forgetting the name but I think there is one down in Florida that does this, with hiking and pretty much just eating nuts and berries.  

I am absolutely okay being the youngest person in the room, but not so okay with there being lots of men (sorry, men).

"We Stayed at Casa Familia in Punta Mita for a Creator Retreat: AMA! Just returned from a week at **Casa Familia**, a private 11-bedroom beachfront villa tucked inside the exclusive *Los Ranchos Estates* of Punta Mita, Mexico. We were there for a creator retreat hosted by Jeremy Austin and Angie, two pioneers in the luxury travel content space‚Äîand honestly, this place blew us away.

This wasn‚Äôt your typical villa rental. It felt more like stepping into someone‚Äôs meticulously run, deeply loved private home.

* Casual breakfasts made to order (fresh fruit, eggs, sausage, juices)
* Fresh fish tacos, guac, and salads for lunch
* Special dinners like pizza night (yes, wood-fired oven!) and sunset beach dinners
* Your drink is refilled without asking‚Äîit‚Äôs that level of service
* Housekeeping is ninja-level discreet. We‚Äôd leave and return to a refreshed room every time

# Experiences

* Whale watching *right from the villa‚Äôs pool deck* (peak season: Jan‚ÄìApril)
* Surfing at nearby La Lancha (less crowded than Sayulita)
* Access to Four Seasons and St. Regis Punta Mita for lunch or spa via the villa's golf cart
* Sunset drone footage of humpbacks breaching? Yep, we got that.
* Trails for biking/walking around Punta Mita‚Äôs 1,500-acre community

We visited in early March, and we got perfect weather every day. 

If you‚Äôre looking for a high-end escape where you can fully unplug and still be completely taken care of, Casa Familia hits the mark. The level of service felt like a boutique resort‚Äîbut with the privacy and personality of a beloved home.

"Casa Familia charges what they charge due to the influencers they let rent it out ;) It‚Äôs one of 20 lots in Ranchos that are all next to each other. I personally have a couple other favorites vs this one but this one gets a lot of publicity. 

But please edit as you don‚Äôt get access to the hotel amenities. You can make a spa or restaurant reservation, and you can have beach club at St R if you guarantee a min spend but you can‚Äôt use the facilities like you‚Äôre a hotel guest. 

But how fun that you did the retreat - I love his content! Some Qs: 1) what did you learn from it?
2) While I love his content, how he shoots is the same. So the more I see of it, the more numb I am to just being like oh, another drone shot. Do you think that will become a factor as he gets more widely known and more hotels ask him to shoot that everything will be the same?",comment_1,r/LuxuryTravel,Comedy,,https://www.reddit.com/r/LuxuryTravel/comments/1ks81ui/we_stayed_at_casa_familia_in_punta_mita_for_a/
"Thank you for sharing your thoughts. I always appreciate hearing different perspectives, especially from someone who clearly knows the Ranchos community well.   
  
Casa Familia is certainly a visually stunning villa, and I can understand why it‚Äôs such a draw for content creators. While it might not be everyone‚Äôs top choice, I can see why it garners attention thanks to its layout and aesthetic. üòä  
  
We did note that access to the Four Seasons and St. Regis is limited to dining and spa reservations, but I appreciate you flagging that again for clarity.  
  
As for the retreat, I‚Äôm so glad I participated! I walked away with a full presentation of tangible takeaways, from detailed photography and phone settings to 1:1 feedback on drone work and, perhaps most importantly, insight into what our hotel partners actually look for when hiring creators. As an advisor, I found it incredibly valuable to receive hands-on training from someone who collaborates directly with luxury brands.  
  
While I can‚Äôt speak for Jeremy‚Äôs long-term strategy, I believe his strength lies in delivering visually striking short-form content that resonates with luxury audiences in just 10‚Äì15 seconds. It‚Äôs that consistency and polished storytelling that keeps hotels bringing him back.

"Adult trip - 6 couples (12 people) Hi! 
We have a group looking to do an adult trip in late April / may 2026. We are looking for luxury, with activities and ideally a chef included. We hope to be able to stay in one house. Budget is around 15-20k a night. 

We are a group that likes to wake up, eat breakfast, do an activity, come back to the house and shower up for dinner/HH. 

Any suggestions on where we should go for 4-5 days? Location is most likely the US or Canada.

"US or Canada - I usually use Napa or Sonoma for what you're looking for.  There are some great estates available for full buyouts with private chefs, daily wine tastings, and then depending on what you're into, you can do hot air ballooning, vineyard tours, spa treatments etc. I also had a group do Jackson Hole, Wyoming.  They have great luxury ranches and mountain homes that can be staffed with chefs and concierge teams. It‚Äôs great if your group likes hiking, or wildlife, or spring skiing if you're early enough in the season.  You could even look at Amangani in Jackson Hole or a Relais & Ch√¢teaux estate rental in wine country - I've sent travelers to both, because sometimes it's hard to get a staff for the villas and it worked out perfectly.  Whistler in Canada may still have snow at the peaks in April, but by May, you can hike, bike, golf etc.  They have some great modern alpine mansion options with saunas, theaters, outdoor fire pits - great for a group.

"Looking for a boutique hotel or similar in Portugal Hi all,

I'm looking at taking my wife to Portugal next summer to celebrate her achieving a major professional milestone.  I'm hoping to find a boutique option, ideally on or near a beach, and am coming up kind of empty. We will be traveling with one child under the age of 2, so we'd like the support and amenities/conveniences that comes with staying at a hotel (as opposed to renting a private property). Any suggestions?

For reference, there are two places we have stayed that come to mind in terms of what I am looking for. First is the Azur Lodge in Queenstown, NZ. The Lodge is a collection of maybe 10-15 individual villas, along with one main common area. It had a private chef, an open bar every evening, and incredible service. The staff really wouldn't let you lift a finger there.

The second place I have in mind is the Hotel Wailea in Maui. It's is a Relais & Chateau property and each guest room is a suite. It's a lot bigger than the Azur Lodge but way smaller than something like a Four Seasons. The food was excellent and the service was impeccable.

Many thanks!",post,r/LuxuryTravel,Comedy,2.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/LuxuryTravel/comments/1kngatt/looking_for_a_boutique_hotel_or_similar_in/

"Take a look at Vila Monte Farm House in the Algarve. It‚Äôs not right on the beach but close enough for day trips, and it‚Äôs got that relaxed, refined atmosphere you expect in Relais & Ch√¢teaux properties.  It has whitewashed walls, citrus groves, and a great staff. I sent one of my families there (I‚Äôm a travel advisor) and they told me they went above and beyond for families traveling with young kids.

If you need to be closer to the beach, Praia do Canal Nature Resort might work. It‚Äôs a a big tucked into a Natural Park, so you‚Äôve got ocean views, a boutique property, and a more remote, peaceful setting. It‚Äôs newer, so it doesn‚Äôt always hit the radar, but service-wise it‚Äôs been getting strong reviews.

Another one with a similar spirit to Azur Lodge is Areias do Seixo‚Äîit‚Äôs stunning and sustainability-driven.  It is in the dunes north of Lisbon. I was hesitant to send families there because it is more adult-focused but I sent one with a toddler to the villas there and they had a lot for them to do. 

There are some inland options too (like around the Douro or Alentejo), but I think the proximity to water is important here so that should give you an idea.

	‚Ä¢	Strong Wi-Fi, family-friendly amenities, and a peaceful setting are all important

"Immigration issues for Indian Travellers Hey everyone, I am new to this sub. As a travel operator in Nepal had come across the travel case for Indian citizen today.

One of our clients was returning to Dubai today but the immigration did not allow him to pass through from Nepal. He was provided a letter that mentioned the NOC (No Objection Certificate) was not given to him by the Indian Embassy.

This is due to the recent war case between India and Pakistan. Even though my client had the Golden Visa for the UAE, he was not allowed to fly off of Nepal. He was not even allowed to go to India.

Please get advice from travel operators to the country you are going to or consult with your embassy.

"Hi Naresh,

I understand the complications your client faced while traveling through Nepal, especially with immigration restrictions due to the ongoing political situation. In Sri Lanka, we also face travel-related challenges due to various factors, like visa issues, political instability, or unexpected regulatory changes.

In Sri Lanka, it‚Äôs important to ensure that travelers have the necessary paperwork, including visa approval, NOC (No Objection Certificate) if required, and any other documents that may be necessary for international transit. For example, travelers from some countries may face scrutiny due to specific travel restrictions or diplomatic issues, so it‚Äôs vital to stay updated on the latest travel advisories from both the Sri Lankan government and the respective embassy.

I highly recommend consulting local travel operators who are well-versed with the regulations and can assist in preparing the necessary documentation to avoid any travel disruptions. Additionally, coordinating with the respective embassies can provide further clarity on requirements for international travel.

For your future travel planning or for any related assistance in Sri Lanka, I would suggest checking out Tourstro. They can provide personalized guidance and make the process smoother for both domestic and international travel.

Safe travels and best wishes for resolving the issue.",comment_3,r/LuxuryTravel,Comedy,,https://www.reddit.com/r/LuxuryTravel/comments/1kmix3u/immigration_issues_for_indian_travellers/

Montenegro Hi! Any advice for Montenegro? We are staying at a smaller hotel called the Huma hotel in Kotor bay as unfortunately o&o/chedi were booked for our dates save for family suites and villas. Has anyone stayed at the huma bay hotel before? We like fine dining and water adventure.

"Anyone stayed where? At huma hotel?

I was at o&o last week and its fantastic. What dates are you looking at ? If o&o is not available then Regent should be the next option in Porto Montenegro. If not that then Hyatt Regency. 

If you have any other questions let me know as I extensively toured the bay area last week",comment_1,r/LuxuryTravel,Comedy,,https://www.reddit.com/r/LuxuryTravel/comments/1kkq9ny/montenegro/

"Just Back from Borneo:  Rainforests and wild orangutans! One of our Travel Consultants just got back from Malaysian Borneo. If you‚Äôve been thinking about seeing orangutans in the wild, May is a great time. It‚Äôs the dry season but not peak tourist season yet, so it is less crowded.

Here‚Äôs what we experienced:.

**Kinabatangan River**  
  
Best spot if you're going with family. You take a boat from Sandakan, and you're in the middle of it. There are over 1100 wild orangutans here, as well as pygmy elephants, proboscis monkeys, crocs, and tons of birds. River lodges near Sukau or Bilit are great places to stay for the boat cruises. No trekking is needed, so it‚Äôs easy for kids. Pack dry bags and insect repellent. Mornings are best for sightings.

**Danum Valley**  
  
Good for couples or anyone dreaming of a real rainforest experience. This is an untouched jungle with no plantations, and we saw wild orangutans, bearded pigs, and a sun bear at night. There‚Äôs a canopy walkway, which is great for observing birds. It‚Äôs remote, so plan for at least three nights. Totally worth it.

**Tabin Wildlife Reserve**  
  
A bit more rugged. Fewer tourists. Wildlife comes to the mud volcanoes and saltwater springs. Good if you‚Äôre into photography or want a quieter experience. It‚Äôs humid and raw but feels very wild.

**What We Packed?**  
  
Light, long-sleeve shirts, Quick-dry pants, Rain jacket. Grippy waterproof shoes or sandals, Binoculars, Insect repellent, dry bags, flashlight or headlamp.

**Best time to visit Malaysia?**  
  
The dry season is from April to September.   
May had good weather and wasn‚Äôt crowded

**Who is This Good For?**  
  
Families: Kinabatangan is low-effort and full of sightings.   
Honeymooners: Danum is remote, quiet, and beautiful  
Solo travelers or nature nerds: Tabin or Danum are immersive and less touristy

"Trip review: Luxury Everest Base Camp Trek, brilliant experience First things first, I joined Reddit very recently as a few of my friends asked me to and one of the first subs I joined is this, too, and yeah, loved it every way. No, what about my trip? 

Thank you so so so much for the recommendation of Everest Luxury Holidays from this sub. The team was one of the most fascinating I've ever worked with. I have travelled with a few high-end companies, and this one was for sure different. And what they have been doing in the travel industry of their country, and their team has been doing it locally, is really great. They deserved this review, so I am writing. I have also asked the guy to join this sub, and he might be extremely happy to see these two posts, and I really appreciate them.

Now, about my trip: 

I did the Everest Base Camp Trek with my stay at Luxury Lodges named Yeti Mountain Home up to this place called Debuche. No doubt, their hospitality, in-house services, food, rooms, and everything are just brilliant. I read about these lodges for years, so I always had in mind that if I ever went, I would stay at 'em because lots of WoM. So, to those who are going to experience real luxury in Everest then do not go beyond Debuche on walking. Tbh, the lodges in Dingboche and Lobuche were the worst ones, but we opted for it despite our operator's warning about them. I don't regret doing it cause I really respect what the locals have done in such harsh weather conditions for at least 3-4 months continuously and without the technology the polar countries have. All they have with them is their Bakkhu dress, which is pretty warm, but unwashed for months and tonnes of things.

About my guide and porters: 

Oh boy, never met such humble people who are there just for you, but nothing else. You talk to families, you socialise with 'em, you know how many members their family has, you look at their childhood photo albums, you listen to their dreams and boy, you can hear them talk every day. I think we westerners have forgotten the way of socialisation, it has opened my eyes, and for sure I will promote this idea of conversation for sure to everyone.

Our porters Dhan Bahadur, Shukra, and Padam are super humans. I think we had the total weight of 36-37 kgs, which got divided into 3 different duffels and boy, they carried them the whole day without stopping at places and a lot more. I will talk about the flaws of the situation in the country later on. But maaaaan, it can't be for real that they are not treated well at any place in the trail, they had to go somewhere to sleep, and were not paid enough. But I clearly wanted to know how much they were being paid for my trip; they didn't tell me how much, but I came to know they were paid double the salaries that any other people would be paid. I came to know about it later from Naresh that they were paid NPR 3000 (¬£20-22) per day, which, by conversion, is pretty hefty for people to earn per day.

About the beauty of the trail: 

Now, about the beauty, no comparison. Been to Canada? Well, it's got too many lakes alongside the mountains, but the Everest region, too many mountains. You walk right on their lap. Every day it's so so so so so beautiful and you can't get enough of them. You question your own existence over these mighty rocks.

But I didn't just hike, in fact. I had pretty good expectations from the operator for what I had read about them, and they met them pretty well. I flew in a helicopter from Kathmandu to Lukla and trekked the same day to Phakding (our plan was a bit ahead to Monjo, but I couldn't walk as my group did). The second day was even harder with around 7 hrs of walking to Namche Bazaar, which made me realise that, well, now I couldn't just walk but even climb Everest, haha. But it was a superb day. Another family-friend couple with us did the bungee jump on the way to Everest. I didn't, though. What made these walks interesting is talking about the history of the region, on how the people from the Hills came and how Tibetans came and how the originals are now living in harmony.

We visited 2 Sherpa Families, one of whom were pretty much lived up to their expectations that never made them come out of the villages. All the males did was become guides or porters, while the females looked after the houses. We had one lunch planned at their house. Now I feel that I have lived my life in so much comfort that observing what life is on the flip side of the world makes me cry. But boy, these people do not want anything, just a normal life, a happy life, food that fills your tummy.

Although the Everest Region is a way commercial trekking route to the extent I experienced, visiting that family hit right at us. Now, if you ask why we went, because we wanted to explore the reality and beyond, and that‚Äôs what we planned for.

About the toughness of the trip: 

It is not for the faint-hearted. Do not attempt if you are not well prepared. No matter how fit you are, it is going to affect everybody once you go beyond the tree line. But do not be sceptical about the altitude. If you are well prepared physically and mentally, which is what we pretty much did, got everything on and followed the basics to ‚Äúeat enough, drink enough, and sleep enough‚Äù. Never rushed to walk either. The everyday average walk was of around 5-6 hours, up hills and downhills.

For altitude, we had Acetazolamide (Diamox tablets), easily available in almost every Pharmacy in Kathmandu. We had our guide bought for us.

Hotels we stayed at: 

In Kathmandu, we chose Dwarika‚Äôs. Pretty big hotel in size, so expect a lot of people over there. But it was really worth it. Our rooms were deluxe, beautifully architectured with the ethnic design of Newari Homes of Kathmandu. So, this should be your first choice when you get to Kathmandu.

During the trek, we stayed at Yeti Mountain Home. Yeti Mountain Home is a chain of hotels operated by Mountain Lodges of Nepal. They have beautiful properties starting from Lukla itself up to Debuche, actually up to a place called Kongde (I did not go there either, getting there again next year with a different trip, I am suggesting the trip at the end).

Yeti Mountain Homes are really great. Luxurious lodges at those remote areas. Really warm hospitality of the staff. The food is great, too.

But Dingboche and onwards, nothing is luxurious. You have to adjust to whatever you get. Our hotel was pre-booked at Tashi Delek Lodge, an upgraded version of what basic means over there. You get an ensuite bathroom, too, but not so good, and the flush does not work here due to extreme cold, so scooping for flushing is what you need to do. Lobuche is even worse tbh. But I should not complain, as maintaining this is extraordinary.

Our transfers: 

We used the helicopter to go and return. There is the option of twin-otter flight as well, but I heard that to catch the flight, you had to drive early morning, around 4-5 hours and then get it. What if the flight cancels in those places, the hotels might not be good either. Thus, I was from the very beginning suggested to fly in the helicopter, so, did it and it was worth it.

Even flying out was the same case, we flew from Gorakshep in the helicopter to Khumjung, stayed there for a few hours and flew back to Kathmandu. And to anyone hiking here, visit Khumjung on the day of your acclimatisation in Namche. It is one of the most Sherpa villages I saw throughout.

But about the helicopters, be prepared that they might make you wait sometimes. We waited for 2 hours in Khumjung for the heli to arrive. But it was worth it.

About our Operator: 

Yep, I chose the recommendation from this sub and chose Everest Luxury Holidays for my Nepal Holiday from the recommendation by a lady in this sub.

I actually paid a hefty money to the operator to make sure the trip was flexible if I wanted to make some change in the middle that might interest me to elongate my stay, and y'know what they never talked about ‚Äúwe will look into it if it is available, rather they said, buddy, it's not like we cannot arrange two rooms in there, but we need to know a day earlier.‚Äù Guess what, there was another post on this sub, too, that asked about the adventure hiking stuff, and I got a rec of a place named Khumjung. I instantly asked my guide Narayan, to see if it was possible to visit the place on return. He made a call, I got the call back instantly, and boom, Naresh agreed to do it. So I extended my day by one more, and I can't tell you how seamless it was.

When I told you we had to wait for the helicopter to arrive in Khumjung for 2 hours, I was not very happy about doing the wait. But the weather in Lukla was pretty bad for them to take off, so we understood the situation and waited. But Naresh connected with me at that time and asked if I would like to meet a Sherpa Climber who has already left climbing Everest for years now. I could not say no to it.

I remember drinking a butter tea (it's basically tea but they put the Himalayan Ghee on it a little bit to keep you warm and call it the butter tea) with Dorji, the climber and talking about his experience, looking at his family. Dorji usually lives in Kathmandu, but at that time happened to be there for a few months because he wanted to stay for a while in his homeland, guarding it and at least farming potatoes in his lands. He had a few relatives alongside him yesterday, and it was pretty great to meet all of them. The wait of 2 hours was nothing while meeting him. And now I know why the previous post about them praised the organisation of the trip so well.

Oh, almost forgot, we were welcomed by a local ethnic musical band at the airport, who did such a grand welcome, they did. Really fascinating.

My last day, today, in Kathmandu: 

Well, I was supposed to be resting today as I am flying out, but I haven‚Äôt got enough from this country. I will surely come back next year, I have already paid my deposit to them.

Yes, about today, I got to meet one more family of former Kumari in Patan. Kumari is considered a living goddess in Kathmandu. She is selected by a priest in each of Kathmandu and Patan before her menstruation. I am not going to spoil the history and her selection process. But when I got to meet the former one, I got to know how restricted her life could have been if she had to follow every ritual after her tenure had ended, but now they all live a free life like anybody else. But she is the first to be worshipped in her family before anything else. She is still considered the Goddess by her and her family members, which does not fascinate her every time, but she respects the culture and adjusts to it.

Flaws in the country and the trip:

1.	‚Å†So many delays are to be expected for flights. To flight out of Kathmandu had a 1.5-hour delay due to air traffic. While flying back, as well as the weather, and air traffic. So, be prepared for it.

2.	‚Å†‚Å†Porters: They are the ones who carry everything in the region, from tourists to their loads and luggage. But they are the ones mostly mistreated. I saw many porters even carrying 100+ kgs on their backs. Yet they are underpaid. Proud that my porters were not in such a condition. I was clearly informed that if any baggage is more than 15 kgs, then we had to hire one more person because they did not want to kill them like other people do. And yes, many of them do not even get to sleep at the lodges we sleep at; they are driven away by the owners, like slaves. This was the thing I really hated. Our porters, though, even got the room allowances and were given rooms at the guide and porter section, depending on availability. I really had to raise this issue, so here it is on everything I experienced, and everything made true.

Cost Breakdown: 

Our trip cost was given to us on the basis of 4 people in 2 rooms sharing:

Hotel in Kathmandu (The Dwarika‚Äôs): ¬£2,060

Helicopter Ride (the first plan Kathmandu-Lukla-Gorakshep-Kathmandu and additional Gorakshep to Khumjung and connect to Kathmandu): ¬£8500

Trekking cost (Accommodation, Meals, Guides, Porters, Permits, excursions, and activities that needed management like visits with families-donations, monastery entrances): ¬£ 7295

Extra costs (Meals in Kathmandu, Tours in Kathmandu, Guide, Entrance Fees, Transfers, Misc.): ¬£ 2000

Total cost: ¬£19855 (¬£4965 per person)

Itinerary we did:

Day 1: Arrive in Kathmandu

Day 2: Fly to Lukla and Trek to Phakding

Day 3: Trek to Namche Bazaar

Day 4: Acclimatize in Namche Bazaar

Day 5: Trek to Debuche

Day 6: Trek to Dingboche

Day 7: Acclimatize in Dingboche

Day 8: Trek to Lobuche

Day 9: Trek to Everest Base Camp and fly to Lukla and back to Kathmandu

Day 10: Explore Kathmandu

Day 11: Departure

We re-edited Day 9, flew to Khumjung, stayed there for 1 night and flew back the next day, that is yesterday.

Now my suggestion to do according to Narayan and my next year's trip: 

Day 1: Arrive in Kathmandu

Day 2: Fly to Lukla and Trek to Phakding

Day 3: Trek to Namche Bazaar

Day 4: Acclimatize in Namche Bazaar (go to Khumjung Village)

Day 5: Trek to Debuche

Day 6: Trek to Kongde

Day 7: Fly to Everest Base Camp or Gorakshep and sleep 1 night at Base Camp

Day 8: Fly to Kathmandu or keep 1 buffer day in case weather does not allow the heli to fly

Day 9: Explore Kathmandu

Day 10: Departure

Luxury travel advisor here! Keep in mind a lot of islands close up shop in sept/oct (I.e Turks and Caicos). Some hotels will remain open but all the surrounding restaurants and shops will be closed. I‚Äôd choose something south of the hurricane belt or Mexico.

"I would highly recommend Como Parrot Cay (on its own island though so limited to the restaurants there) or Amanyara (mainland) both in Turks and Caicos. There are also some great luxury villa companies here that would come with a chef, butler, concierge, etc. if you would be okay not being on a resort. 

Some other options would be Jumby Bay or Hermitage Bay in Antigua or Cap Jaluca in Anguilla.

"Once You‚Äôve Been, You‚Äôre Never Quite the Same: The Long Bay Effect **Once You‚Äôve Been, You‚Äôre Never Quite the Same: The Long Bay Effect**

There are some places that you visit, and then there are places that visit you‚Äîquietly, wholly, without asking. Long Bay Beach in Turks and Caicos is one of those rare places. You arrive with your suitcase and maybe a few expectations, but you leave with something far more lasting: a feeling that‚Äôs impossible to name but impossible to forget.

It doesn‚Äôt hit all at once. Maybe it starts when your feet sink into the powder-fine sand, the kind that‚Äôs so soft it squeaks beneath your toes. Or maybe it‚Äôs when you realize the water changes color every time you glance at it‚Äîicy aqua one moment, glowing sapphire the next. It‚Äôs mesmerizing, like the island is constantly repainting the sky and sea just for you.

But Long Bay isn‚Äôt just beautiful. It‚Äôs intimate. Quiet. Almost like it knows the world gets loud sometimes, and it wanted to make space for your stillness. There‚Äôs something about the way the breeze carries across the sea grass, or how the palms don‚Äôt rush‚Äîhow nothing here does, really. You start to slow down too. Not just your pace, but your thoughts. Your breath. The way you hold yourself.

Then there are the people. The locals don‚Äôt welcome you like a guest. They welcome you like family. There‚Äôs a depth to their kindness, a warmth that isn‚Äôt performative or polite‚Äîit‚Äôs personal. You don‚Äôt just feel safe here. You feel seen.

And somewhere in that slow, golden stretch of afternoon light, something shifts. You start to understand why so many people come here once and never quite leave‚Äîat least, not emotionally. You understand that ‚Äúvacation‚Äù was never the right word. This is something else entirely. It‚Äôs coming home to a part of yourself you didn‚Äôt know you were missing.

You can try to explain it when you return. You can show pictures of sunsets and turquoise waves and smiling faces. But no photo, no story, no souvenir ever quite captures what it feels like to be changed by a place. That part is just for you.

Long Bay doesn‚Äôt demand your attention‚Äîit earns your love. And once it has it, you carry it with you. Everywhere.",post,r/LuxuryTravel,Comedy,0.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/LuxuryTravel/comments/1kd5chx/once_youve_been_youre_never_quite_the_same_the/

\- The Goring - Old-fashioned luxury hotel. Holds a royal warrant. The late Queen Mother was a regular, and the Princess of Wales stayed there before her wedding. It‚Äôs around St James‚Äôs Palace, quite secluded.

\- Raffles London at the OWO (Old War Office) - One of the newest luxury hotels in London, on Whitehall, around No 10 Downing Street; National Gallergy‚Äôs up the road.

Others to consider: old world hotels like Claridge‚Äôs, the Connaught, and the Savoy (on the river); modern luxury like the Lanesborough and the Peninsula; not old world, but not completely modern, hotels like the Dorchester on Park Lane and the Mandarin Oriental Hyde Park.

"Best Places to Experience Culture in Sri Lanka **Kandy**

Kandy is a very special city in Sri Lanka. It has the famous Temple of the Tooth, where a sacred tooth of Buddha is kept. You can also see traditional dance shows and explore local markets. If you visit in July or August, don‚Äôt miss the Esala Perahera festival, a big street parade with dancers, drummers, and elephants. It‚Äôs an amazing experience!

**Anuradhapura**

Anuradhapura is one of the oldest cities in the country. It has huge ancient temples and the very old Bodhi Tree, which is over 2,000 years old. It‚Äôs a quiet and peaceful place where people still do Buddhist prayers. It‚Äôs great if you want to see the religious side of Sri Lanka.

**Polonnaruwa**

Polonnaruwa is a city full of old stone temples and statues from many years ago. It‚Äôs calm and easy to walk around. You can really feel the history when you visit. This is a good place if you like learning about the past.

**Dambulla**

Dambulla is known for its amazing Cave Temples. Inside the caves, there are many paintings and statues of Buddha. The caves are cool and quiet, and it feels like a peaceful place to visit.

**Jaffna**

Jaffna is very different from the south of Sri Lanka. It has a lot of Tamil culture, with Hindu temples and busy markets. It‚Äôs not very touristy, so you can see how local people really live.

"As far as where to go, I have a few ideas.  

I think you might really enjoy Tuscany. Renting a villa there is lovely because you don't have to constantly pack and unpack, and it's comfortable and safe. You could hire a local driver or join group tours, which is quite common, so you don't have to worry about navigating roads yourself. Tuscany of course is full of incredible scenery, amazing food, and friendly locals.

Provence in France - also beautiful and relaxed, has those charming small towns, amazing food, and a gorgeous  countryside. You could stay near Aix-en-Provence or Saint-R√©my, and again, hiring a private driver is pretty standard and convenient, especially if you're exploring vineyards or local markets.

More exotic (and further depending on where you are coming from) - New Zealand's South Island is another gorgeous option. Queenstown and the surrounding area are incredibly safe and welcoming, with some of the most stunning landscapes you'll ever see. The food and hospitality are excellent, and it's easy to arrange comfortable private tours or drivers.

Japan, (especially Kyoto or Hakone) is incredibly safe, peaceful, and welcoming for solo travelers. Staying in a traditional ryokan inn with a private hot spring is a unique experience, and the food scene there is phenomenal. Plus, locals are genuinely friendly and helpful.

As for planning your trip, I recommend [Evyssa Vacations.](https://www.evyssavacations.com/) They handle all the little details and logistics beautifully. They are very thorough and genuinely care about their travelers.

"Creating a cinematic travel experience ‚Äî part luxury, part myth. Would you do something like this? Hey travelers! I‚Äôm helping design a unique high-end experience deep in the Gobi Desert. It‚Äôs more than just a tour ‚Äî it‚Äôs a journey that blends luxury, local heritage, and just enough mystery to feel like you‚Äôre stepping into a living story.

Here‚Äôs the vibe:
	‚Ä¢	Guests arrive and slowly transition into an immersive desert realm over 8‚Äì9 days.
	‚Ä¢	You travel via Land Cruisers, ride camels, or even try dune buggies through vast, untouched landscapes.
	‚Ä¢	Instead of ordinary hotels, you stay in beautifully designed desert domes and tents ‚Äî minimalist but meaningful, inspired by nomadic life.
	‚Ä¢	Guests wear custom-designed desert robes and gear ‚Äî nothing too cosplay, but enough to make you feel part of something bigger.
	‚Ä¢	There are rituals, fireside moments, desert games, and symbolic tokens you earn through your choices.
	‚Ä¢	You might wake to a note left by someone unknown‚Ä¶ or find yourself part of a clan tasked with a secret role.
	‚Ä¢	You don‚Äôt have to engage in the deeper story‚Ä¶ but if you do, the Realm will notice.

It‚Äôs designed for curious adventurers who love both luxury and mystery ‚Äî people who want more than just pretty views. We‚Äôre testing ideas now and would love your thoughts:
	‚Ä¢	Would this style of immersive travel appeal to you?
	‚Ä¢	Do you prefer structure or mystery when it comes to high-end trips?
	‚Ä¢	What makes a travel experience truly unforgettable for you?

Appreciate any feedback. We‚Äôre trying to build something soulful, not just marketable ‚Äî something that leaves you wondering if it was real, even after you‚Äôve returned.",post,r/LuxuryTravel,Comedy,2.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/LuxuryTravel/comments/1k61p1r/creating_a_cinematic_travel_experience_part/
"IMHO this is not how wealthy people travel and you aren't particularly describing a luxury experience 

This appeals to a upscale middle income demographic, especially if the game-ifcation is geared towards kids or teens.

"I agree. This seems like a niche idea, probably suited to the 18-30 market looking for an adventure, and possibly even younger, but for a luxury holiday, I would not consider it. It's been a long time since I stayed in a tent, and combined with the games and clothing, I don't see the appeal personally. I know you say it's optional, but you would quickly feel out of place if you were not partaking in the events. 

To give some context, we have been to the Antarctic and stayed in a camp as a family, so I'm not adverse to extremes.",comment_3,r/LuxuryTravel,Comedy,,https://www.reddit.com/r/LuxuryTravel/comments/1k61p1r/creating_a_cinematic_travel_experience_part/
I can't really criticize it without a deeper understanding of the program and the various immersive qualities guests will experience. I just saw a mismatch between the luxury travel markets and this product. The idea itself is sound and I think there is probably a lot of growth potential with creating an ecosystem of different adventures or experiences around the world that cater to different interests and perhaps share a similar storyline or thematic elements.,comment_4,r/LuxuryTravel,Comedy,,https://www.reddit.com/r/LuxuryTravel/comments/1k61p1r/creating_a_cinematic_travel_experience_part/

"Easy Family Travel Tips for Sri Lanka **Mix Fun with Learning**

Visit different places like old temples and ancient cities around the country. Go on animal safaris in Yala, Udawalawe, Wilpattu, and Minneriya. Relax at beaches like Unawatuna, Mirissa, Arugam Bay, and Trincomalee (from the south to the east coast). There's something for everyone to enjoy.

**Stay in Family Friendly Hotels**

Choose hotels with big rooms, swimming pools, and space for kids to play. Some even have fun activities.

**Travel Comfortably**

Traveling in buses or trains can be stressful with kids. Hiring a car with a driver is easier and more comfortable and time saving for long trips.

**Keep Everyone Healthy**

Drink bottled water, use mosquito spray, and bring snacks, sunscreen, and a small first aid kit for any little problems.

**Enjoy Local Life**

People in Sri Lanka are very kind to children. Try new foods, fruits and cultural habits and chat with locals, and enjoy the friendly culture.",post,r/LuxuryTravel,Comedy,7.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/LuxuryTravel/comments/1k5t8bo/easy_family_travel_tips_for_sri_lanka/

"Crete, Greece - June 10-24 üåû Hi there! I'm Mark, 30M and from the Netherlands. I'm planning a two week trip to Crete. I don't mind going there by myself, but honestly it's a lot more fun to share the experience. So I'm hoping to find a positive, open-minded, and goofy travel buddy to join me! üòä

Some things I like to do when traveling: sightseeing and exploring the culture, trying different foods, checking some shops. Hiking in nature, taking nice pictures, swimming, beach days and just soaking up the sun. Maybe a bit of biking or something adventurous. Sipping cocktails, beers and enjoying a bit of nightlife (but definitely don't like a party-hard-every-night kind of trip)

I like to balance activities with downtime - one day could be a full-day trip exploring, and the next might be more chill, maybe some sightseeing in the afternoon and then relaxing. I believe a vacation should definitely also be relaxing and rushing around trying to see as much as possible is not for me.

A little about me: I‚Äôm easily distracted by cute animals, so expect me to point them out in the middle of a conversation... I love trying new foods, people-watching, and getting lost in a good board or video game. Other things that make me happy are sipping tea or cocktails, tending to my plants, swimming, and, of course, going on adventures and exploring new places! I have a warm and easy-going personality and hope you do too. Here's two pics of me:¬†[1](https://imgur.com/OAg44vH),¬†[2](https://imgur.com/gUqXpnD)

"What are the most important places for you? I've been to most of the places you mentioned, and I assure you that you won't be able to fit all of it (reasonably) into your schedule.  
I also plan on being out that way, although I planned on arriving later in May and leaving in early July - but i'll be doing a much larger trip in general.

  
I'd also suggest Capital Reef, Goblin Valley, and Canyonlands since you'll be driving by them already and they are definitely superior to a few spots on that list. I'd further recommend nixing Four Corners (tourist trap, unless it has special meaning to you) and RMNP/Sand Dunes/Mesa - save those for a future trip that is Colorado specific. That would make your trip much more manageable (you could spend 1 day at each: Zion, Bryce, Capital Reef, Arches, Canyonland. That gives you a float day for any of the places you like in particular. If you are really interested in sand dunes, coral pink sand dunes in UT is something you'll basically be driving by as well (I believe its a state park IIRC).

I'll give some thought to coming out early and potentially joining for a day or two just for fun; It's always nice to have a buddy. May 26 is also a new moon, and I'm big into Astrophotography - so it'd be cool since you'd be camping and I'd likely stay late into the night. Lastly, it'd be nice to practice my german which I haven't made much use of in over a decade - I could likely uphold a child-like conversation as well as a german toddler on a sugar high, lol.

Give some thought to what I shared - I strongly strongly encourage you to reconsider/prioritize your destinations as the UT parks + CO parks are just not feasible all together in that timeframe IMO.

"Thanks for your reply and recommendations!

The thing is that I leave the country in New York and the next spots on my list are in Texas and New Orleans. Thats why I kind of need to be in Denver at the end of this trip, because I want to take a train / Bus from there.

I got your points with not visiting all of the spots to fit it reasonable in my schedule, that makes sense. Bryce Canyon, Zion Canyon and Monement Valley is probably the most important for me in Utah. The Rocky Mountains in Colorado are also important for me.

Would you still be down for some of the spots in Utah?
We could definitely arrange that with your German:)",comment_2,r/travelmeetup,Comedy,,https://www.reddit.com/r/travelmeetup/comments/1jwhgse/travel_buddy_las_vegas_denver/

I wouldn't recommend visiting until July or August though, as late may and June is black fly season :( Haha.

As for the trip, I'll see if I can make flights and such work! I was already loosely looking at the idea of coming a bit early and hitting a few of the nightclubs; perhaps arriving on the 20th. When you say 25th to 31st, is that starting on the 25th? If so that could work out nicely. I could probably join for a couple days, but then I'd aim to skedaddle back towards Vegas as I anticipate doing my trip clockwise (for weather/climate reasons).

I'll see what I can do, and if it works out, I'll privately message you :D

Edit: Keep in mind I'd be driving my own rental (Since I couldn't join you all the way to Denver) - so you'd still have one spot in your car/it wouldn't help offset costs.

* Mainly based in Kyoto
* Side trips to Hiroshima (and Miyajima) and Osaka
* Four nights in Tokyo before flying out of Haneda

"[37NB] Last minute trip to Tokyo / Japan (May 22 - May 28) With an American long weekend coming up and a few extra PTO days available, I happened to find an extremely good flight discount to Tokyo, so I'm heading there in a couple weeks! I land Thursday May 22 at 8pm in Tokyo, and I will leave Wednesday May 28 evening. A friend couldn't join last minute due to passport issues, so I'll be traveling solo.

Flying from San Francisco, and I've been to Japan over 15 times (and studied abroad in Kyoto many years ago).

About me:

* Speak moderate Japanese (enough to get around, but not enough to have political discussions, lol)

* Non-binary/queer, and into LGBTQ+ nightlife & bars

* No food restrictions, and love all sorts of Japanese food; would love a partner for a nice sushi omakase one night

* Not budget restrained, so if anyone wants to do something unique that's a bit pricier, I could be down

* Love adventure, so completely open to ANY itinerary changes (in Tokyo, or all across the country, potentially)

* Anything super unique / weird is a plus (visiting strange bars and niche performance venues is really fun)

* Active and fit (so sports-y activities are totally OK)

* Geeky/nerdy too ‚Äì¬†video & board games, anime/manga, etc. (been to Akiba many times)

* Unique / subculture clothing shopping can be super fun (big fan of La Foret boutique shops)

* Love cats, so even chilling at a cat cafe is totally fine

* Willing to travel around the country too; I love going to hot springs in the mountains

* Also curious about nailing down an artist to get my first tattoo in Japan",post,r/travelpartners,Comedy,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/travelpartners/comments/1klvjc1/37nb_last_minute_trip_to_tokyo_japan_may_22_may_28/

"Need advice on first camping trip Hi guys. I'm a 25M from Delhi, India. I have been planning to go to this isolated village Milam in uttarakhand. The elevation is about 4250m above sea level. And its really high up in the himalayas. It used to be a bustling trading town before the 1962 Indo-sino war. There is an Indian Army outpost nearby there too. The trek is from the most nearby town Munsyari, it's almost 50ish km. I am thinking of camping in Minal. I am pretty excited to practice bushcraft and living on my own for 5 days there, but I don't have any camping experience. I am renting most of my gear (tent, sleeping bag, cooking stove etc.). But mostly my only worry is the wilderness there. Since Milam is high up in the himalayas and is away from civilisation, there is a lot of fauna in the nearby areas to it, there is a national park nearby too. The elevation area of the himalayas is known to have black bears, snow leopards, pit vipers. Although there have been no reports of finding them in Milam, but it is in the biodiversity area. Could you help me out with any advice so I can avoid the animals. Thanks.

"We have Black Bears and Big Cats here in the Rockies; so I can base some advice around that.

1) You need to rethink this whole trip, 5 days of back country camping is a lot for a first trip, let alone solo. You‚Äôre lucky there is an army base nearby, because it‚Äôs very likely you‚Äôll need to be rescued, or bail and leave all your gear behind crawling out suffering elevation sickness.

2) Elevation is no joke, and 4250m/13,000ft is going to be brutal coming from ~300m/1000ft. Expect painful headaches.

3) Do not eat near your campsite, 30m/100ft is a good starting distance. Bears and Big Cats will be attracted to your food smells, and general camp odors.

4) Keep your camp and eating area tidy.

5) Be Noisy, talk to yourself, stomp around camp, just be generally noisier than usual.

5) Double check with someone more familiar with the area (that NPs rangers?), our local pit vipers (rattlesnakes) typically don‚Äôt live far into the mountains, it may be similar in your area.",comment_1,r/WildernessBackpacking,Comedy,,https://www.reddit.com/r/WildernessBackpacking/comments/1kttv0r/need_advice_on_first_camping_trip/

"Help replacing straps on a vintage German alpine rucksack? I picked up a vintage German alpine rucksack (photos attached). Canvas body, metal fittings- great shape overall, but the original straps are missing.



I want to fit it with comfortable, padded canvas straps (preferably not nylon/polyester). The top has metal loops, and the bottom has clamp-style hardware for threading. The straps need to be 2cm wide.



I plan to:

* Use cotton canvas webbing (2cm)
* Add some cushioned padding
* Use buckles at the bottom for adjustment



My questions:

* Should I thread the top loops or use clips?
* Is doubling webbing for strength worth it?
* Are there any UK or international sources for canvas webbing, cushioned padding, and hardware?

"You can find cotton canvas webbing online. It might take some searching to find 2 cm.

I'd sew the webbing onto the top metal loops. Then run it down to the ladder buckle at the bottom.  Make sure the webbing you get works with the buckle before you sew it on - they can be picky sometimes.

I think I'd make the shoulder strap pads so that they slide on the straps, so you can adjust them. I'm picturing canvas oblongs, like three inches wide by a foot long - two layers each side. 

Not sure about what to put inside for padding. Something appropriate for that time would be kapok, but it'll be sewn inside so you can't see it. Anyway, put the padding in between two of the oblongs, and sew a lighter weight fabric edging around the perimeter - like is done on the edge of the top flap on the pack.  

You'll end up with two shoulder pad shaped things. Then sew another piece of the webbing about 4"" long, from side to side on each end of the shoulder pads to make a loop that lays flat against the shoulder pad - so you can slide them over the straps you sewed on the bag already. I'm sure that's all clear as mud...

You might look at some websites with weird surplus packs on them and see if there is one that it looks like you could swap the straps off of. Might work (might not).

Lower 48 States. 5-days of actual trail time. 100 miles or less if on trail, 65 miles or less if off trail. I currently do 20-25 mile days in the Adirondacks and The Whites pretty consistently. I run 7-10 miles a day. So given the trail condition/altitude trade-off, I think I can maintain that pace out west. I'd like a nice mix of big mountain passes, conifer trees when low and alpine lakes and tundra up high. I will be going Late August or early September. Views... Also, I'm perfectly fine with heavy black bear activity but I'm kind of afraid of grizzlies- not enough to deter from a trip. 

So far I'm debating between Andrew Skurka's Yosemite High Route - The Southern Loop Section and the Teton Crest Trail. The YHR: 65 miles, a significant chunk off trail. Yosemite back country needs no explanation. this trip would be hard, remote and glorious. The TCT: Looks epic but a little short for 5 days on trail. Also considering the High Sierra Trail, and something in The Winds. 

  
Any advice would be awesome and feel free to throw in a trip I've overlooked.",post,r/WildernessBackpacking,Comedy,122.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/WildernessBackpacking/comments/1ks55ix/wife_approved_solo_backpacking_hallpass_what_is/
"Take a look at the Wind Rivers in Wyoming, high passes, so many lakes many are not named, world class fishing, absolute high granite haven.

"What time of year are you thinking? I vote Yosemite but no matter where you pick, consider wildfire season. Assuming no/limited snow, I wouldn't do Yosemite after about mid-June unless you want to run the risk of your trip being cut short or canceled entirely due to fires. Twice now I've been to Yosemite (in July and September) and both times wildfires and wildfire smoke especially impacted my trip.

I would also consider the Tahoe Rim Trail,\* but again, wildfires. Generally speaking, if you're traveling from afar, the sooner you get out in California after the snow melts, the better).

Now I'm dying to know your wife's trip too! Where is she going??

I have backpacked  and horsepacked most of the Winds over about a 40 year period and taking a horse in for the first day is worth the effort to get lined up. With the right outfitter you can stay at their place on the edge of the wilderness and go first thing in the morning after a big breakfast. It really adds a whole dimension to the experience and puts you at altitude at the end of the first day. One outfit provided transportation to and from the airport in Jackson Hole.,comment_3,r/WildernessBackpacking,Comedy,,https://www.reddit.com/r/WildernessBackpacking/comments/1ks55ix/wife_approved_solo_backpacking_hallpass_what_is/

"I have 100 backpacks, headlamps, and sleeping pads/bags and don‚Äôt know what to do with them I turned my passion for backpacking into a business back in 2018 and ended up planning backpacking trips and outfitting over 1000 people.  It was a great experience!

Fast forward 7 years.. I closed the business. I now have a ton of backpacking equipment. Many of the items have only been used 1-3 times because I frequently sold gear and ordered new at wholesale prices to keep it fresh.  Backpacks, sleeping bags, sleeping pads, headlamps, Nalgenes, maps, new pillows, trekking poles, food, etc.

I‚Äôve tried slowly selling it off and have had friends help me, but I‚Äôm selling my house now and I refuse to move all this equipment anymore.  So what can I do with it all?

Does anyone have ideas?  I‚Äôd prefer to monetize it somehow, as I never made much from the business.  The gear accumulated while my bank account depleted haha.. If I absolutely cannot find a way to monetize it quickly, I‚Äôd be open to donating it if it was a good cause.

"If you're in the eastern half of Iowa, I think Pictured Rocks in the Upper Peninsula of MI *might* be within your 10 hour drive limit? If so, I highly recommend the North County Trail, it's not a loop but they run a shuttle along the trail in the summers (or at least they did 4 years ago when I went, it was like $5-10 per person I think). It's a National Shoreline so it's run by the NPS so you do have to make backcountry reservations and book the shuttle if you want it (I parked, shuttled to my starting point, and hiked back to my car over 3 days). I took my partner-at-the-time there for a short section of trail along the National Shoreline for his first backpacking trip. It was one of my favorite 3 day, 2 night trips it was so beautiful! You could definitely do 7-10 mile days for sure. I've been wanting to go back to do the whole trail, I think it's 40-something miles total and we did about 30. It was a great first trip for him too!

"Sleeping bag advice needed I am most definitely not the first or last to make a post like this in here. Sorry about that. But I could really use some advice. I have been browsing sleeping bags for weeks now. Both in local shops and on the web. I just can't figure out what to buy.

I have mostly been hiking, but I am getting more and more into mountaineering. I have done some smaller mountain hikes (Norway, Switzerland, Iceland and more), and also a short ice climbing course. I am not planning anything crazy, but I would like to slowly level up a bit, doing multiday trips and to get some experience. E.g. I am planning to do Monte Argentera(Italy) this June. Also I am going to travel a lot with my job the next year. Going for both Greenland, Canada, Alaska and Seattle. So there is definitely going to be some good opportunities there as well. At least some hiking.

That brings me to the point. I think I am looking for something in the comfort temperature around -5C/25F give or take. Guess that will be roughly temperature limit -10C/15F. Something a bit versatile. I am not planning to sleep super cold any of these places, so I guess a good warm 3-seasoner should be fine? Please let me know if you think something else. My Dream is to someday do something similar to MT. Rainier when I get the experience, but I don't know if that would require a new sleeping bag anyways?

I of course also want it to be light and compact(when packed), however I tend to get a little claustrophobic in those super tight mummy bags. Also it is a huuge plus, if I can zip up in the foot area. As my feet tend to get very hot while sleeping.

I have of course been looking a lot at different bags already. I have narrowed it down to a few I find interesting. But at the same time I also see some cons with all of them:

[Sea to Summit Ascent Down 15](https://seatosummit.eu/en-dk/products/the-ascent-down-sleeping-bag?srsltid=AfmBOoqo0AQsSYrmsk1m2tO3wxsDpOvq7GfNYUwhHM3RGuxOy7-PLKwj)¬†can get it for around $375

\+: Has a ton of zip features(can open at the feet), has descent weight(1200g), and packs somewhat small(8L)  
\-: Maybe too much zippers going on? Questionable quality? A little camping like maybe? Expensive compared to what it is

[Western Mountaineering UltraLight](https://www.westernmountaineering.com/product/ultralite/)¬†Can get it for around $465

\+: Seems like super good Quality. Very light(880g). Can zip up almost in the bottom, so my feet can get some air at least.  
\-: Expensive. Is a bit slim maybe. Doesn't come with compress bag, so have to buy that on the side. I have heard it doesn't compress that well either(9L?).

I have looked at several other brands and models (like Marmot, Feathered Friends, Therm-A-Rest and so on) but these two are probably the best options I have found so far. But none of them seems to be really perfect either. I am not necessarily on a super tight budget, but I think the UltraLight is close to my limit of what I would like to spend. Also i am 187cm (6'1.5"") tall, so I guess I need the long version of all sleeping bags.

I hope some of you might have some good input? Have you tried on of the bags? Do you know of some better? Are they too cold or too warm for what I intend to use them for?",post,r/WildernessBackpacking,Comedy,0.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/WildernessBackpacking/comments/1kscc40/sleeping_bag_advice_needed/
"If the WM UltraLite would be too slim, the AlpinLite is the same bag in a wider cut.  It‚Äôs a wonderful bag, but a bit pricier.

"I had a mountain lion encounter This past week me and a friend were hiking in Yosemite. We got to the top of the 3 mile round trip hike at dark. About 1k ft elevation climb. The sunset was great up on the peak. We then started down the trail back to the car. Only 1.5 miles to go.

About .5 miles down the trail we heard something running in the woods. We looked around and saw some eyes uphill from us looking down at us. Probably 50yds away. We remember the eyes being very close together and big and low to the ground. We talked and shined lights in that direction for 5 mins before heading down further.

Then .1 miles before we get to the car we see 10 yards ahead and uphill of us the same eyes. Low to the ground and big. It was in a bush staring at us. Now we noticed the light colored hair and recognized it as a lion. We yelled at it and after a couple minute stare down it headed uphill and away.

What scares me now is backpacking alone in Yosemite. I have been backpacking alone for years but this encounter leaves me edgy. What if it had just been me and not the two of us? The lion trailed us for about a mile and we never even saw it until the end of the hike. I‚Äôm just really scared to go solo backpacking now even though I have some awesome hikes I want to do.

"I want to just add my two cents.  I‚Äôve had mountain lions on my property where I live for years (not THAT far from Yosemite, as a matter of fact).  Recently PG&E came and removed a lot of trees and revealed that the female mountain lion I always SENSED but had never seen or heard, had a LARGE den that was literally not ten feet from my backyard in some dense blackberry bushes.  She‚Äôs literally coexisted with me for YEARS, and not been seen or heard.  I still FELT her though.  She has come back for years and had cubs on the property.

Finally this last year she came back and found her den DESTROYED and she was PISSED!!!  Get this:  She marched up and down my driveway yowling at the top of her lungs.  I don‚Äôt think she was just calling for a mate, because she appeared to be also aiming her fury at me at the same time.  She did this for days on end!!  Amazingly she was walking within 20 to 30 feet of my front door and I still wasn‚Äôt SEEING HER!!!  She is AMAZING at staying just inches outside the halo of light my porch light casts and she knows how to clear the way when I shine a lantern or flashlight in her direction.  It‚Äôs actually kind of amazing to me, because with her LOUD YELLING me, it wasn‚Äôt even remotely difficult for me to echo-locate her as being directly outside the circle of light on my driveway‚Ä¶

So, anyway, she finally calmed down and hasn‚Äôt been pacing my driveway yelling at me anymore, but I‚Äôm more aware of her presence than ever.  I live alone with a small dog that would present no challenge to her if she wanted to take him out.  I feel kind of surprised to have found this new sense of peace and tentative acceptance from her.  My Dad actually caught her in the flashlight JUST ONCE before, and he felt her stalking him in the bushes.  He never saw her again though.  My brother once saw her cub, but not her, and he backed away carefully.

All this is to say, I am not really concerned even if I remain respectful of her space.  I have no doubt of where she is most of the time, and I know the seasons she is there and when she is away.  I‚Äôve caught other creatures on cameras while I wasn‚Äôt there, like big black bears and bear cubs and all manner of smaller creatures, stay cattle, deer, opossums, raccoons, skunks, gray foxes, etc.  She hasn‚Äôt shown up even ONCE though!!  I‚Äôm not easily made uncomfortable, but I have to admit she surprised me when I realized she had been living close enough to me that she could watch me water the back lawn from barely 15 feet from the edge of where I have often walked around blissfully ignorant to where she slept.

I‚Äôm fairly sure after over a decade or more around her, that she has had MANY opportunities to harm me, yet she hasn‚Äôt decided to.  Sure, she could.  One day something could snap in her head and she could leap on me, but I‚Äôm sure she weighs close to the same weight I do, and I don‚Äôt think I would make a good meal for her.  I would certainly fight back.  If you look at the OFFICIAL records in California then you see that there are actually less than 100 CONFIRMED kills of humans by mountain lions since 1850.  Now, there are almost CERTAINLY more than that, but most of the time people are killed by mountain lions and no part of them turns up afterwards.  I‚Äôm sure that happens.  However, it‚Äôs rare and they call them ghost cats for a reason.  They really aren‚Äôt going to attack a person who weighs nearly their same weight.  Children and slender women are typically the ones that have been confirmed kills.  Sometimes thinner or shorter men.  (I‚Äôm not super tall myself, but I‚Äôm not particularly worried.)

It‚Äôs completely possible I am naive, but I know that at least my own local mountain lion representative is fairly reasonable with me thus far.  She was pissed her den was gone, but she hasn‚Äôt even come into the light to say so.  She just moaned and grumbled from the shadows.  They are certainly NOT an animal to take lightly, but they also are not really LOOKING for a fight with a human.  If you appeared injured or weak, or just unusually incapable of fighting back, I think they might sense that and take the advantage.  That would be a rare day though.  They would have to be pretty desperate.

P.S:  One more little short story‚Ä¶I just wanted to mention the largest male mountain lion caught in 80 years in all the surrounding counties around mine, and counting mine, was caged on my property in the 80s by my grandpa.  The Fish and Game came and sadly had to kill him because he had BENT THEIR CAGE OPENED, and was almost out.  Now THAT was a big mountain lion.  I am very live and let live with these fine beasts, as my whole family has been, but that one was hunting in bright noon daylight and was NOT acting normal.  I would be a lot more afraid of a big cat like that than the female mother I have on my land right now.  You don‚Äôt want a dangerously desperate cougar around.",comment_5,r/WildernessBackpacking,Comedy,,https://www.reddit.com/r/WildernessBackpacking/comments/1kqwuii/i_had_a_mountain_lion_encounter/

Am I crazy for planning a thru hike that late in the season or are the alarmists off base?

I get that it will be cold at high elevations, and I‚Äôm prepared for that. I get that there could be snow, and I will be prepared for that, and fully prepared to know where my bail out points are if a big dump comes thru. Also fewer daylight hrs. Etc.

"It‚Äôs actually a super time to go if you‚Äôre prepared.  I‚Äôve been out many times at that time of year in the Sierra.  Over a 2-3 week period there‚Äôs a good chance for precipitation but probably nothing substantial that might only delay you a day or two.  And otherwise shorter and cooler days but a great chance for mostly sun!  As others have mentioned resupply is more challenging but still possible.

Only once was I caught where being over a day from a trailhead and then a major dump of snow (nearly 3 feet).  That time I bailed out after staying the night in the storm and then got out when the weather cleared up some in the next days; and with today‚Äôs forecasting that kind of size storm I would have knowledge of even in the mountains using my Garmin.

Multi-day storms are rare. And, so, relatively speaking, are other hikers. 

The one issue I didn‚Äôt quite prepare myself mentally for on the JMT was the reduced amount of daylight. I had to overcome my innate resistance to making camp as early as I needed to.

"Struggling to put together a backpacking itinerary in Cascade Pass - Overwhelmed by information I landed upon information for Cascade Pass & Sahale Arm on the WTA site, but I'm at a loss for actually piecing this together as a trip. My friend and I are semi-experienced backpackers and are looking to do a 4 - 5 day trip in mid August. We are prioritizing mountain views & forests; bonus if we can get to old growth forest around Beaver Lake Loop. We would be flying out to Seattle and taking a rental car.

  
I must not be looking in the right place, but I can't find a solid map of all of these trails to see if I could do this trip as a loop (8 - 12 miles per day) OR an out & back.. Does anybody have any suggested itineraries we could follow along with or resources I could use to map this trip out?",post,r/WildernessBackpacking,Comedy,2.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/WildernessBackpacking/comments/1krjwke/struggling_to_put_together_a_backpacking/
"Use Caltopo to plan your routes. You can create routes and view distance/gain as well as a variety of helpful overlays like slope angle, etc. You can also use the USGS topo overlay to see those useful maps. Here's Caltopo centered on Cascade Pass:

[https://caltopo.com/map.html#ll=48.47813,-121.055&z=14&b=mbt](https://caltopo.com/map.html#ll=48.47813,-121.055&z=14&b=mbt)

To answer your Q: No, you can't really connect those two areas in the time you have, and if you had much longer and DID connect them, it would be a LOT of not very exciting valley walking.

Cascade Pass and Sahale Arm are definitely worth seeing, but I don't know of any loops you can do that incorporate it. The popular thing to do is to hike from Cascade Pass into the remote village of Stehekin and hang out there, then head back. Thats about 23 miles from Cascade Pass trailhead to High Bridge, where there's a little shuttle that runs into the settlement.

What you might want to do is just dayhike Cascade Pass and up Sahale Arm (where the best views are), and do a shorter backpack elsewhere.

If you want a classic Cascade backpacking loop, a good one is the Spider Gap/Buck Creek Pass loop in the Glacier Peak Wilderness, which is as good or better than anything in a National Park

"Working remote all summer. Where to base myself from? Hey guys  ‚Äî I‚Äôm in a unique window of life and could use your help picking where to go next and the best trails. 

I‚Äôve been living the remote semi-nomadic life for 2‚Äì3 years now, and my company is calling me back to the office in mid October. So I want to take full advantage of these final 4‚Äì5 months working remotely by living in places with world-class hiking access.

I work Monday through Friday, 7 AM‚Äì4 PM (PST) I live out of Airbnbs, short-term rentals, or tent camp out of my Subaru Outback (could throw a mattress in there but I'm fine dispersed tent camping). If I camp, I work from coffee shops or libraries ‚Äî I just need Wi-Fi or cell service for my hotspot within ~20 minutes of where I sleep. I can spend $2,000/month or less (basically acts as my rent) or go dirtbag-style if needed. I‚Äôm perfectly fine bouncing around every 1‚Äì3 weeks

My goals this summer:
1. Pick a place where I can do after-work hikes (4 PM‚Äì10 PM) a few times per week
2. Do epic weekend backpacking trips. I get off work at 4 so ideally it's within an hour or 2 where I can knock out some miles Friday night. Then hike Saturday and hike back out Sunday night. I can take a couple long weekends if I want. Saving some of those for some week long longer backpacking trips. 
3. Live in beautiful, wild places that are hard to access once I‚Äôm stuck in an office

I've done a lot of places the past couple years. I spent a month in Kalispell area to go to Glacier on the weekends (and some day hikes in the area), in Yosemite foothills city area for the valley in spring (I'm from SoCal so this is my home area) camped around Utah, etc. My favorite has been an Airbnb for a month in Alaska simply because there was so much unbelievable hiking to do and sundown wasn't until 11pm so I could do epic hikes on work nights. I'm tempted to go back there but it seems all the good stuff is hard to pack in a weekend. Have done just weekend stuff in the Tetons, Banff, and some others. 

Places I‚Äôm considering bouncing around every couple weeks 

	1. Eastern Sierra, CA (June/July) ‚Äì Tons of weekend backpacking options that I've done a bit of. Maybe Tahoe is best for after work hikes and mammoth area for backpacking? 

	2. Beartooths ‚Äì place I haven't been. Considering maybe the red lodge area? 

	3, Tetons ‚Äì great camping outside the park. Close enough to hike?  Places to work? 

	4. Canmore/Banff, Canada ‚Äì Explored for a weekend, loved it. But expensive; I‚Äôd camp. Any good Canada recs? 

	5 . Crested Butte or Ouray, CO ‚Äì steep hikes, big views, not sure about post-work trail access or epic backpacking 

6. Back to Alaska 

International (for August/September?): 
	I've never been hiking abroad. But thinking it could work. I would be working 4pm-11pm which would leave weekday mornings/afternoon for hiking 

- Switzerland or French Alps ‚Äì Thinking Chamonix or somewhere. Worried it won't be a wilderness feel but could be cool to do parts of the Tour de Mont Blanc
	‚Ä¢	Norway? Could be a wilderness feel with decent transportation? 
	‚Ä¢	Iceland? No idea where to base out of

"Several suggestions of Bend. I‚Äôm partial because I live here, but the smaller town of Ashland has access to the same Cascades (south of Bend) as well as multiple PCT trail heads, both in Oregon and California, which is 14 miles south. Southern Cascades are 30 minutes in one direction, Siskiyou Mountains 30 minutes in another direction. 

Dry, mild summer weather, tho wildfires can some years spoil the party‚Äîsame as many of these mentioned. 

PCT access, Marble Mountains, Trinity Alps, Russian Wilderness, Kaliompsis Wilderness, Sky High Lakes, within an hour or two, depending on the trail head. Not the high altitudes of the Sierra, most in the 5,000 to 7,000 ft range, which makes the weather more predictable and not as many afternoon thunderstorms.

It‚Äôs a low population region of Oregon and California, so not as crowded as the Sierra, with the exception of the PCT which can be busy.

"Not necessarily in this exact order although Stanley ID, one of the WY choices or Leavenworth area in WA would be my top choices. Even though you can't go wrong with any of these. 

Stanley Idaho. Epiccc sawtooth/white clouds/frank church/the Bitterroots hiking. Yearsssss worth. World class fly fishing. Stunning. Remote. 

Durango Colorado. The San Juan mountains are fucking incredible. Fishingggg. Also close to Utah hiking. 

West Yellowstone area/Gardiner or anywhere near this. Because, Yellowstone is incredible, but more importantly ALL the backpacking directly around it. Lifetimes of backpacking. Yellowstone. Beartooths. Lee Metcalf. Tobacco Roots. On and on and on. World class fishing. Beautiful scenery. 

Jackson WY of course. It's not just Teton NP. You got legendary backpacking alllllll around it. The Teton Wilderness area is massive. The Gros Ventre Wilderness. The wind river range. Topppp tier shit everywhere. Fishingggg haha. 

Leavenworth WA. Same theme man. Just endlessssss amounts of epic hiking. North Cascades. Alpine Lakes wilderness. Pasayten Wilderness. Mt. Baker. Mt. Rainer. Goat Rocks. Olympics not even far. Arguably this location would give you the most access to insane amounts of variety. That said, lot more people. Fishing is good but not as world class as the others. Significant more access to bigger towns/cities. WAs backpacking is fucking incredible. North Cascades alone...called the American Alps for a reason. 

Bend OR would be solid. Although personally I don't think the hiking is as epic as all the above. 

Joseph OR if you want to crush the Eagle Cap wilderness which is great. Also reasonably easy to access good chunks of ID within reasonable drive.

"Climbing to Patterson Peak - in the White Clouds Wilderness directly across the highway from the Sawtooths gives you A+ views of the entire Sawtooth Range from a slightly close distance since they're across the highway from each other. Also, you'd be looking down a sweet bed of lakes. This hike isn't even that far and is a natural scramble from 4th of July Creek TH. If you were ambitious, you could continue the ridge walks north or east; albeit much more harrowing at that point. 

Parks Peak and Imogene peak would provide wonderful view.   
Snowyside, Perfect Peak and El Capitan are all on a ridge walk and not all that crazy.   
 

There aren't a lot of high country ridgeline style trails in here due to the nature of the peaks and the ridges themselves. They're often very jagged making traversing ridgelines more of a peak bagging scramble effort. 

The Sawtooths are not Yellowstone/the Greater Tetons/Portions of MT in the sense where there's large open ridgelines you can walk with sweeping views everywhere. The Sawtooths sweeping views come mostly in the way of climbing straight up the jagged ridge itself/towards a peak.",comment_4,r/WildernessBackpacking,Comedy,,https://www.reddit.com/r/WildernessBackpacking/comments/1kriz96/sawtooth_recs/

"New Forest Service Chief Tom Schultz wrote a white paper a few years ago about his ideas on National Forests.  He did not call for selling the lands or massive resource extraction.  Instead, he called for a different approach of remaining in federal ownership, but with administration by the states within the guidelines set by the feds.  He claimed the states did a better job managing their own state forests than the feds did managing the National Forests, with some states actually showing a profit.  There are some holes in his claim, notably most state forests are very high quality timberland, with the National Forests having lower quality timberland and a lot of non-productive land (many National Forests were created from the leftover public lands that private timber companies did not want), and the Forest Service is obligated by law to provide for wilderness, wildlife, recreation, and other low-revenue non-commodity products.  Most state forests are managed to maximize timber production with any other use de-emphasized or given token lip service.        

His model is not too different from the campaign position statements of Al Gore in 2000 and John Kerry in 2004, that also called for greater state involvement in federal land management.",comment_1,r/WildernessBackpacking,Comedy,,https://www.reddit.com/r/WildernessBackpacking/comments/1kr4ehg/today_may_20_1pm_ama_on_protecting_public_lands/

"first time solo trip adivce hi backpacking,

I'm a pretty regular hiker and solo camper, but I haven't had any experience backpacking yet. It's something id love to try and I recently was given some gear so I'm looking to try to do an over night in the Catskills memorial day weekend, but none of my friends have the gear to join me. 

Is trying my first night solo a bad idea? I'm very familiar with the area and have camped at proper camp grounds solo before. I'm hoping that there may be a busy weekend and I'll be able to meet up with other campers. 

Looking for any advice or thoughts! Here's my gear list so far, would love any advice to fill in what I'm missing:

-Pack

-tent

-sleeping bag

-foam pad

-headlamp  

-stove & propane (need to get)

-bear bag? (need to get)

-first aid and toiletries kit",post,r/WildernessBackpacking,Comedy,4.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/WildernessBackpacking/comments/1kra0y1/first_time_solo_trip_adivce/
"REI has a really great gear checklist that I use.¬†


For your list, main thing I see missing is water. Do you have a water filtration system?¬†


I'd also take a good inventory of your clothing, so a rain jacket and layers like fleece/down jacket.¬†


Another would be some sort of power bank for your phone or GPS.¬†",comment_1,r/WildernessBackpacking,Comedy,,https://www.reddit.com/r/WildernessBackpacking/comments/1kra0y1/first_time_solo_trip_adivce/
"Go enjoy the trip!

If you are backpacking on a regular maintained trail, you probably won't be alone.  There will be other hikers on the same trail.  In case of mishap someone will be along shortly.  Realistically, what are the chances of a mishap?  Have you had an accident requiring assistance when with a group?  The odds of needing assistance are about the same when solo.   

After you get comfortable solo backpacking on a popular trail, choose a lesser used trail or the off-season.  More solitude. Eventually you may want to start solo off-trail.  Then it becomes both exhilarating and sobering.  The solitude and personal accomplishment are magnificient, but in case of mishap you are on your own.  Almost no chance someone else will come along and even under the best circumstances SAR will be days away.        

Upsides of solo hiking:  You set your own pace, stop and break when you want, set up camp where you want.  Change routes as you want.  Don't have to listen to snoring or farting all night.  

Downsides:  You carry all the gear, cannot distribute the load.  You do all the camp chores.  No one to motivate you when you dawdle.  No one to talk to or discuss a change in plans.  Can be lonely in the evening.",comment_2,r/WildernessBackpacking,Comedy,,https://www.reddit.com/r/WildernessBackpacking/comments/1kra0y1/first_time_solo_trip_adivce/
"A life straw works, water filtration tabs work, sawyer squeeze works. Test it out before you get out into the backcountry so that you know if you like how it works or tastes.  Make sure you know if there's agricultural runoff, a lot of dirt in the water, or giardia where you're going- that changes what you need your filter to do.",comment_3,r/WildernessBackpacking,Comedy,,https://www.reddit.com/r/WildernessBackpacking/comments/1kra0y1/first_time_solo_trip_adivce/
"Obviously you need water bottles and a water sanitation arrangement.  I prefer Sawyer filters, but there are other filters out there.  Or you can use iodide tablets for a short trip.  Good to bring a few in case your filter fails, but they hurt the taste of the water for me.  I don't think you need a toiletries kit.  A plastic toothbrush doesn't weigh much.  Get a travel-size tube of toothpaste and a half-used bar of soap and you're all set.  If it's just one night, you could skip the soap really.  A little hand sanitizer could be an alternative.  Remember a bit of toilet paper, and be sure to bury it along with whatever comes out.  You could bring a little plastic trowel, but I just use an appropriately shaped rock to dig a hole so that the top of what you bury is at least a foot underground after you fill it back up with the dirt you dug out.  In the Catskills you will need a way to protect your stuff (including toiletries) from bears. Either a bear bag or a canister.  The canister is heavier but more fool proof.

You could skip the stove and fuel, especially for just one overnight.  Just bring food that doesn't need cooking.  Unless, like me, you need coffee.  Then the stove and fuel are essential.

"I do a lot of commercial freeze dried meals, and switched from a pot to a tea kettle (GSI Halulite) because of it. It's so much easier to pour from a kettle than a pot! So, so, sooo much easier. And I also wanted to branch out to cooking more meals, so I added two more pot things that all stack together:

Inside the kettle I keep my stove (Pocket Rocket 2), 3.9 oz fuel can, fuel can stand, 2 folding spoons, lighter and piezo, a handkerchief for drying/wiping/whatever, and some tea/cider packets. I then nest the kettle into a Sea to Summit collapsible bowl/plate/thing, which then gets nested inside an aluminum Teflon pot/skillet thing from some long lost brand. 

It's a very neat and tidy, and super flexible, package. If I don't need the collapsible bowl and pot/skillet, I use them to hold garbage and small things while I'm cooking, so it all stays together and off the ground. One of my spoons is long and kinda flimsy and the other is shorter and much stronger, each one is used for different tasks and meals.

All together, with a full can of fuel, it weighs 2 pounds. I know I could cut weight if I'm not planning to use a bowl or pot, but there's peace of mind keeping it all together and knowing I have the same gear every time.

Truth 1: temperature drops with elevation.  For each 1000‚Äô of elevation, temperature can change as much as 5*F.  Conclusion: to be warmer, go lower.

Truth 2: cold air sinks and collects at lower elevations.  Conclusion: don‚Äôt sleep in valleys?

"Eja 58L or 48L Hello!

I live in Australia, and I am looking at getting either the Eja 58L or the 48L in the dark teal colour (this is important). 

I currently use a Gregory Jade 38 and have made it work for 3-day thru-hiking/camping trips. I really like this backpack, but it is noticeably tight to pack. I recently got a 2-p tent to accommodate my husband, and that kind of killed the 38 for me. I made it work, but it was awful.  

My gut instinct was to get the 58 as the grammage was not that much different, but the teal colour is not available in Australia. I would have to order it from REI and have it forwarded to Aus for an additional 50 AUD on top of it being already more expensive. Yes, I despise that purple colour that much. I am still leaning this way, but am also considering the 48L too. 

The 48L in teal is readily available nearby.

"Camera recs? Just popping in here to ask: what camera are y‚Äôall using for backpacking trips? 

Some background- I do basic landscape photography as a hobby. Nothing too crazy but I want a camera that goes beyond my iphone 11 for capturing my trips. I previously used a Canon G7X ii for some trips and I absolutely loved all its capabilities, and got some great shots with it, but it fell short on durability. I sadly wrecked it after my last trip to the Rockies‚Ä¶so now I‚Äôm on the hunt for a replacement. 

So with that said: anyone here into photography & videography that can recommend a good but durable camera setup for treks? I‚Äôm looking for something relatively light (though obviously I understand weight is a sacrifice when it comes to camera equipment) that can take nice pics, to include low light photos. I do already own a GoPro and a Canon DSLR but neither really seem to hit that ‚Äúsweet spot‚Äù for what I‚Äôm looking for- basically high quality with flexible settings but also portable. The GoPro is cool for some stuff but quality is a bit meh for photos, and the DSLR is just way too heavy to be practical. Ofc I‚Äôm always looking for something budget friendly but I‚Äôm open to buying something nice if it‚Äôs going to last a long time.

TIA for your advice!",post,r/WildernessBackpacking,Comedy,0.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/WildernessBackpacking/comments/1kq7qqz/camera_recs/
"Sony RX100 VII.  Much better lens and sensor than a cell phone, and has all of the settings options someone serious about photography will care about, without the size and bulk of a camera with interchangeable lenses.

The Sony Alpha series are a good choice if you do want interchangeable lenses and even better sensors, and are willing to deal with some bulk and weight.  The RX100 is pocketable though.

"First time backpacking, seeking recommendations for Ozark trail vs Isle Royale Hello all,

I'm planning a camping/backpacking trip in a couple weeks (June 1-11) and am trying to decide between the Ozark trail and Isle Royale (I'm based in Chicago so they're sorta equidistant). I would only be backpacking for a couple days, and car camping the rest of the trip. I have a good amount of experience camping, and want to get into backpacking. I already have a proper backpack for it, and a good amount of gear for regular camping. I have a limited budget for new gear but will almost certainly have to get a stove and water filtration system.

I'm looking for people who have been to one or both of these places and could share experiences and/or recommendations especially to a first-time backpacker.",post,r/WildernessBackpacking,Comedy,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/WildernessBackpacking/comments/1kppi6e/first_time_backpacking_seeking_recommendations/

Isle royale is very rugged hiking at times, ive been to glacier and grand canyon multiple times and can say even without the elevation the Isle is rugged and demanding.  Early June will be less bugs but I generally don't go that far north until late August as a native michigander. The black flies and mosquitoes are a real thing in early summer there. The Isle is an awesome experience for its remotness and isolation and always a worthy trip. There's a reason it's one of the least visited and most revisited national parks. Ive been backcountry in alot of places and I'll always go back to the island any chance I get, its truly a unique experience that I really enjoy. No bears, no ticks, no poison ivy.

Great camps too where the trail drops down into the middle fork, by the hot springs and then again by Little Bear Canyon where you pop out if going clockwise. Did it in 3 days, 2 nights.

If you are going to an area that allows off-lead dogs, make sure your recall is as strong as it can be.

"Grayson Highlands / Mt Rogers Loop VA Camping Spots Question planning a 3 day backpacking trip with a large group for the Grayson highlands / Mt rogers group. I‚Äôm very new to this, and so are many of my friends. 

i was wondering if there are any good places to set up camp further down the trail past Thomas Knob shelter in order to shorten how long our day 2 would be? or alternatively what changes we could make to day 2 route to cut it down. i‚Äôm basing the trip off of the link. again, very new to this, so any other unrelated advice is welcome as well. thank you so much!!!",post,r/WildernessBackpacking,Comedy,0.0,https://www.sintax77.com/hiking-the-grayson-highlands-solo-backpacking-trip/
"If I remember right, that's actually in the GH state Park, and you'll have to pay for it. If you park at Elk Garden, it's free and less crowded. Also, it's a beautiful walk-in from there and will give you and your friends a taste of what they place offers. 

That being said, I'd recommend going clockwise from there. Make it to the camp somewhere around the backside of Mt Rodgers in the wilderness area before starting your first big elevation climb. You should come across plenty of campsites. The next day, work your way over to the Scales area. Or up the ridge just past that. The views of Mt Rodgers from that area are amazing. You should get there early and explore the highlands over there after setting up camp. Next day, you'll work your way over to Massy Gap and start your way up Wildburn Ridge. Take your time going around there. It's pretty awesome. If I remember, we only had like a 6-7 mile day from our camp up past the ridge by Scales. If the Wind is manageable, there is a spot in the open area just past Wilburn (straight south down the Mt from Thomas Knob)  that we managed to get and was easily the best campsites views we came across in the whole park. If I remember, it was one of like 3 sites  closest to the water source. If the wind is harsh, go to Thomas Knob or one of the other sites in the tree line. Your last day will only be 4 miles out back to Elk Garden (that's including the Mt Rodgers summit). Leave your packs at the base of Rodgers before working your way up as you'll be back down in 30 minutes, and the extra weight on day 3 would just suck. 

Going this direction will allow your experience to only get better the farther along you go. The backside of the Rodgers is wooded and along bridle trails. It's not nearly as exciting so I would recommend doing the bulk of the hiking one your first day and save the best for a shorter day 2 and 3

Side note: I don't know where your groups physical limits are but if you can manage, we actually left our backpacks in the car at ELK Garden (got there around 9am) grabbed our day bags and hiked the opposite direction up the AT to Buzzard Rock to start our trip. It was pretty awesome up there as well. Worked our way back to the car, switched our bags, and hiked another mile to camp right before the loop. Made it to Scales Ridge for camp #2 and saved the same recommended route for night #3. 

If all of that is a little confusing, I'd be happy to put together our route with waypoints of the campsites via Alltrails and share it with you. I also have pictures Day by Day, including that last campsite up on my IG that you can use as a reference 

I'm the trip planner for my group. I usually give them all the important information but save the good stuff (campsites / POI along trail) to myself going in. Though I know what to expect from the views, there is something about seeing my friends' raw genuine reaction of amazement when we get to the good stuff. It also keeps the risk + reward balance in check and will be a sure-fire way to make sure your party has a memorable experience and keep a drive to go along on more trips in the future, and pushing yourselves in the best way",comment_1,r/WildernessBackpacking,Comedy,,https://www.sintax77.com/hiking-the-grayson-highlands-solo-backpacking-trip/

Step 1 - move out of Texas,comment_1,r/WildernessBackpacking,Comedy,,https://www.reddit.com/r/WildernessBackpacking/comments/1kojdh5/new_to_hikingcamping/
"So many variables!

In the end your setup can only be worked out by doing it and finding out what works for you and what you need. You might get out there with all this gear and decide you don't need most of it. You might get out there and have it be desperately miserable because you are missing one crucial thing. 

There is a baseline - and there are stacks of articles about what you must have - but even that can be variable depending on where you go and how long for. 

But very generally speaking, I would say you need:

\- a sleep system that is going to keep you warm and comfortable (usually involving some kind of mat/pad for insulation and some kind of thing to wrap around you like a sleeping bag or a quilt).

\- a shelter system that is going to keep rain/condensation off you

\- a way to safely store and/or cook food

\- a way to treat water if needed 

\- navigation equipment

\- first aid/emergency equipment 

\- a bag to carry it all in

\- dry clothing/extra layers for being able to change into for around camp/sleep (especially if your day clothes get wet). 

Within all of that is where the variables are.  Plus there's plenty of added extras for personal comfort/needs.

There are a LOT of people out there who will tell you that you either need more things than that, or that you must get the latest xyz because it weighs 163g less or whatever. Don't get sucked in if you can help it. When you are starting out, borrow, rent, look at second hand gear, find the cheapest stuff to buy - after all, if you are just getting into it, you might not like it anyway. I'd also recommend, even if solo stuff is the goal (and I'm right there with you... at least I am in spirit, hopefully located at least a few kilometres away) going on some trips with other people first. Seeing other people's setups in action and what they bring and take and how they go with it all, including food, is a great way to start to get an understanding of what is really necessary and what you might like.

For solo specific stuff, it depends a little bit on what kind of walking you are considering doing. If you are going off track at all, you have to make sure your nav skills are good to go. Can you find your way if your phone drops dead at the worst moment? How's your first aid knowledge? Do you know the best safety advice for your particular area you're going to be in, what to watch out for, how the terrain normally works, etc etc. If you are largely sticking to established tracks and things, the above can still be useful anyway, but there are still some other solo considerations - like, how do you deal with boredom? How are you going to keep yourself occupied if you smash it through to camp and have hours of daylight and early evening and there's no-one around to talk to - will you need that? do you know?

  
LIke I said at the beginning though, a lot of this stuff can't be found out before you've actually started to do it. That's part of the fun - be prepared to be uncomfortable, discover just how strong your coffee dependency is, realise that that amazing $500 bag everyone raves about has an arch nemesis plant barb that CAN rip holes in it despite all the techno-babble about the material and it exists exactly where you live, find out how much food you really do need, learn good tent placement etc etc etc. Mostly, the worst thing you are going to have happen is an uncomfortable night or two and some experience that you can stock away for future.",comment_2,r/WildernessBackpacking,Comedy,,https://www.reddit.com/r/WildernessBackpacking/comments/1kojdh5/new_to_hikingcamping/
"When starting you can buy the basics and use some stuff from home.

For example you'll want a tent, which you can get for a reasonable price from Walmart, with their Ozark Trails line. But during the warmer part of the year you can use a couple of blankets from home instead of a sleeping bag. 

When starting out you can go really basic on the food - bring sub sandwiches in a cooler, or cook hot dogs over the fire.

You will appreciate having somewhere besides the picnic table to sit, so folding camping chairs would be nice.

As far as places to camp, you'll want to look for State Parks or National Forests around you. Both of them have campgrounds, plus National Forests have dispersed roadside camping and backcountry (backpacking) camping, both of which are free.",comment_3,r/WildernessBackpacking,Comedy,,https://www.reddit.com/r/WildernessBackpacking/comments/1kojdh5/new_to_hikingcamping/

"dream two week trip - seeking routes Hey folks!  
  
I'm a university student who has gone onto summer break. With my summer job schedule, myself and a few friends can set aside two weeks (ish) for a destination wilderness backpacking trip, beginning or mid august.

I've honestly been struggling to pick a destination! We live in Toronto, and I'm a little tired of the northern scenery. 

We're all reasonably fit and reasonably experienced with backpacking, and have been considering destinations/routes like: 

* Lake Tahoe Rim Loop
* John Muir Trail 
* Yosemite High Route

But all of these seem to have some pitfalls, like John Muir needing permits 24 weeks in advance (and needing longer than two weeks) and more permit issues with the YHR, and the Tahoe Rim loop having repetitive terrain. 

Despite this, I'm leaning towards the YHR - permits seem slightly easier to navigate than John Muir, and I love the terrain. Resupply seems a mild challenge, but again, navigable.

I would love to hear suggestions of similar hikes with similar timeframes. Ideally, trips would max out at 14 days, since either end needs reasonable logistics flight and accommodation wise. Would not shun suggestions for routes outside North America, but would prefer a North American route for logistics.

Much appreciated!",post,r/WildernessBackpacking,Comedy,2.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/WildernessBackpacking/comments/1kogoes/dream_two_week_trip_seeking_routes/
"On trail, it's hard to beat the John Muir Trail.  If you don't think you can do it in two weeks (which is tough) and need to cut some off - cut off the northern miles.

Off Trail the Yosemite High Route is probably excellent (I've not done it).

The Sierra High Route is awesome if you are good with off trail travel.

Other (slightly shorter) options are

The Southern Sierra High Route - Ivve done it - it was awesome

The Wind River High Route - Done it twice (both directions) - awesome. 



When I did my two week ""dream trip"" in 2017 it was a fly in trip in Wrangell St. Elias NP - bush plane in/out, no trail, lots of brush, tussocks, an 8 mile day on a glacier, etc.  It was awesome, but expensive and took nearly a year to plan.",comment_1,r/WildernessBackpacking,Comedy,,https://www.reddit.com/r/WildernessBackpacking/comments/1kogoes/dream_two_week_trip_seeking_routes/

"Wind River Trip Advice in Early September Hey everyone! I'm looking to spend a week out in Wyoming in early September this year and I'd like to hit up the Wind River range for a \~4 day backpacking trip. 

  
For context, I'm a fairly avid backpacker in the PNW, but I've never hit elevations like the Wind River. I plan on spending the first few days up at a higher elevation before hitting the trail to help.

  
My biggest questions are:

1. Elevation acclimation. I live at sea level and have about two days to acclimate before I'd like to hit the trail. I plan on ""hiking high, sleeping low"" by doing some day hikes in the area before starting the trip. Any other advice?
2. Crowds. I've heard Wind River can be busy at times, but the further you get back the less you see. Is that still accurate? 
3. Weather. The advice I received was early September is the best time to avoid bugs, but weather can be erratic with rainstorms and maybe snow. Anyone hit anything similar?
4. General route guidance. I'm going off websites like AllTrails on OnX for advice. Any advice from locals or people who have done this before would be great!

  
**Day 1:**

Big Sandy to Pyramid Lake. \~12 miles and \~2k elevation gain.

**Day 2:**

Pyramid Lake to Washakie Lake via Grave Lake. \~12 miles and \~2k elevation gain.

**Day 3:**

Washakie to Lonesome Lake. \~13 miles, \~2k elevation gain.

**Day 4:**

Lonesome back to Big Sandy. \~9 miles, \~2k elevation loss.

Have a solid tent system. T-storm and high winds are possible. Bugs still around depending on location in early September. Acclimation isn‚Äôt a big deal in the Winds.

"I'll be there about a week or two after you! 

For elevation, I just spend a night camping at Sandy campground or in Pinedale depending on where I'm starting my route from. As long as I have a full day and night at a decent elevation beforehand I never have issues. If you *do* start to feel issues on the trail, get down to lower elevation asap. But I wouldn't sweat it.

For crowds, Winds are a mess these days, but it does get better the later in the season. Unfortunately, early September is widely known as the best time to go, so more and more people are going later in the season. It will be better than summer, but you certainly won't be isolated by any means. But it won't be that bad that you won't have a great time. But that's exactly why I go the last week of September. Last year I went the first week of October but late Sept and early Oct are very hit or miss. I just happen to live within 3.5hrs driving and can be flexible, if I had to plan ahead I would pick the first week or two like you did.

"Seeking tent recommendations for 6-week trip Hi folks, I‚Äôm headed to Mongolia mid June for a 6-week long backpacking study abroad trip - and I would love some tent recommendations! The guideline‚Äôs I‚Äôve been given are: the tent must be durable, waterproof, windproof, and 2-person (to fit gear.)

It's between 3-4 lbs which is a fair amount heavier than my Big Agnes or Durston but I was specifically looking for something more waterproof for certain trips with a durable enough floor to not need a footprint and with strong poles.  This looks to fit the bill.  Reviews do say it's ""missing"" two stakes if you want to stake it well.

Overall the extra weight compared to an ultralight is used wisely it seems - but you can apparently replace the the guyline cords with something much lighter weight if you want to bother shaving a few Ozs.

"Buggy is very likely.  Tread carefully.  The mosquitoes in there can be pretty bad.

Hells Canyon might be a safer bet.

I am foolish enough to backpack in June and July.  Long sleeves, headnet, gloves, repellent and I take a thermacell type device (mine is actually from nitecore and runs off my power bank and is lighter).  Make sure you get repellent on places like the backs of your legs.  And they will bite you through a single layer of fabric.  Also, avoid camping near water or tall grass.  A nice open, dry scree field is your friend.  They are also pretty bad fliers so any breeze will keep them down.

I was coming out of Jefferson Wilderness in early July two years ago and they were pretty bad.  I was wearing shorts.  And I missed the backs of my calves.  I was making pretty good time.

I do also have a ‚Äòheatit‚Äô, which is a little thermal device that runs off your phone.  This is super light and will stop the itching. My partner reacts pretty bad (and they love her).  She also swears by Afterbite.

Check out a USGS flow gauge on the main Kern above the dam. This will give you a ballpark idea of what the little Kern is like.
