"Everything revealed in Hollywood since Tropic Thunder has really showed that Grossman wasn’t an exaggeration, is barely a parody, is just pointedly portraying how these foul men act.

Reading about how producers like Scott Rudin abused their way through meetings sounds just like Les; not to get started on all the sexual predators

I would find it difficult to fine the character funny in a post workplace harassment exposed culture, post Me Too.

"While I love the character IDK if he could work as a whole movie.

This guy is a caricature, a parody, an archetype. This sort of character does not benefit from an arc, they do best when held up as a funhouse mirror to the ""sane"" world, which is why he was so hilarious in Tropic Thunder.

At best they should do another movie with Les Grossman as a recurring side character.",comment_4,r/entertainment,Entertainment,,https://variety.com/2025/film/news/christopher-mcquarrie-tom-cruise-les-grossman-movie-1236410254/

Patti LuPone Says Audra McDonald Is 'Not a Friend' Anymore After Backstage Controversy,post,r/entertainment,Entertainment,489.0,https://people.com/patti-lupone-audra-mcdonald-not-friend-anymore-11741765
"I was at one of the preview nights of The Roommate and what’s crazy is that Hell’s Kitchen absolutely was way too loud. Proven by the fact that they adjusted their volume and/or sound insulation very soon after. What wasn’t necessary was Kecia making it about race. It all derailed after that. 

Painting someone as a racist just because you don’t like what they said is becoming wayyyyy too common these days.",comment_1,r/entertainment,Entertainment,,https://people.com/patti-lupone-audra-mcdonald-not-friend-anymore-11741765
"Ok so Patti complained that Alicia Keys musical is too loud and was disrupting her performances, to which Kecia Lewis said was racially motivated. Audra McDonald replied with emojis supporting Lewis so Patti hates them both now? From what I’ve read they adjusted their volume, Patti sent flowers to thank them but still made jokes about them being too loud. and then Kecia posted this.

Seems like much ado about sound insulation, interested to know if there’s more tea on Miss Patti that would back the racism assertion.",comment_2,r/entertainment,Entertainment,,https://people.com/patti-lupone-audra-mcdonald-not-friend-anymore-11741765
"“ LuPone didn’t hold back when asked about Lewis' post. ""She calls herself a veteran? Let’s find out how many Broadway shows Kecia Lewis has done, because she doesn’t know what the f--- she’s talking about,"" she said. ""She’s done seven. I’ve done 31. Don’t call yourself a vet, bitch!""
As Schulman pointed out, Lewis — who was in the original Broadway company of Dreamgirls — actually had 10 Broadway credits, and LuPone, 28. But when told that McDonald had responded to the video with supportive emojis, LuPone’s reaction was equally pointed.

""Exactly,"" she said. ""And I thought, 'You should know better.' That’s typical of Audra.""

"""The Broad City alum went on to explain that Cher’s manager advised the team to write in the Grammy-winning singer’s ice cream brand Cherlato (a portmanteau of Cher and gelato) into the show, and as a result, the musician would “probably” agree to the role.

“So we wrote a commercial for Cherlato,” Downs explained to audience laughs. “Deborah [Smart] was gonna go to the Cherlato factory, she was gonna taste all the Cherlato, she was gonna love the Cherlato, and then when it came down to shoot, we got a pass.”

He continued, “Now, people usually say, ‘I love the show, but respectfully, I don’t have time.’ Once, Javier Bardem said, ‘I cannot say yes right now,’ which is Spanish for ‘no.’ And so we said, ‘Is there any feedback? Can we change the script?’ And her manager said, ‘Well, this is the quote from Cher: I don’t want to do it.'”

> “You just never know what the future holds,” he said. “I don’t want to be in the way of someone else or I don’t want to be the stale old man riding the same thing. That doesn’t really happen that much at ‘SNL’ but there’s no guarantees, I guess.”",comment_4,r/entertainment,Entertainment,,https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/kenan-thompson-change-snl-season-51-1236409874/

"Jon Stewart has been utterly disappointing tbh. It’s like he’s scared to call what’s happening before our very eyes for what it is. In fact, most media and left leaning politicians have all been pretty quiet and reserved in how they are tackling a coup, the attack on all our freedoms, and transparent corruption. Seems most people that have money are willing to ride it out and hope it’s not as bad as it seems, or risk their media parent companies to shut down their money. Jon should’ve made a podcast and gotten his real opinions on trump heard, but for now it seems he’s content with being muzzled by paramount. In the end, he has the money to not worry, so why risk it for the common man",comment_2,r/entertainment,Entertainment,,https://www.thewrap.com/jon-stewart-says-price-of-peace-is-different-under-second-trump-administration-all-must-pay-tribute-video/

"> How did everyone involved in making this movie see this nonsensical weapon of a central character and agree that it makes sense??

It is a fantasy movie, and it is a poster depicting a scene that is not even in the movie. Among the sea of bullshit bollywood peddles, are you trying to pick pointless holes in the one reasonable **fantasy** movie made in the last 20 years?

The scene where he props up a 50,000 metric ton statue all by himself is also not realistic btw. Nor is his catapult transport system.",comment_1,r/BollywoodRealism,Entertainment,,https://i.redd.it/pmwaaj4jq3te1.png

"1) this is not Bollywood 
2) movies take a bit of “cinematic liberty” when it comes to action sequences. Its only crass if its over done. 

For eg in Hollywood superhero movies, neglecting the power of the superhero itself(which is assumed as its superhero fiction) , do you think everything else follows the rules of physics. For eg iron man falling from a great height would be killed instantly , doesn’t matter how strong the suit is . Stopping a body in high velocity motion will kill anyone. So no, unless rules of gravity or momentum work differently in superhero movies

Superman diving and scooping his gf at the last minute of the fall will cut her into three pieces not save her. So Hollywood takes a lot of cinematic liberties as well",comment_4,r/BollywoodRealism,Entertainment,,https://v.redd.it/flw72hnd2fle1

"My current favourite TV series In no particular order (and no spoilers, let's not ruin the experience for anyone)

1. Better Call Saul: Insane character depth, incredible cinematography, believable storyline, amazing storytelling, perfect score, so so much more. However, the main reason we watch the show is for Saul Goodman. Probably the best portrayal of a character since Heath Ledger's joker.  Yes, it's a slow burn, but worth it.
2. The Bear: Chaotic, authentic, beautiful. A must watch for anyone who loves enjoying every aspect of life. Probably not the best way to describe this series, but that's how it makes me feel.
3. YellowJackets: Incredible storytelling so far, literally has 2 (sometimes 3) timelines running concurrently. Granted, some moments are cheesy, and reminds you of the IT storyline, however it's still a notable addition to this list.
4. A notable addition: Snowfall. Snowfall is slowly growing on me. It's a seemingly generic series, with poor storytelling, however the main character Franklin is quite likeable.",post,r/TVSeriesSubreddits,Entertainment,8.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/TVSeriesSubreddits/comments/1d0mswe/my_current_favourite_tv_series/

"Can't remember a title and my brain hurts, help me pls A few years ago I've watched a mini-series about siblings from a very wealthy family, the guy had some rare genetic disease and he had been kidnapped by terrorists or something like that and his sister was trying to rescue him by working with government agencies and some local fellas, I can't remember precisely but the plot was something like that.

Having never been there, it was awesome getting a sense of how imposing some of those federal buildings are, and they provided EXCELLENT set pieces for some of the missions. Would have been cool to get more of the city in a DLC instead of going back to New York... again. But hey. New York is New York, so it's still gonna be sweet.

Square Enix settles lawsuit over stolen Front Mission assets,post,r/Games,Entertainment,141.0,https://automaton-media.com/en/news/square-enix-settles-lawsuit-over-stolen-front-mission-assets/
"So for those who haven't heard about this, SE commissioned a chinese dev to make a Front Mission gacha. Over the course of development SE basically ignored their requests for everything, stuff like making the devs have to go hunt down art books themselves in stores on a business trip to japan because SE refused to supply art assets and references themselves, along with a bunch of other classic SE nonsense like telling them not to have the game set in urban environments because it may upset people (which is where most of Front Mission takes place). Eventually the developer got fed up, ties were cut, and the devs decided to continue on with what they made already under a new name.

There was pretty clear cut albeit minor copyright infringement going on, but at the same time based off everything known about the situation I have no sympathy for SE, considering they clearly wanted to do yet another 0 effort gacha cash in with an existing mistreated IP that's meant to end of service after 6-12 months.",comment_1,r/Games,Entertainment,,https://automaton-media.com/en/news/square-enix-settles-lawsuit-over-stolen-front-mission-assets/

# [The Division 2: Crossroads](https://i.imgur.com/qphLVtT.png)

Crossroads gives Agents the opportunity to uncover the truth behind Sokolova's plans, as The Division finds themselves in a race against time and the Black Tusk.

Now that Bardon Schaefer has recovered from his coma, the Division learns of a deep-cover asset embedded within the Sokolov Concern. This logistics manager was meant to be extracted after the events of Coney Island - but time is running out. If Sokolova uncovers his true loyalty, she won't hesitate to eliminate him.

Grab a mug of Kerman's finest and let's break down everything new in Crossroads.

While Crossroads is at the heart of this update, the biggest addition is the launch of our new DLC - Battle for Brooklyn. Set in post-pandemic New York during fall, this campaign takes agents to the streets of Brooklyn Heights and Dumbo to face the growing threat of the Purple Flame.

Featuring new enemies, unlockable skills (including the return of Smart Cover), and the exclusive Catalyst Exotic Mask, Battle for Brooklyn lays the foundation for what's next in The Division 2.

The DLC officially launches on May 27, with access granted after maintenance concludes, and will cost $14.99.

**Global Modifier**

This season's Global Modifier is **""Hard-Core"",** bringing new build-focused bonuses for yourself and your allies that grow based on your Gear Cores, and increase even further upon defeating enemies marked with Hostile Countermeasures.

You will gain three Attribute Scores: Firearms, Stamina and Electronics, each bonus scaling with the current Attribute Tier.

**Firearms**

* Grants **+\[X\]%** Critical Hit Chance (CHC) that bypasses the CHC cap.
* Tier 5 Effect: Instantly refills all ammo, including Signature Weapon ammo.

**Stamina**

* Applies **+\[Y\]%** Bonus Armor every 300K damage you take.
   * Note: Shields require 1.2M damage instead of 300k for the modifier's effects to apply.
* Tier 5 Effect: Instantly refills all Armor Kits.

**Electronics**

* Every time a skill is used, the cooldown of your other skill is reduced by **\[Z\]%** of its current value. (Note: Shields are excluded.)

**Tier Progression and Effects Based on Score:**

|SCORE|TIER|FIREARMS \[X\]|STAMINA \[Y\]|ELECTRONICS \[Z\]|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
||||||
|0 - 249|Tier 1|2|1|7.5|
|250 - 499|Tier 2|4|1.5|11.25|
|500 - 749|Tier 3|5|2|13.75|
|750 - 999|Tier 4|6|2.5|16.25|
|1000|Tier 5|10|3.5|22.5|
|Tier 5 Extra Effect|Complete Ammo Refill (including Signature)|Armor Kits Refilled|Both Cooldowns Reset.||

**Attribute Scores** are influenced by your gear and combat actions:

* Each **Gear Core** adds to your baseline score.
* Killing marked enemies grants bonus points.

 

**Active Modifiers**

This season introduces five Active Modifiers, designed to consume your current score bonus in exchange for a powerful temporary boost. While they work best when coordinated with a team, solo players will also benefit significantly from their effects.

Additionally, Passive Modifier values are doubled for the full duration of any Active Modifier.

 

* **Broken Link** \- on activation, **freeze all attributes** at their current score and **double the values** of each current bonus offered by the attributes' respective tiers, for a limited duration.
* **Target-Rich Environment** \- on activation,3 unmarked targets within **35m** will each be marked with a different mark. For the next **15s**, your kills and assists will yield a **x2** attribute score multiplier.

# [MANHUNT SCOUTS](https://i.imgur.com/Yor8Bq5.png)

In Crossroads, new Manhunt Scouts will continue to be released weekly - but there's no longer a requirement to complete them in a fixed order once they're available.

This season, only the two Scout missions designated as High-Value Targets are required to unlock access to the Climax Mission. These missions are critical for gathering intel and progressing through the Manhunt. The rest can be completed in any order - or skipped entirely. Prioritize accordingly, Agent.

 

**SEASONAL JOURNEY**

We're introducing several updates aimed at making the Seasonal Journey more flexible and rewarding:

* Journey Missions 4,5, and 6 now unlock simultaneously after completing Mission 3. You can now tackle these missions in any order.
* Each mission is themed around a specific attribute - Firearms, Stamina, and Electronics - and focuses on related objectives and passives.

 

Passive Modifiers are no longer unlocked by completing entire missions. Instead, they're tied to specific objectives within Missions 4 through 7:

* Missions 4-6: The first two objectives in each unlock their respective attribute-base passives.
* Mission 6: Unlocks Hybrid passives through its first five objectives.

 

Active Modifiers continue to be unlocked by completing at least 6 objectives in Missions 3-6:

* Broken Link is granted automatically alongside the Global Modifier.
* Additional Active Modifiers are awarded based on total objectives completed within each mission.

 

Finally, Mission 7 becomes available once you've earned at least 4 Passive Modifiers from Missions 4-6.

This new structure allows for a more **gradual and customizable progression**, giving you the freedom to unlock passives and active modifiers in the order that best suits your build and playstyle.

 

# GEAR, WEAPONS & TALENTS

Gear up for new build opportunities: this season brings two new Named Weapons, several new Talents, and fresh additions with a new Gear and Brand Set.

Exotic enthusiasts have plenty to chase, too - a powerful new Exotic Holster, an exclusive Exotic Mask tied to the Climax Mission, and the return of a familiar face from The Division in the form of an Exotic RPK-74. If you remember the Pahkan, you'll want to make room in your loadout!

# MASTER CLIMAX MISSION

Successfully completing the Master Climax Mission for the first time guarantees players the Exotic Mask ""Tinkerer"" as a special reward.

While completing the Climax Mission on Master guaranteed the Tinkerer Mask, it can also drop at any difficulty - just with lower chances. The higher the difficulty, the better your odds.

 

# [Tinkerer Exotic Mask](https://i.imgur.com/ffmDpZ5.png)

**Talent Abridged**

If your Primary and Secondary weapon are **not Exotic or Named** and of the **same type**, the Secondary Weapon's talent will also be applied to the Primary Weapon.

* Doesn't apply to talents that include Weapon Swapping.
* Doesn't apply if the Primary and Secondary weapon have the same Talent.

 

# PLAYER ONBOARDING IMPROVEMENTS

We're making it easier for new Agents to learn the ropes and hit the ground running with two onboarding features: Milestone Builds and the new Level 40 Boost.

 

**Milestone Builds**

Milestone Builds are designed to help new players understand the basics of build-making through guided progression.

* One Milestone Cache is granted at each of the following levels: 8,15,25, and 35.
* Each Cache includes a strong weapon and gear pieces that work well together, encouraging players to experiment with synergy and loadout structure.
* Equipping the gear triggers quick explanations that highlight how pieces work together.

 

# QUALITY OF LIFE CHANGES

**Progression and Objectives**

* Seasonal Journey objectives can now be progressed while playing in co-op.
* Season XP rewards for all Living World Activities, Main Missions and Game Modes have been increased by 85%.

 

**Scavenging Points**

This season, we're updating how Scavenging Points work to create a more balanced and account-friendly system.

* **Scavenging Points are now shared across all characters** on your account. Hardcore characters have a separate pool.
* The shared pool becomes available once a character unlocks the SHD Watch.
* On first login, the available pool will be set to match the maximum amount earned by any single character on your account.
* From then on, any use of these points will **draw from the same account wide total**, meaning they can't be reused across multiple characters.

To support this change, we've tripled the resource rewards earned from Scavenging Points. This ensures better value and a smoother progression experience for all Agents.

 

|Resource|Y6S3|Y7S1|
|:-|:-|:-|
||||
|E-Credits|11500|34500|
|Ceramics|100|300|
|Polycarbonate|100|300|
|Steel|100|300|
|Carbon Fiber|75|225|
|Electronics|75|225|
|Titanium|75|225|
|Printer Filament|15|45|
|SHD Calibration|1|3|
|Field Recon Data|2|6|

We understand this is a big shift, that's why **you'll receive a one-time grant of 100% of your previously earned Scavenging Points** that one character would get, based on your SHDlevel, so you can spend them freely under the new system.

 

**Level 40 Boost**

The new Level 40 Boost offers a faster path to endgame content.

* It instantly levels a character to 40 and provides a full set of Level 40 gear.
* It can be purchased individually per character and is also **automatically granted** to anyone who owns the Battle for Brooklyn DLC.

 

**Other Changes**

* Fixed the issue with the “Combat Medic” talent on Birdie’s Quick Fix exotic backpack not working as intended.
* Fixed the issue with agents being unable to open caches when their inventory is full.
* Fixed the issue with mortars in the Y6S3 Climax Mission dealing full damage through props in Beat 4 and Beat 7, hitting players below with both the explosion and poison cloud.
* Fixed the issue with exotic skin textures not loading properly in the Apparel tab of the inventory.

 

# [SEASON PASS](https://i.imgur.com/FrQEigO.png)

However, I had a lot of friends try Elden Ring as their first FromSoft game because of the hype surrounding it.

I remember taking a look at the volunteer postings 10 years ago for this and seeing that they did not want any more composers or voice actors. To see that they're now requesting more music and VAs (for major roles at that) is a little odd.

"> but how difficult is it to get gameplay variety this type of game?

This is a demo I tried for a previous Steam Next Fest, honestly tapping out of due to poor quality / lack of fun and not covering it, but it seems to be finding it's way more as time goes on after trying the most recent edition of the demo. 

Dodge / block telegraphed attacks from expired food, taking care to keep an eye on your stamina meter / health as you launch your own attacks. Strikes can generate a power-punch token, being more effective if used as a counter-attack after dodging an incoming strike. Opponents can take multiple downs, recharging their health bar, while you are left with a single one; no pulling yourself to your feet or a count out in Leftovers KO. 

Still feel like there is work / improvements to be done on the mechanics, as the art style feels like the strongest thing going for Leftovers KO as-is.",comment_2,r/Games,Entertainment,,https://youtu.be/k8MwNstZXdU

"I enjoyed the game - for all its flaws, there were plenty of moments that stood out to me.

After this game, I feel like Id should take a break from Doom and focus on other dormant IPs, to better push itself as a developer. *I think we all know what I mean by that.*",comment_1,r/Games,Entertainment,,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wydL14tOa3s
"Civvie is *super* right about the weapons. The selection is super weak, and two of the weapons have variants that once you obtain them, there's no reason to *ever* use the previous version, unlike the Shotgun v Super Shotgun choice (While I used the super shotgun mostly, from what I've seen, the maxed out regular shotgun is disgustingly powerful), but the Plasma gun and the bone machine gun just outright give you upgrades.

Yeah the fire rate is slower, but their upgraded versions fire perfectly straight, do a *shitload* more damage, have upgrades that better suit their crowd control role, and, in the Plasma Gun's case, the double barrel version just gives you the main gimmick of the other version as a final upgrade anyways.

The upgrades themselves feel tacked on too, they feel more like stat boosts for most of the weapons, or like, a tiny gimmick added to the gun instead of the alternate fires in the previous games.

The explosive weapons are odd too, you have all these weird guns and... oh and here's a rocket launcher that has no interesting upgrades. I used the grenade launcher for most of the game because at least it was something different.

No notes on the chain flail gun though, that thing rules.",comment_2,r/Games,Entertainment,,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wydL14tOa3s

"HYPERxFANTASY - Onyx Prism - Experience the insanity of near-singularity future in this experimental RPG! Lost souls must be slain. Mankind will ascend. HYPERxFANTASY is an experimental narrative RPG where you explore a brutalist dystopia, slay lost souls and guide mankind into digital afterlife!

- Steam (with free DEMO): https://store.steampowered.com/app/2827080/HYPERxFANTASY?utm_source=rgames5
- YT Trailer shared by IGN (yahoo!): https://youtu.be/GQFPUB-5pwA 

This game is a twisted dive into a brutalist dystopia born from wild ideas and a love for the unpredictable bizarre. In this game, you play as Dreamer, tasked by the enigmatic Executor to “digitize everyone” and guide souls into a digital afterlife. Along the way, you help people fulfill their self-destructive desires as their final wishes before they cross over, all while uncovering a dark conspiracy fueled by a brainwashing cult and chaotic rituals that question the true cost of progress.

Combat in HYPERxFANTASY is all about precision, flow, and attentiveness. You must use LMB/RMB to attack from the sides where the enemy isn’t covering, requiring focus while remaining accessible and easy to learn.

As you explore, you glide through a sprawling brutalist megastructure that stretches into infinity. Soar over towering heights, dive into hidden crevices, and traverse paths that defy gravity and expectation—all on your steel-disc glider.

The storytelling in HYPERxFANTASY is as unconventional as the world itself. The narrative plays with chronology and even features gamedevs as characters. It unfolds through a blend of 2D sequences, text-based interactions, rhythm-based minigames, and “touch” minigames where you interact physically with your companions to channel the energy of the Singularity. Every element is crafted to immerse you in a surreal, thought-provoking experience that blurs the line between digital obsession and human desire.

If the madness is hard to imagine, you can try the DEMO now - I’d appreciate any feedback! Don’t forget to add HYPERxFANTASY to your wishlist if you like the game - you’ll get notified about the full release in Q3 2025.

**Please play the demo and wishlist the game, so we can let you know when the full game launches (we're aiming for July!)**

We're a small (4 people) indie team from Warsaw, Poland. We've recently re-launched our studio and we're doing our best to stay afloat and pay off our debts.

Guess who didn't manage to stay afloat in Pirate Cove Simulator? You! You were a pirate crew captain who managed to sail into a storm and get his ship wrecked, killing the crew... all of the crew. Yes, you too!

Now you're stuck in the pirate afterlife which happens to look like tropical paradise. What gives it off is the fact the place is crawling with undead pirates! Legend has it you can escape your fate if you can fill the Chest of the Damned with gold. You happen to be quite the merchant, so you set up shop on the island and start running a small distillery. Yes, undead pirates love their rum too, even if they keep spilling it on the floor through their empty ribcages. 

Oh, and there's also fishing, and hunting for treasure in our game too.

The demo has been gathering some very positive feedback so far, so please - join the fun!

The 2D art in the trailer too, just looks like the most basic AI gens you could get.


Even the 2D artwork in the Steam-Shop is AI. Very blatantly aping the Simpsons Artstyle. It has nothing to do with how the game looks.

Are there materials in the game to help you learn how to better identify different mushroom species that closely resemble each other? Or do all varieties look distinctly/very different in the game?

"Screenside Station — CG Games — Run a tiny train station on your desktop Hi r/Games! Screenside Station is the next generation of gaming, a graphics tour de force, a… wait, wrong script.

I liked the idea of a desktop game that only asks you to glance at it at specific times. Trains seemed like the perfect theme: they come on a schedule, always bring something interesting, and sound and look soothing.

Next, how to choose who visits? Clearly it’s going to be based on tourist attractions. Everything from a soccer ball, to an ice cream stand, to a shrine can bring in new visitors types. They spend a bit of money visiting their favorite attractions, which you can then use for more customization. And if you want to play more actively, you can drag and drop them onto decorations until their wallets run dry :P

It’s not a huge game, just something small and soothing, with a bit of relation to Animal Crossing and city building games. I hope that’s also useful to someone else out there! And by the way, in case you’d care, it’s developed in Godot.

A demo will be on Steam next week and when the game launches, I’m planning to price it at just $2.99.

"BIG LOOT - Reverie Clouds - roguelike caravan Survival Game about risk, loot, and smart trading Hi everyone!

After 1.5 years of late-night work after my day job, I finally have something playable to share. There's a free demo, and I’d love to hear what you think!

BIG LOOT is a roguelike caravan survival game about risk, loot, and smart trading.

**Choose your path** through a dangerous world:

* Safe routes with low rewards, or loot-rich paths full of threats
* **Upgrade your modular wagon** to survive longer and carry more
* Your **backpack physically stretches from loot**, gets heavier, and slows you down. Balance greed with survival
* Meet new traders in each town with **unpredictable offers** — trade smart and hunt for high-value deals

Every run is a journey of hard choices, clever upgrades, and the eternal question: Do I play it safe... or go for the BIG LOOT?



If it catches your interest, adding BIG LOOT to your **wishlist** would be a huge help 🙏

Hello again, everyone!

We've launch the demo for our game this past Thursday on Steam for everyone to try.

My name is Gene, I am the community manager for our team at Brigada Games. Quarantine Zone is our first game and we are pouring our previous experience working with UE4/5 as an outsource studio to make it as good as we can.

Game takes heavy inspiration from Papers, Please, Contraband Police & similar games. Players are tasked with commanding the last checkpoint, inspecting survivors, and deciding their fate: trust, quarantine, or liquidate.

On release, you will be able to expand your base, upgrade defenses, and fend off hordes. Every step shapes humanity’s survival. Every mistake cost lives of potential survivors. Meanwhile, we are focusing on polishing the core mechanics of checkpoint - screening of survivors for infection and quarantine process.

Consider joining our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/quarantinezonegame). It's a place where we share news/announcements for our progress, updates to demo and more.

I always wanted a competitive, skill-based game that wasn’t about killing, didn’t take 30 minutes per match, and focused on short, high-energy sessions. Rocket League is one of my all-time favorite games — but after nearly ten years, I’ve been itching for something fresh. I figured if no one else was going to make it, I might as well give it a shot. If even a few people love it as much as I do, it’ll have been worth it.

I have not been able to put it down since Thursday night.


This game is incredibly charming and packed with so much to do.  While each Job (in-game Life) has its similarities, the fact that they build upon on another feels really rewarding.


Want a new shield for my Paladin Job?  I'll just switch over to Blacksmith and craft it.  Oh, but I could craft an even better one if I had some Logs.  I'll just switch over to Carpenter and take care of that.  But I'll need to level up Woodcutter.

My favorite time spent in FFXIV was as an Omni-Crafter and this game seems to encourage the same mentality.


If you wanted to focus on one or two Lifes, the game has Merchants that will sell you the goods from the other Lifes (at normal quality), but I find it really rewarding when exploring a new area to be able to grab everything.



Also, and this is low key maybe one of its best features, no inventory limits!

"It definitely feels like the biggest mistake they have ever made in Playstations history where a costly move like this hasn't yielded any success stories outside of Helldivers 2.

Like as bad as the PS3 launch was, at least the console was able to straighten itself out within a few years and we started getting great games with amazing graphics like The Last of Us, Uncharted 2 and 3, Metal Gear Solid 4, God of War 3, Killzone 2 and 3 etc. It is hard to see the live service push have any kind of redemption in the end",comment_3,r/Games,Entertainment,,https://bsky.app/profile/mauronl.bsky.social/post/3lpwfdufqqs24

"I played from the release of International to late Ijji era, it was one of my favorite games.

Still find it hard to belive that despite making so much money with it's ruthless microtransactions, there was never a game to really replace it.

The devs were unfortunately very unpleasant people, they tried to dictate how the game was played and actually ""fixed"" all the animation cancelling early on but gave up only after massive outcry to return them.
As they released GunZ 2 they pretty much forced people to play like they envisioned with weapons tied to characters and very limited animation cancelling along with even shittier system of gambling for gear (imagine a draw a lot system where everyone competes for the prize and it resets after someone gets it, resulting in people camping it until clueless players drew enough to make it more likely and then everyone going all in).

Hopefully the new owners will manage the ""remaster"" well enough, based on the discussion on subreddit and discord they are trying to remove the p2w parts of microtransactions and implementing some modern quality of life stuff.",comment_5,r/Games,Entertainment,,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mi5rxkwvwYc

"Tezzel: The Tilemaker’s tale - Old Mayor Studios - A Gaudí inspired logic puzzle that my friends can’t stop playing Hi everyone! I’m Juli, a solo developer, and I just launched the Steam page for my first commercial game: **Tezzel: The Tilemaker’s Tale**. It’s a handcrafted 2D puzzle game inspired by Gaudí’s architectural wonders and the vivid colors of Barcelona.

The store page is now live, and I’d love for you to check it out:

Steam: https://store.steampowered.com/app/3703730/?utm_source=r10

Trailer: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqnoghwh1Dk

**Why I think you’ll like this game:**

Tezzel is the kind of game that grabs people, and doesn’t let go. My friends can’t stop playing it. Some love logic games, others don’t usually go for puzzles at all, but they’re all getting hooked. What draws them in is the sense of discovery, the challenge, and that moment when a tricky puzzle finally clicks.

Each level asks you to think differently. The mechanics evolve as you progress, and new tools open up new types of challenges. No two puzzles feel alike, and each one pushes your problem-solving skills in a fresh way.

**What makes Tezzel special:**

-> Every level you complete becomes a colorful tile that fills your grand masterwork of a wall. Complete 100 levels to finish your creation.

-> Never-seen-before mechanics. The blocks that craft the tiles move in unique ways, but they also paint the floor and create physical barriers for other blocks, adding unexpected layers of complexity.

-> Unlock new tile-making tools as you progress: Paint, Hammer, Stylus, Compass, and more. Each introduces new movement mechanics and puzzle dynamics.

-> Non-linear progression. Stuck on a puzzle? Skip ahead and keep building, there are always more tiles to place on the wall.

-> Pixel art inspired by Gaudí’s modernism and the colors of Barcelona.

Tezzel: The Tilemaker’s Tale will be coming to **PC (Windows, macOS, and Linux)**.

A **free demo is coming next month**, and the full game is in its final stages of development. If you enjoy puzzle games with **fresh, innovative mechanics and satisfying progression**, I’d be honored if you gave Tezzel a wishlist or left your thoughts below.

**I’ll be around today to answer any questions or chat in the comments, feel free to ask me anything.**

"I wouldn't say she's an influencer. She has 25,000 Instagram followers and 15,000 on TikTok, but doesn't post brand deals or content that would constitute being an influencer. She mostly posts about her book or her family. Having a few thousand followers doesn't make someone an influencer, especially when most of those followers probably came from the documentary being made. 

For those who don't want to read the clickbait article, she's written two books: one memoir about her dad's murder and the trial; and a children's book about grief.

"Secrets that we keep! This show is a must watch! Definitely screamed “the perfect couple” vibes of a rich family on Netflix . Where are they from? Missed that. Anyway this show was hard to watch but also weirdly realistic in a very weird way. Like what in the world would so many of us do in this situation?? It’s that insane. If we found out our nanny was dealing with our child in this fashion. I don’t have words.

In addition there is so much going on. So many different dynamic characters and the scenery. Loved Cecille. You can tell she’s independent of her husband (her office is literally on the water or wherever she works) and i just had the vibes of how he never talks back to her (I know men who think their better then their wives). Aka that beautiful house is 100% half hers and well earned. I’m convinced she makes more than the lawyer husband. Again, she didn’t say it outright but she mentioned the neighbor is his biggest client and looked completely un phased like the true queen she is. Every woman that makes their own money (usually more) knows this discussion well with their man. And it shows. 

Have yall watched this on Netflix? Thoughts?",post,r/netflix,Entertainment,28.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/netflix/comments/1kvqy5w/secrets_that_we_keep/
Yep really enjoyed it and actually it was a lot more nuanced than I originally gave it credit for. Like the sex scene between the main couple was pretty off till you find out what you find out later on and then you see that whole scene in a different light. Really enjoyed it.

"I liked that Cecilia had a mind of her own, but flat out ignoring Rose's request for help from the onset seemed out of character.

The neighbor Katarina, gives a Chrissy Teigen vibe, she played that role perfectly. Katarina definitely married up, and embraces the most toxic traits of a newly rich person.

Celcilia's husband also married up and seems to resent her by sneering at her wealth during arguments.

Both sons and their friends were little predators. Proving that even when you have all the money in the world, being a good parent and teaching children values and respect can go a long way. 

I like that they showed the sacrifices made by Phillipino women to care for their families.

The ending unfortunately reinforced that rules aren't for the wealthy.",comment_2,r/netflix,Entertainment,,https://www.reddit.com/r/netflix/comments/1kvqy5w/secrets_that_we_keep/

"Sirens !!!Spoilers for Sirens!!!

Okay I just finished Sirens and I need to rant (I apologize this is long)

I hate Devon. Like with a burning passion.

She called her sister a wh\*re for sending fruit then sucks a guy off because she can't smoke??? And then licks the guy who drives her to a hotel???? Goes to a bar want just wanting to f\*ck?? Then f\*cks a gardner. And not to mention she's been sleeping with a married man. Pot is calling the kettle black here.

Shows up to her sister's work and threatens to basically cause trouble for her instead of just waiting later to talk like her sister asked.

Is rude to her sister's boss before even really knowing her and then says that she should have been told her sister got a nose job as if Simone isn't an adult and can make her own choices.

Demands her sister move back and help with their father. I get siblings should but she offered to help with money which would be good cause it sounds like he needs a home nurse or go to a place where they can take care of him full time or someone who can take care of him full time. Either sibling spending all their time taking care of a parent is not it. And let's not forget the dad neglected and abused Simone, so why would she want to help in the first place.

Says personal stuff about their life to random people SHE DOESN'T EVEN KNOW!!!!

Goes to the party after Simone told her to stay in the house until she was done with work and she shows up causing problems. No respect for Simone at all.

They give her money to take care of her dad because Simone doesn't want her there and demands her sister come home???? Like what. She clearly doesn't want to go. A sibling showing up to their siblings work and demanding their grown adult sibling to go home with them when it's clear the sibling doesn't want to is beyond wild.

Talks about how her boss is controlling AS IF DEVON ISN'T. Girl is trying to force her sister home to take care of their dad because she doesn't want to do it alone and thinks Simone's owes her and wants her on meds. Says ""You're going to buffalo with me"" like huh?!?! How is that not controlling?

Believed strangers about gossip and ran with it. Gossip she heard in jail by a drunk lady who couldn't even remember Devon's name.

Simone doesn't owe her anything. Simone was in an abusive environment before Devon come back and when her sister was somewhere else she shows up demanding she return home to help take care of their dad. And tries to guilt her into coming back when she refuses multiple times. What person wants to help someone who neglected and abused them and furthered their trauma?? And even says ""You don't feel any responsibility for him?"" um no. Since when are children supposed to be indebted to their abusers. And then she tries to tell her ""You sound like a b\*tch off your meds"". You mean her anxiety meds? The ones her doctor told her she doesn't need to take because you can heal from it. Then says ""you are only alive because of me"", and that means she owes you? She then left her to be abused/neglected and are actively trying to manipulate her, she owes her nothing. And then storms away saying ""You don't need me anymore well good f\*cken luck"" as if Simone hasn't been doing things on her own for 10 years!!!! Like dear lord.

Later kinda blames her drinking and DUI on someone else as if they forced her to. Like you chose to drink he just drank with you. And got mad when he offered her a drink, which is what she normally does and she yells at him. He didn't even know she was sober when she yelled at him!! Like girl you are the problem.

Simone isn't a saint at all but dear god why is Devon so insufferable. The ultimate victim mentality. I get she's mad and has trauma but dear lord above.

And honestly I don't see how Peter is a monster either. The ending seems like Devon and Michaela are calling him one. But like what did he do that's monstrous? Sure he lied about going to see his son and grandchild, not exactly a terrible thing and completely understandable. Yes he kissed Simone and it wasn't right but neither pursued it after until Michaela fired her. And Michaela then fires her knowing what the job means to her and lies about it because she wants to get the upper hand on Peter or to keep her marriage that isn't exactly working anyway cause neither are very happy (wasn't very clear to me). Like no one in this situation is really a monster or all that terrible. Honestly the worst people to me are Devon and Ethan. Devon for all the reasons above and Ethan cause man over stepped his bounds  and didn't respect her privacy then acted like a man child and wouldn't take no for an answer at first then was being a jerk.

"I liked Devon's role in the show, but I agree that the producers took it too far. I also don't understand what the point of the BJ in the boat was. I think her over-sexual drive wasn't really explored. If the only point was to show her as unhinged, it didn't really do it for me.   
  
I also didn't get the screaming at Kiki at the Gala on last episode. Maybe the point of that was to show how everyone else doesn't mind looking the other way, the same way as when Kiki is kicked out and Simon replaces her, people just keep on with the Gala as if everything was normal.",comment_1,r/netflix,Entertainment,,https://www.reddit.com/r/netflix/comments/1kvp1e4/sirens/
"I think you may have missed the point. No one in the show is a monster. We’re led to believe that Michaela *is* a monster, and in the end the message is that she isn’t. This message applies to the other characters as well. It’s about circumstances and how they shape who you become. That’s my take, anyways.

Edit to add: When we look at actual harm caused, the “monster” in the story is the father. He put Simone through hell. Neglected her horribly. But he was clinically depressed and generally deeply troubled. So, the show wants us to recognize that humans are capable of doing great harm, but that doesn’t negate their humanity. 

Michaela groomed Simone. She was deeply narcissistic and preyed on Simone’s deep-seated desperation for a mother figure. Devon was caught up in what she felt she was “owed” for taking care of Simone and making sacrifices for her, and this was also harmful, deeply unfair, and reflective of her flaws. Simone became selfish and disconnected from her basic empathy in the end, and that’s a shame, but it makes sense for her situation and everything she’s been put through. Michaela’s husband was kinder to the staff than Michaela, was shown to be a kinder person in general, but still displayed deep classism and ended up taking a 25 year old as a trophy wife and abandoning Michaela with no money and ripped away her one true passion from her (raptor rehabilitation). He was also awful in his own ways.

All the main characters in the show are deeply flawed and cause harm to the people around them. That doesn’t make any of them monsters. That’s the point.",comment_2,r/netflix,Entertainment,,https://www.reddit.com/r/netflix/comments/1kvp1e4/sirens/
"Lol I appreciate your post, especially bc I spent the last 2 days watching this series & it's still fresh in my head. 

I think most of your rant can be resolved by Devons comment to Kiki about how sisters can be brutal to each other.. but will still love each other more deeply than any non-sister-havers. 

And I think a lot of your frustration about their complicated emotions & relationship dynamics was exactly what the writers intended.",comment_3,r/netflix,Entertainment,,https://www.reddit.com/r/netflix/comments/1kvp1e4/sirens/
I think this show is somewhat satirical. JS.,comment_4,r/netflix,Entertainment,,https://www.reddit.com/r/netflix/comments/1kvp1e4/sirens/
"I feel exactly the same way. Devon is an incredibly annoying, affected character and I had to laugh when the writers clearly didn’t know how to keep her writing consistent and one night she buys a sexy dress and high heels at the hotel shop and knows perfectly how to walk in the heels, and next day when Kiki leaves some dress and shoes for her to change into, she’s limping around like someone who’s never worn heels before.

Also, what the fuck was it with the last minute “he’s in love with me” situation between Simone and Peter? I thought I actually skipped an episode where their relationship was shown to have grown.

"Foreign subtitles on English text when watching in English I've got the weirdest problem and an hour on google & reddit hasn't helped. When I'm watching shows in English any text on screen in English, signs, text messages etc, has subtitles in a foreign language. 

I don't know why this has started and can't find any way to turn it off. I've checked every device I use Netflix on and they're all set to audio English and subtitles off. 

Can't be the only one who has had this, how do I make it stop?

Edit: so if someone speaks a foreign language on screen I get the same thing, the subtitles are in another language when they should be in English. However if I skip back 10 or 20 seconds and the subtitles automatically come on for the time I’ve skipped back they’re all in English",post,r/netflix,Entertainment,2.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/netflix/comments/1kvwfb4/foreign_subtitles_on_english_text_when_watching/

"It baffles me how Netflix never improves the inaccurate subtitles for a lot of their foreign content at all. I just saw my mother watching some foreign nonsense called The Sea Beyond earlier today. Not sure what it's all about, didn't really give a dang to find out. All I know about it was that it's another random foreign show Netflix has in its catalog, and it is one with horrid translation issues. And with this one, it's the worst I've ever seen with any of them as the subtitles were on as she watched it and literally NOTHING was matching what the actors, or rathe yet the DUBBED actors, were reciting or saying AT ALL!

That's been a major issue I've had with Neflix for years now when it comes to how they handle captions and subtitles for foreign shows and here, it's far more worse than any other one I've seen. I don't know why they never fixed that issue, but when it comes to the hard of hearing, it really does them a disservice more when they don't realize what they're reading doesn't match of to what they're watching.

Especially when they're charging nearly thirty bucks a month for the bloody thing. With all that they could've been able afford to improve their subtitle tech. Use AI on that for improved accuracies or something , if they want.",post,r/netflix,Entertainment,15.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/netflix/comments/1kvcffe/it_baffles_me_how_netflix_never_improves_the/

I personally tend to like the translation better than the American dubbing.  Sometimes you have to check a couple of the subtitle choices to get something to match the dubbing, though it’s true that that’s not always available.

"It’s a matter of preference on the dubbing I suppose.  I usually find the literal translation to make more sense.

It would be nice if they would provide the captions for the dubbing every time.  Like I said, I’ve had some success with the captions being for the dubbed version while the English subtitles are the literal translation.   I think part of it may be that the voiceovers are done by a separate entity from the original producers, but I’m not sure exactly how all that works.

I do know that Netflix doesn’t control the captions on the films they don’t make themselves.

Suddenly I don't see the point of love...
Especially when one holds trauma deep in them ... 

Because in the end ... After the honeymoon phase is over ... I feel like it's just wrong for your partner to heal wounds they had no part in forming...

The courtship is the part he likes the most because it is a hunt. He likes hunting his prey. That is why he frequently grows bored each time he got a happy ending - he wants to keep hunting, he doesn't actually want love just the pursuit.

Joe wasn't rejected by his partners because he had trauma, he was rejected because they saw him for what he truly was: a predator.

A Deadly American Marriage: Interview with Jason Corbett's daughter,post,r/netflix,Entertainment,28.0,https://www.glamour.com/story/sarah-corbett-lynch-of-a-deadly-american-marriage-is-finding-her-voice-and-wont-stop-using-it
"AI summary of the article: 

Here’s a summary of the **Glamour interview with Sarah Corbett Lynch**, and yeah—she’s incredibly impressive considering everything she’s survived:

# 💔 Background:

Sarah was just 6 years old when her stepmother **Molly Martens** and Molly’s father **Tom**, a former FBI agent, **bludgeoned her father Jason Corbett to death**. She and her brother Jack were **manipulated into lying** for Molly, only to later recant and speak the truth: **they were emotionally and physically abused**.

# 💪 Who Sarah is now:

* **18 years old**, living in Ireland, raised by her aunt Tracey and uncle David.
* **Author of two books**:
   * *Noodle Loses Dad* (written at age 13 for kids grieving a parent).
   * *A Time For Truth* (a powerful memoir detailing her abuse and her father’s murder).
* **Swim instructor & certified diver** who turned a toxic experience into something healing.
* Studying **criminal justice** and using her voice to advocate for other abuse survivors.

# 🔥 Key points from the interview:

* She believes Jason’s death was **premeditated and possibly recorded**, with Molly having planted a recording device that mysteriously vanished.
* Molly began grooming her early—telling her at age 6 that her dad killed her mom, teaching her to shoplift, and even making her **throw up to stay skinny**.
* Sarah’s book and the Netflix documentary were about **reclaiming her voice** after being silenced in court.
* She says **writing the book was therapy** and allowed her to forgive her younger self for being manipulated.
* Despite years of trauma, she now says: **“There’s always light at the end of the tunnel—and you have a voice.”**

# 🎤 Mic drop:

"Question on Sirens New Show Just binged Sirens – loved it but confused about one thing (Simone)

So I just powered through Sirens in a day (don’t judge me lol) and honestly, it was hilarious. Super fun watch. I thought the ending was perfect — Peter trading in his wife for a younger, better-looking one? Iconic. Good for him 😂

But one thing kinda confused me… why was the whole staff so happy and even playing music when Simone got fired? I mean yeah, she was a little intense and definitely had that boss energy, but I didn’t really catch her being straight-up rude to everyone. Did I miss something? Or was it more subtle? Just felt like there was something I wasn’t picking up on.

Also, Devon. Man. It felt like she was kinda in love with being miserable? Like her sister chose a life of comfort and happiness, and Devon just could not wrap her head around it. It’s like she couldn’t grasp that maybe not everyone wants to be in the struggle all the time lol.

"I think the staff was a little unfair about their dislike of Simone, she was just carrying out the boss’s orders. There were many times where she said “Michaela says…”. Don’t shoot the messenger.

I also completely agree about Devon wanting to be miserable. Say what you will about the morality of what Simone chose at the end, but Devon just going back and acting so righteous and like she’s never going to see Simone again is so unrealistic.

"It's the way Simone ingratiated herself to Kiki, almost like a ""teacher's pet."" At the same time, Kiki gave her special treatment while she had her carry out orders on her behalf. Kiki barely acknowledged or appreciated her other staff at all, e.g. the smoothies, communicating through Simone, etc. 

Rather than seeing herself as in the same boat as the rest of the staff (easily disposable, needing to walk on eggshells around these rich people and stick together) Simone relished Kiki's special treatment, and it alienated her from the rest of her coworkers.",comment_5,r/netflix,Entertainment,,https://www.reddit.com/r/netflix/comments/1kug7ej/question_on_sirens_new_show/
"Why is there a storage limit for Smart Downloads? Hi it's my first post here,

I have been recently running into this issue where I cannot set Netflix's Smart Downloading feature to use more than 9.5gb of storage and don't know why this is a case, I have tried this on both Android 10 and Android 15 thinking it might of been a container-based issue with the way Google have Implemented a feature that restricts what files apps have access to, I found this wasn't the case and I thought this might of just been a cap assigned by netflix probably because of licencing, I tried searching this up and I found that this cap seemed to be undocumented as of my current research and so I don't know if this is just a problem with me. I do have Netflix Premium so I don't know why this could be a problem since it's noted that premium has more features compared to the other plans and it just says I can download on up to 6 supported devices at a time but never specified how much I could download.

"There's a long history in South America of indigenous people protesting. Initially it was transport unions nationwide that went on strike. Gas prices doubled overnight. Bus fares went from $0.25 to $0.40 overnight. There were violent clashes only about a mile from where I was staying. I was there to climb two mountains (only managed one - I'm lucky I did that). After the unions made an agreement to end the strike, young people in Quito got involved. Then countrywide indigenous people got involved. I was in Cotopaxi national park to climb and when we were leaving, the indigenous had actually blockaded every exit. I was essentially smuggled back to Quito in the middle of the night a couple days later. The day I got back there were tens of thousands of the indigenous that were in Quito clashing with national police. Homemade mortars, etc. You could hear the sounds where I was staying. 

Didn't make world news until about almost a week in. When I started posting pictures the first day, my mom told me, ""I've seen nothing about this.""

For more info, see:

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/JetBlue_Flight_292

> JetBlue Flight 292 was a scheduled flight from Bob Hope Airport in Burbank, California to John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York City. On September 21, 2005, Captain Scott Burke executed an emergency landing in the Airbus A320-200 at Los Angeles International Airport after the nose gear jammed in an abnormal position.[1] No one was injured.

> The pilots flew the aircraft, which can carry up to 46,860 pounds (21,260 kg) of aviation fuel, in a figure eight pattern between Bob Hope Airport in Burbank and LAX for more than two hours in order to burn fuel and lower the risk of fire upon landing. This also served to lighten the plane, reducing potential stress on the landing gear and dramatically lowering landing speed as well.[4][5] The Airbus A320 does not have the mechanical ability to dump fuel,[6] despite various news agencies reporting that the aircraft was doing so over the ocean.

> Because JetBlue planes are equipped with DirecTV satellite television, passengers on Flight 292 were able to watch live news coverage of their flight while the plane circled over the Pacific for hours. The in-flight video system was turned off ""well before landing.""[7] Actress Taryn Manning was on the flight on her way to New York to promote the film Hustle & Flow.[8] Screenwriter Zach Dean was also on the plane, and while contemplating his mortality resolved to write a script about mortality (which eventually became the film Deadfall).[9]

"What minor character in a movie do you think had a big impact on the film? The Warden in Shutter Island (2010), played by Ted Levine, gave one of the most chilling performances I’ve ever seen. He may be in the movie for less than five minutes, but him sharing his beliefs about violence with DiCaprio’s character, Teddy Daniels, left a lasting impression on me that I will never forget.

"Rat Race (2001) Throwback Hollywood, ensemble, hilarious, adventure fun! Almost for the whole family (except for a couple of risqué scenes maybe).

What a hoot revisiting this! Thought all the cast did well actually and it was well acted and directed, even if the script and production values nor the overall film are Oscar worthy.

The ""you should have bought a squirrel"" car twist with Whoopi after Kathy Bates' cameo and the later WWII veterans convention where Jon Lovitz' family crash into and his unintentional Hitler disaster were funny as! And Rowan Atkinson's performance was brilliant. John Cleese is always handy as well. And the flying cow LOL (""Twister"" flashbacks)!

"Finding new films I'm predicting that movie discovery will get more and more difficult as time passes. Already IMDb lists upwards of 700,000 movies, and I expect that number to grow exponentially as it becomes easier to make and distribute high quality feature-length content. So while in the past we would just watch whatever was on Cartoon Network or HBO, now we have to make an active choice.

A counterpoint is that services like Netflix will eventually have so much of your data that they'll know what you want to watch even before you, but I think that there's certain types of data (real-time / in-the-moment data such as ""mood"") that they're still overlooking.

I'm curious to know **how you all find your next watch**, what **problems you face**, and **how you've got around them in the past.**",post,r/Film,Entertainment,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/FIlm/comments/1kw9f10/finding_new_films/

"What Is Your Favorite Scene Appropriating An Existing Song? I just recently finished ""Wild At Heart"" and I fell in love with the movie. I think Nicholas Cage and Laura Dern have performed one of the most weirdest but most entertaining and romantic messy couples I've seen in any movie and it's one of the best roadtrip films of all time. And one of the things I love the most is the iconic ending of the film where Nicholas Cage sings [""Love Me Tender""](https://youtu.be/_v1VBgN5itk?si=dd8OhvvLiRaA9gD5), a song originally sung by Elvis Presley. Not only does Nicholas Cage have a genuinely amazing voice but it's a powerful symbolic scene where Sailor opens up about his deep genuine love for Lula and devotes himself to a more responsible relationship over leaving it due to guilt and personal failures. And this is how I came inspired tot make this post.

I should give mention to the ""Blues Brothers"", one of the best comedy and musicals of all time, as having [many](https://youtu.be/EHV0zs0kVGg?si=5PbgRpxSDox_oLDX), [many](https://youtu.be/-_KkgPRo4wA?si=EDiVymnisqexKZvb), [many](https://youtu.be/HFduMlfeu9U?si=n5jbNW6v3H-pd7Z9) iconic scenes where they sing many preexisting songs.

Also, ""Whisper Of The Heart"" , which not only beautifully references [""Country Roads""](https://youtu.be/TjqRLIS5-ro?si=yqXfOuRmXYJj64YN) (sadly, cocouldt find the actual scene) but [it's greatly thematically reincorporated it](https://www.reddit.com/r/ghibli/s/jRhZFbrxbd)in the story and serves as the main protagonist's character development of both herself and her ability to write.",post,r/Film,Entertainment,2.0,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1kvuxwf

"What are some films which are very implicitly anti-fascist? (Not as pure metaphor but as background radiation of a larger story.) **Millennium Actress (2001)** - While ""Millennium Actress"" is mainly a story about love, passion, art, cinema, nostalgia and blurring line of reality and fantasy, the film does have underneath a critique of Imperial Japan through the subjective memories of Chiyoko. Her love interest is presented as not just a painter but a revolutionary who is running away from the Japanese secret and military police as he seems to be putting a stop to their goals. We are implicitly hinted to the Japanese invasion of Manchuria, where the man was also in hiding. They're consistently portrayed as an authoritarian antagonist in the story and it is because of them that Chiyoko never gets to reunite with the love of her life as he was captured and then tortured until he died. One of the main officers later appears as an old man expressing his regrets for his crimes. The movie also explores the dated gender norms of the time. Chiyoko originally wasn't gonna become a famous and inspiring actress due to the fact fhat his mother wanted her to become a traditional housewife rather than seek for her own autonomy and goals and the man is the one who inspires to rebel against this destiny for her.

**Grave Of The Fireflies (1980)** - This is a film that mostly focuses on siblinghood, the consequences of war on the innocent/civilians and self-preservation but there's an interesting theme of pride as an emotion that builds up the ultimate tragedy of the film. Seita and Setsuko's aunt acts cruel to both characters due to the fact that, as children, they're not doing enough to earn their right to stay and because there's a war going on, there's a lack of resources to keep them afloat. In it of itself, this wouldn't imply any fascistic biases but the aunt makes a particular sparky comment where she describes them as being useless and that unlike the Japanese military, they're doing the work necessary to be given the rights to the privileges of food and shelter. Through this comment, we are given attention to the irony of their situation. The aunt is shown to be holding on to a nationalistic belief which decides the value of a person. This nationalism and supremacy is in great part the reason why Imperial Japan has committed the war crimes which would be consequential to the endangerment of its population and what would lead in part lead to the bombings of their cities. We see a small moment where a random citizen is pointlessly waving the Japanese flag as he expresses his submissiveness to the emperor. Seita is also himself a victim of his own masculine and national pride. We see him glamorize the fact that his father is one of the soldiers who is fighting for their country and when it is revealed that Japan has lost the war, he is devastated by this. This is what defines a part of his own identity. The idea of the military and and how they purely exist to help and expand their nation. And it is partially his stubbornness against his aunt and his desire to be a hero and protector to her sister that they eventually starve to death in their isolation from the rest of society",post,r/Film,Entertainment,34.0,https://i.redd.it/3x9egitssw2f1.jpeg

"People here aren't going to like this advice, but you have to work on cheap/free stuff as a DP at first to build your reel and network. Music videos, student projects, spec work.

Stay in G&E or make the switch to camera department to stay afloat and learn from more experienced DPs. Try learning a more niche skill like being a colorist or steadicam operator that pairs well with being the kind of DP you'd like to be. 

If possible, you can add value by owning your own camera, but I know that's not realistic for everyone. You can offset a little by sub-renting it through a rental house like DFI.

"Former LA Entertainment Professionals in the DC Area — Casual Meetup? Hi everyone,

I recently relocated from Los Angeles to the DC area (DMV for the locals) to take some space, clear my head, and realign a bit. I’ve spent the last several years working in the entertainment industry — primarily in development at HBO and DreamWorks, as well as in writers’ rooms for Netflix animated series and Audible narrative projects.

Now that I’m in DC, I’ve found myself really missing the collaboration, shorthand, and camaraderie that comes from being around other LA industry folks. To be honest, I’m grieving it a little — I miss the energy, the pace, and just being surrounded by people who understand the work and the grind.

If there are any other former LA-based film/TV professionals now living in the DMV, I’d love to organize a casual meetup. Nothing fancy — just coffee, conversation, and a chance to connect with others who’ve made a similar move.

If this sounds like something you’d be interested in, feel free to comment or DM me. Would love to hear from you.",post,r/FilmIndustryLA,Entertainment,8.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/FilmIndustryLA/comments/1ksweno/former_la_entertainment_professionals_in_the_dc/

"I'm a filmmaker (camera operator, 17+ years) and a lifelong computer nerd. I also had a pretty bad compulsive DVD buying habit in the late 1990's and early 2000's. 

Hollywood has always fought whatever it should embrace, and sometimes it survived to pretend as though it was all intentional. All of the studios sued Sony back in the 1980's to block the release of the Betamax VTR (and then the VHS VCR took over), and the case went to the SCOTUS. 

Hollywood sued to block the release of the technology that would save it's biscuits in the 1980's and 1990's. Most of the studios were in horrible financial shape, and the home video market basically saved them and revitalized Hollywood. When the technology shifted to DVD's, Hollywood went with it, but there was something different: home video rentals. VHS tapes had a negotiated price with Blockbuster and other home video rental stores, so customers could be triple dipped; you paid money to the movie when you:

1. Saw it in theaters the first time. 

2. Rented it on VHS or eventually DVD. 

3. Bought it on home video if you wanted to own it (months after the video rentals were saturated and down)

DVD's had a different deal; they could be released prior to the common 12-month delay that video rental stores utilized. Further, more people owned a DVD player as ""home video"" became more popular, so why rent the movie in #2 above when you can just buy it at #3? So the rental market tanked, eventually dooming Blockbuster since Netflix would just ship you the DVD and let you keep it however long (so long as you had an active subscription).

Hollywood went from making $$$ on 1-3 above, to making only $$. Doesn't seem like much, but when the average movie ticket was $5 in the late 1990's, plus home video rental market ($100 per tape sold), plus home VHS or DVD being $19.99, that's a lot of money from a single audience member or household. Then $$ became just the admission + DVD purchase (cutting out home video rentals significantly); still great for Hollywood, but it was a huge drop in revenue. 

All of the studios were ready to go all-in on streaming, and COVID certainly hastened their entry to the market (Disney+ was barely ready, HBO Max was out in full force by May 2020, etc). They all over-leveraged themselves to have a streaming platform entirely because of Netflix showing a streamed library could be a revenue-producing asset. However, Netflix is Netflix, and their revenue and production financing model is vastly different from a Disney+ streaming platform. Simply: they're Disney. Netflix needs the $. Disney needs the $$$ (and more). 

Add on to that the fact that studios were only financing ""BIG BUDGET"" projects that were over $100 million. Since their $$ was only Box Office and then home video sales, the Box Office had to be BIG since home video sales/streaming/rentals wasn't the big $ it once was. So studios stopped making and releasing a lot of movies, and instead focused on big budget projects that, on paper, could become long term assets for those libraries. How will they make money in the future? Who knows, but build it now!

How did Hollywood get the consistent ""big budget"" money from investors? By diversifying their portfolio of assets into more real estate, especially commercial real estate, in the late 2010's. WB spent billions selling off the WB ranch and real estate to acquire office space. Universal Studios expanded their lots, and everyone learned to leverage their real estate portfolio as collateral for their financing deals. 

COVID gutted the commercial real estate market, and the bubble burst. When I was working during COVID, companies were paying me $250 to get my nose swabbed on a day off, and then paid my rate on the shoot day(s). They had the cash to continue shooting during COVID, but Hollywood's psychotic working hours and work/life imbalance made production en masse impossible. 

Now debt is much more expensive, and the asset requirements to collateralize a loan is more significant, so they simply cannot afford to bankroll anything that doesn't have a long term to it. That's why every project pitched to studios now must have an opportunity for multiple movies, prequels, television mini-series, etc. Hollywood was ready to try and ""shoot their way out"" in 2023, but the strikes came, and Hollywood needed to plan everything overseas to get it done. By last summer, the damage was done, and now they are trapped. 

Warner Bros was just downgraded by S&P to ""junk rating"" for their debt (over $25 billion, and that's after they just reduced it from $36 billion in 2024). Disney is telling Kevin Feige that Marvel movies need more visual spectacle and less social activism (because that's what sells movie tickets, in their estimation). Paramount is desperately looking for a buyer. Meanwhile, new studios are being teased all over the country, from Tyler Perry's $800 million studio in Georgia to Netflix stages in New Jersey (after they totally reneged on agreements in New Mexico). 

It's the same debt trap that Americans are getting caught in right now: debt becomes overwhelming when buying power reduces. The studios are all under water, and they don't know what content to make. 

People will blame the strikes, but it's easy to blame labor demanding more from greedy studios that literally continue to pay themselves tens of millions of dollars per year DESPITE their price/earnings ratio being below 0 (meaning they lose money for every dollar they spend on revenue). 

Hollywood has always fought what would save them. At this moment, they don't need a new technology or new superhero movie. Two of the most successful movies in the last 3 years were ""Barbie"" and ""Sinners"", both with social commentary and entertainment. But here comes Hollywood to convince people they want yet another fucking ""Superman"" movie, and a dinosaur movie with ScarJo, and more lightsabers. 

The youth are begging for the Beatles, and Hollywood keeps giving them only Franky Avalon.

Hollywood will be dead in the water until fresh money gets to filmmakers like Greta Gerwig and Ryan Coogler. The fact is the indie film market has prepared and trained a LOT of directors that are ready and capable of directing Hollywood movies with a reasonable <$100 million budget. But they can't have TOO many options in theaters at one time, especially not foreign-made foreign productions (gotta tariff them, somehow). 

Having an equivalent of DVD is, at this time, not what they need. They need filmmakers making films, not studio heads. They need movies that challenge people, tell new stories, and reflects the modern world we live in.

"PA is very much entry level and can lead down a lot of avenues, but career growth is not guaranteed the way it is in most industries.
 
PA trajectory can be very different for Set PAs, Office PAs, Post PAs, Writers PAs, and PAs working in commercial/short form.
 
Generally, Set PA can work many many many hours and work their way up to being an Assistant Director. But being on set gives you the most opportunity to interface with different departments. So if you have interest in something like Art department or camera, a lot of time you can make friends with people who will hire you into their department at their entry level. (Be aware, camera especially is competitive and you often get passed over for somebody important's son)
 
Office PAs generally promote into Production Coordinators or supervisors. For Writer's PAs usually the hope is that they'll eventually promote into a position like script coordinator and eventually become a writer in the room. This is tough but possible, as a lot of shows have short lifespans and limited opportunity to promote. 
 
Commercial/Short form PA gives a little more direct access to the creative team, so there is theoretically more opportunity to be promoted into a role like UPM, producer, or even take a stab at directing if a team likes you. But the work is often inconsistent. 
 
Post-PA is likely where your techy skills would most likely be appealing. Generally Post-PAs are reasonably linear in moving up to Post-Coordinators & eventually Post-Producers.
 

Hope that helps. But just to reiterate, ""growth"" is far less guaranteed in this industry than most and ""burnout"" is often more common. Being a PA and finding a team that works consistently, and likes you/wants to bring you along immensely helps any prospects of growth.",comment_1,r/FilmIndustryLA,Entertainment,,https://www.reddit.com/r/FilmIndustryLA/comments/1kqf7uv/whats_career_trajectory_for_production_assistant/

"No one is being honest with you about what a Set PA does, so Set PA's typically are Locations PA's until you can work into another dept (it's different per country and even states/provinces within the country).

If there's bad weather like rain or snow it's the location teams job to ensure that the outdoor spaces or inside are usable for this, so laying down different types of surfaces to cover ice, puddles, mud - putting gravel out, setting up heaters or AC, cleaning floors if needed. There's also closing up roads and traffic control, locking up sets (ensuring people don't walk into frame, etc). Sometimes there are stationary bathrooms and it's your job to clean them and stock them. You are not assisting anyone creatively- and most of the time you are barely involved. It will likely take you years to get to these other PA positions.

"There are 3 things any of us wants in a job. You have to offer at least one of them:

1) Money.  
2) Opportunity.  
3) The experience.

If you're paying ""very low day rates"" then obviously it's not money that you'll be offering. If you're a micro budget 7-day feature, then odds are you aren't really offering anyone an opportunity either. So that leaves the experience.

Feed people well. Respect their time. Don't try to squeeze them for everything they're worth and don't try to continually push the envelope asking for overtime and grace before meals, etc. Make it a good experience and that'll be enough to attract a solid crew.",comment_5,r/FilmIndustryLA,Entertainment,,https://www.reddit.com/r/FilmIndustryLA/comments/1kob7c1/question_for_crew/
"Jumping from shorts to features - looking for guidance Hi everyone,

I’ve been writing and directing shorts for about 10 years now. Funding them through my career in post production (advertising). I just finished a pretty big short that I’m pasting a private link to below and I’m making the jump to a feature next. 

https://vimeo.com/1084285426
Password: ffreddit

Like I said, I’ve written and directed everything I’ve done but I think my writing is limiting my directing. My plan right now is I have a couple outlines of features that feel tight and have a low budget. At the moment I don’t know any feature screenwriters that I feel comfortable collaborating with so my thinking is to parallel path looking for a screenwriter while also picking one of the outlines and writing it myself. I wouldn’t even mind if I wrote it and then someone came and took it and made it their own and took the writing credit. My goal is to direct and if writing the first draft gets me there then so be it.

But I feel like what I need guidance with is meeting people. Screenwriters and producers. I know a ton of people in advertising. Every big agency in LA. But I know next to nobody on the business side of feature/tv. And my frustration over the years has been that LA doesn’t feel like it has a community for this. There is this chasm between the film independent industry mixers and the actually events where you actually get to meet people on a social level that later could throw you a bone for career.

I think that if you look at my website and you look at my work, you see that I execute. I say what I’m going to do and I do it. And I’m just looking for someone who’s a screenwriter wanting to get their script made or a producer looking for a feature to jump onto to see that I’m clearly not going to waste your time. We’ll make a movie one way or another.

And idk if this subreddit is made up of the film independent green mixer event people or the people who are working in the industry but I’m open to any and all advice. 

I appreciate your time for reading this post and if you watched the short film I linked at the top, thank you. I hope you liked it!

"Rebecca Green of “Dear Producer” just talked about this a little on her recent newsletter. I’ll share her snippet of advice:

“The best advice I can give to those looking for a producer is to get an IMDbPro subscription and do your research. Make a list of the movies you’ve loved in the last 5+ years, look up the producers, and see what other movies they have worked on recently to determine if they align with your project. How can you determine if they align? Figure out what budget size the producer typically works within and if they collaborate with filmmakers at your experience level. Meaning, if a producer hasn’t worked with a first-time director in over a decade, chances are there is a reason why. Or if a producer has only produced big budget studio films, they probably aren’t going to be the right fit for your low budget indie.”

Also a good nugget she shared:

I also suggested sifting through recent festival programs, specifically the shorts programs if you are an emerging filmmaker, so that you can connect with producers working on your level. You can find email addresses on IMDB, message people on LinkedIn, send a DM via social media platforms, or approach a producer after a screening or industry event. We are easier to find than you think.",comment_1,r/FilmIndustryLA,Entertainment,,https://www.reddit.com/r/FilmIndustryLA/comments/1knqbr0/jumping_from_shorts_to_features_looking_for/
"I’m going to be real with you here and you might not like it. Features are an investment. Not a great one at the moment. It used to be my job to evaluate packages for features, including creative attachments. Looking at the content on your website and the short you posted here I don’t personally think you are someone ready to be invested into at that capacity yet by a company. Not trying to tear you down if you are 100% sure you can do it, but you don’t just write a first draft and get work as a director without substantially better work to back you up. You write a really good polished script and have amazing work that has done good highly relevant non fringe festival runs? Or did super well online? Ok. That’s good enough. 

Or just make stuff so good it wins relevant awards for advertising if you are good at that. 

That’s not to say you couldn’t get any money though. At the stage you are at your plan would probably look similar to the coen brothers for their first film. Just a bunch of random rich people investing which is hell to raise for. Hope it works out. maybe you have a killer feature concept that I don’t know about.

"Hi S,

Congrats on the leap of faith! I'm a long time crew member turned full time producer and is currently prepping for my third feature on my year 2 producer career.

"Rumor.  Comcast plans to shut down universal studios production facilities in California as well as its universal city walk in favor of expanding their theme park and becoming a major Disney competitor I heard through the grapevine through a mutual of mine who is connected to music(has his own band) and has connections to the entertainment industry(his nephew is dating the star of the new wizards of waverly place show) said that Comcast the owners of Universal wants to turn the entire universal studios property into theme park space only.  This would mean demolishing the sound stages and filming studios as well as closing Citywalk.   We see evidence in the closure of many citywalk locations while they are building a new fast and the furious coaster, demolishing a soundstage to build Super Nintendoland and building a massive 500 room hotel on the property.

If you're not OK with that, then entertainment might not be for you.

If you're trying to do it on the side while working at a ""real"" job, it will only take that much longer. Personally, I've never seen it happen. It's tough to make it even when you're giving 100%.

Yes, it's possible you could get lucky. You could get ""discovered"". But that's basically like saying your career plan is to win the lottery. It's technically possible, but highly unlikely.

"Talent being paid with an LLC - Payroll required? Scrappy indie producer here: 

For talent with LLC’s are producers required to have payroll for the payout?

You need workers comp for anyone who shows up on set. You also can’t expect any individuals to have WC through their LLC. 

For any LLC/scorps, myself included, I run through payroll via loan out. When you do that, the entity is covered under the WC policy that is provided by the payroll company.

"I can't speak for LLC's specifically, but I have an S-Corp and I would imagine loan-out payment is the same. I've received payment through payroll when I'm editing on a union show, and on smaller indie things I've also just received checks made out to my company. It's as  if you walked into a store where I sell ""editing"" and you wrote me a check for that service. It's on me to keep the books and report that income for the business's taxes.

I'd be skeptical about payroll companies saying what is a requirement, that's a fox-guarding-the-hen-house dynamic. I imagine that's where your skepticism is coming from

"Efficient Lighting Techniques in Pre-Production: When Less is More For the past weeks I've been posting quick, bite-size behind-the-scences insights on how I draw and design for games and film and other entertainment media, the response has been positive so I decided to keep doing it and share another one.

When communicating an idea visually, what you don't show is often just as important as what you show in your images. By adding just enough detail to give your audience a general idea of what you mean, instead of providing a highly polished presentation, you allow them to fill in the gaps and interpret the story in their way.

This approach can effectively leave things feeling ""unfinished,"" but in reality, it may be more beneficial than a fully polished, real-time, interactive, PBR-rendered, AI augmented version of the subject.

A lot can be done without doing much, Horror games can benefit from leaving areas in the dark, to make the player wonder about where the danger would come while saving computer resources; comics and cartoons can leave the brushstrokes loose and rhythmical, to emphasize movement even more.

These are a series of images I've done in my free time that remind me of that concept, and which I've done while keeping that in mind. Less is more.

"Prop Masters -- how do you source? So, it came to my attention recently that prop masters don't know they can rent CRT TVs. 

  
In the wake of the industry being the way it is, I opened up my small business prop studio out of my apartment. I'm normally a Background Designer for TV Animation, local 839, and after hardly having work for 2 years I found myself ass backwards into collecting, renting and repairing CRT TVs. I was already sourcing so many from selling them it only made sense to rent. 

So I put up some Facebook Marketplace ads. Luckily there was some good demand. And I started asking my customers, how did you find me? Their typical answer: ""I thought I would have to buy one. I didn't even know you could rent."" 

Which brings me to the post question, how do Prop Masters source? Do you have your go-to prop houses? Do you go to FaceBook Marketplace? What is your experience going to the major studios for props? 

TLDR:   
Own a small CRT TV prop business. Want to know how prop masters source so I can better make them known of my presence.

"Except for the stupid directors that don't know what each of us do, lol! Can't tell you how many times a director has bitched at me about curtains or area rugs they decided they didn't like the day of. I have had to school many of them regarding the differences between Props and Set Dec. Kind of irritating, frankly. This was my favorite demonstration:

Yuppie director wearing the yuppie uniform which included his cashmere V neck sweater casually draped around his neck. He was very upset about an area rug and wanted me to change it out. I asked someone to alert the set decorator and then I turned to him and said ""That sweater you're wearing? As you wear it, it is considered part of your ""costume"" which the costume designer is responsible for."" Then I took both sleeves of the sweater and pretended to choke him with it. ""When the sweater is used in this way, as a weapon, then this sweater becomes a ""prop"" which the property master is responsible for"". Then I took his sweater and threw it on the floor and said ""NOW your sweater is considered ""set decoration"" and that will be addressed by the set decorator"".

"Screenplay Breakdown — tag each element's FIRST or EVERY occurrence? I'm breaking down a feature screenplay (in Final Draft 13) and curious if it's customary to tag each element (props, special effects, wardrobe, etc.) once upon first mention only, at every single mention (even if it's 10 times in the same scene), or only first mention for each new scene?

I can see certain items getting called out each and every occurence to be redundant (e.g. special lighting gag), but something that requires extensive set up to execute needing literally every instance being identified.

Appreciate any wisdom for the best working practice 🙏",post,r/FilmIndustryLA,Entertainment,0.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/FilmIndustryLA/comments/1km027u/screenplay_breakdown_tag_each_elements_first_or/
"If I'm understanding correctly, you don't need to tag every mention of an element *within the same scene,* just the first time it's mentioned in every scene. At least if it's the same exact item appearing throughout, like set dressing, props, wardrobe, and the like.

However, if you had an SFX gag that happens multiple times in a scene and needs to be reset each time, then, yes, you should mark each instance down. Final Draft won't record an element multiple times in scene if it has the same name (it will only show up once on the breakdown sheet), so you'd have to name them something like ""SFX Gag 1"", ""SFX Gag 2"", etc.",comment_1,r/FilmIndustryLA,Entertainment,,https://www.reddit.com/r/FilmIndustryLA/comments/1km027u/screenplay_breakdown_tag_each_elements_first_or/
