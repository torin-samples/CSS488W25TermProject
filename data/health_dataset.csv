"Please check on your quiet friends. Seriously. I'm a college student in my 20s, and I've learned that the people who seem the most ""okay"" are often going through a lot silently. I‚Äôve had friends who were always the ‚Äúchill‚Äù ones, the quiet ones who never complained or made a fuss. And then one day they just‚Ä¶ break. Or disappear. It‚Äôs heartbreaking.

Mental health doesn‚Äôt always look loud. It‚Äôs not always crying in class or having panic attacks. Sometimes it‚Äôs canceling plans with no explanation. Or slowly texting less. Or laughing and smiling but looking kinda empty in their eyes. Or just saying ‚ÄúI‚Äôm tired‚Äù all the time.

If someone crosses your mind, reach out. **A simple ‚Äúhow are you really?‚Äù** can mean more than you think.

"       ***caution***
***trigger warning***


Just to put my $0.02 in. I'm one of those quiet ones. I have ""attempted"" more times than I care to admit because my brain doesn't like me. Almost succeeded 3. But that was years ago. I'm carefully medicated now. Even afterwards though, nobody asked. Ever. Nobody said boo in fact. Quite the opposite. Everyone looked away like I somehow showed up naked at a family reunion. They saw me manic and they can only look away now. Shame? Anyway, in every one of those situations, (preferably before I go off the deep end) if someone actually said. ""No really, how are you really doing?"" (AND waited for the answer) It would've saved thousands in hospital bills, court fees, impound fees, lawyer fees, psych fees, fees, fees, fees, etc. And my body wouldn't have gone through the chemicals, the razor blades, the pills, the drugs. I would owe that person my life. 

I'm as okay as I'll ever be now. I'm not actively seeking an end at least. OP is right. Check on your friends and listen. You might only make a friend, but you could be saving a life. I'll go back to being quiet again.",comment_1,r/mentalhealth,Health,,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1l02onw/please_check_on_your_quiet_friends_seriously/

"i found a photo on his phone and it‚Äôs been messing with my head all week i was on my boyfriend‚Äôs phone a few days ago, just sending myself some pictures we took together, and i accidentally opened his hidden album (well maybe not so accidentally, im nosy). he‚Äôs shown it to me before so i didn‚Äôt think it‚Äôd be a big deal... just old stuff, screenshots, and photos of us. but this time i saw something new.

a photo of his ex. really posed, really flattering, clearly recent. i don‚Äôt think he took it, it looked like something saved from social media. but still. why save it? why keep it hidden?

i haven‚Äôt brought it up because i keep second-guessing myself. maybe i‚Äôm overthinking it, maybe it doesn‚Äôt mean anything‚Ä¶ but my brain won‚Äôt stop spinning. it‚Äôs been sitting in the back of my mind constantly, making me question everything. and now i feel anxious all the time around him.

i keep telling myself to just let it go but it‚Äôs eating at my self-esteem. i‚Äôve worked so hard to feel secure in this relationship and now i feel like i‚Äôm back at square one. i feel small. stupid. like maybe i‚Äôm not enough.

But you are right, the problem is that it's hidden, but the 2nd problem is you went snooping to find it.

"My girlfriend can‚Äôt get out of bed in the morning. She says sleep is her escape. I want to help - but I‚Äôm starting to drown. Hi everyone  
My girlfriend (22) has an extremely hard time getting out of bed in the morning. Not just hitting snooze - I mean literally unable to get up. She wakes partially, responds, but drifts back again and again.

This morning, we planned to wake up at 10am. It was 12:30 and she was still in bed. I tried a lot: made her chamomile for her swollen eyes (from dust allergies), gave her eye pads, brought her water (she barely drinks), played soft music - but she turned it off, pushed the water away, and fell back asleep.

Eventually she stirred a bit. I asked if she was still tired - she nodded. I said ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know what to do anymore,‚Äù and she just shrugged with a ‚Äúno idea‚Äù expression and went back to sleep.

But here's the thing: she *knows* something‚Äôs wrong. She‚Äôs told me she thinks she‚Äôs addicted to sleep - that it‚Äôs the only thing that feels good anymore. That she sleeps to avoid the stress of studying. That waking up means facing guilt, emptiness, and fog.

In her own words:

""There‚Äôs nothing to wake up for.""  
""It feels like magnets are holding me down.""  
""It‚Äôs not laziness. I know I can work hard - but I need someone or something to make me do it.""

Sometimes later in the day, she‚Äôll say ‚Äúwhy didn‚Äôt you wake me up?‚Äù or ‚Äúyou know what works.‚Äù But the truth is‚Ä¶ nothing consistently works. Whether she wakes up quickly or not at all seems totally random.

She once told me what I should *not* do when trying to wake her - don‚Äôt raise my voice (I never have), don‚Äôt touch or cuddle her (it makes her want to fall deeper asleep). She said I should try talking to her calmly, ‚Äúgentle parenting style,‚Äù maybe make her tea. I‚Äôve done all that, multiple times. Still, some days she gets up right away - and other days, like today, nothing works.

She‚Äôs not lazy. She‚Äôs someone who‚Äôs mentally burnt out, numb, and stuck in a loop of avoidance. And I love her - I really do. But I feel so lost. I want to help her, not enable the cycle. I don‚Äôt want to push her, but I also can‚Äôt just let her sink.

And I struggle too - with indecision, motivation, and not knowing what the ‚Äúright move‚Äù is. I try everything - softly, gently, lovingly - and sometimes it feels like it all just slips away.

**Okay so, my question is:**  
Has anyone been in this situation - either as the one stuck in sleep, or the person next to them?  
How do you help someone without breaking yourself in the process?

Any advice, stories, or perspective would mean a lot.",post,r/mentalhealth,Health,195.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1kzudkr/my_girlfriend_cant_get_out_of_bed_in_the_morning/
"Especially the ""There‚Äôs nothing to wake up for."" makes it sound like your girlfriend is depressed. Perhaps you could together make an appointment with a therapist for her. As depression influences the mind, it probably is difficult to reason with her. What could potentially help is to stimulate physical activity. Try to get her out of the house for a walk or doing some exercise. 

I've struggled with similar symptoms as your partner and therapy is what helped me the most. However, I did not have a partner at that time so I'm not sure how you can best support her in this process. The fact that you're posting this means you care a lot. I think it's a balance of trying to be supportive but also not pushing her too much.

"I'm so sorry you and your girlfriend are going through this. You sound like a very supportive partner. :)

Out of curiosity, has she ever been tested for sleep apnea? Does she snore? My husband finds it next to impossible to get out of bed whenever he has a lot of apnea events at night. I could yell FIRE! and he'd still be sound asleep.

It does also sound like she might be experiencing some mental health issues. I cannot recommend therapy (and if needed, meds) enough. A good psychiatrist and the right meds turned my life around. There's absolutely nothing to be ashamed of when it comes to seeking help, and services like Talkiatry make it SO easy.

"Thanks so much for your kind message - I really appreciate it.

As far as I know, she hasn‚Äôt been tested for sleep apnea, but we‚Äôll definitely look into it now. I don‚Äôt think she snores, but she does have ongoing issues with sleep - she‚Äôs told me several times that it can take her 2‚Äì3 hours just to fall asleep at night.

Before we met, she actually went to a sleep specialist about it. From what she told me, they asked her to track everything for two weeks: when she went to bed, when she got up, when the fatigue hit hardest, etc.  
But after that, nothing really happened. They said they didn‚Äôt have enough data yet and asked her to keep logging. After waiting and trying for a month, she just gave up - she felt like nothing was moving forward and that no real help was coming.

So yeah, this has been going on for a while. And your suggestion reminded me that maybe it‚Äôs time to revisit this, especially with a more proactive specialist",comment_4,r/mentalhealth,Health,,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1kzudkr/my_girlfriend_cant_get_out_of_bed_in_the_morning/

"I‚Äôm Here to Listen For Free Hi everyone,

I just wanted to put this out there: I‚Äôm here if you need someone to talk to. No catch, no judgment just a genuine ear to listen.

I believe that some of the most important things in life love, compassion, empathy were given to us freely. And I think it‚Äôs only right to pass that on.

Sometimes it‚Äôs hard to open up to friends or family. Others can‚Äôt afford a therapist If that‚Äôs you, and you‚Äôre carrying something heavy, I‚Äôm here. You don‚Äôt have to go through it alone. Just message me.

Of course, I can‚Äôt listen to anything illegal or harmful, and I ask that we keep things kind and respectful. But if you‚Äôre struggling, venting, or just feeling lonely I‚Äôve got time, and I care.

"I relate to this more than I‚Äôd like to admit , living in constant ‚Äúwhat if‚Äù mode is exhausting. Your mind is trying to protect you from pain by expecting the worst, but in doing that, it steals peace from the moments that are actually good. It‚Äôs survival mode, not living.
The hardest part is that it feels like this mindset is helping ? like if you‚Äôre ready for disaster, it won‚Äôt hurt as much. But pain doesn‚Äôt care how prepared you are. What this mindset does is burn you out and block real joy.
You deserve to feel safe while things are going well ,not just brace for when they end. Let yourself breathe.

"There is a good book called ‚Äúno bad parts‚Äù. It has really helped me. 

There is a part of you that is telling you that it needs to protect you from danger and the way it will help you do this is by looking very sexual and having people desire you. (Probably to save you from loneliness, sadness, some version of that). 

The only way to free yourself from that protector is to give it compassion, give yourself compassion. And accept it- then you can ask it if it would be ok to stand down a little and let you dress for yosuelf and your own gaze sometimes, not just for others. 

It‚Äôs a process. The audiobook is really good and has exercises and I got it for free on my local library app. Maybe you can too. Good luck.

‚Ä¢ PCOS that I self-diagnosed at 16 because I had telltale symptoms, but multiple people dismissed it and refused to check properly until I pushed for more tests at 18

‚Ä¢ a chronic pain condition that I was told was period pain from when I was 13/14 until I was hospitalised for it at 20 (despite multiple things triggering it, I was ignored), with minimal investigation since and specialists passing the buck for years without even trying to help or referring me to someone who would, so we still don‚Äôt know what it is and my pain meds (two types of oxycodone and paracetamol) have been unreliable in their effectiveness since before Covid, but they haven‚Äôt got anything stronger that they feel would help

‚Ä¢ repetitive kidney stones that cause pain & I was told several times that kidney stones don‚Äôt cause pain until they‚Äôre stuck, so I had to point out that I‚Äôve had kidney stones every time I‚Äôve asked for scans because of the kidney pain (maybe my body is more aware of pain because of the chronic pain condition, but it‚Äôs infuriating to be told kidney stones don‚Äôt cause pain when I am literally experiencing kidney pain because of the stones

‚Ä¢ ED behaviours that never got diagnosed because I‚Äôm plus-size and never lost significant weight, so they basically didn‚Äôt believe me and I‚Äôve struggled with it alone since I was a child

I‚Äôve been dismissed/ignored countless times (I‚Äôm 29 and still take my mum so she can verify what I‚Äôm saying when they try to dismiss me). Sometimes they‚Äôve tried to pass it off as linked to my mental health issues (I daren‚Äôt tell them I‚Äôm awaiting autism and ADHD assessments; the last thing I need is them to use that as another excuse to doubt me).

"Spiraling and don‚Äôt know how to fix it Im going through a tough spot of depression and anxiety. It feels like I‚Äôm spiraling of negative thoughts and emotions and theres zero lines to grab onto. Ive been through this exact feeling before and i honestly don‚Äôt know how i escaped it the first time.

It feels like there is zero meaning in life or anything that I do. Time feels distorted for me. Things that just happened earlier feels like they happened ages ago. 

I recently got a new job, well paying, nobody on top of me, literally the best job i could get even entry level for my skill set. I don‚Äôt want to quit before my first full week, and i honestly don‚Äôt know how I have managed to get through the first 3 days. Every moment feels like if i am blindfolded and walking forward hoping theres another step. Even though ive walked so much already its hard to trust there will be a step the next moment. It just feels like my thoughts are disconnected even though i can tell you everything i did throughout the day.

My parents already know about my mental health, and they were with me through my first battle of depression and i thank them for it. Ive told them about this recent issue and i can see them worried for me which i wish wasn‚Äôt the case. Today they took me out to get new clothes for my job, and hang out as a family just so im not locked in my room all day.

If there was an option to simply vanish from existence everyone forget about me and not have to worry about me anymore i feel like i would take it.

I am not suicidal, i actually fear death.

I wish to feel normal again, to be able to enjoy life. I envy the people that can enjoy life without a worry.

The only break i have from these thoughts are when i am asleep, if I even fall asleep because it feels like my mind is racing even in bed.

I also have a really bad problem with identifying my sexuality I watch straight and gay porn, both do turn me on yet I've only exclusively had sex with women only, I don't know if I'm actually bisexual or if I'm just addicted to porn so much that I need more stuff to spice it up or something. Also I still have confidence I'm not fat or obese in any way. I'm skinny fat if anything. That's mainly because of the drink and because of that my want to go to the gym has skyrocketed. I just can't seem to genuinely improve myself. I am attractive to women not all women but still enough to make me feeling somewhat satisfied I guess, and I'm also very distinct in the fact that I will not go for a woman if I'm not attracted to her.

I mentally and physically just can't go for someone if they're not attractive to me. My heart's not in it. I do feel that that if really improve myself I'll find a better women suited for me.

2. I‚Äôve lost all my money I‚Äôve saved up. My brother had an accident and I needed to pay for the medical bills and more.

"I started vaping to cope with anxiety and depression. Now I want to stop. Hi all. I hope this is the right place to post this (sorry if not, I've never posted before and this has taken a huge amount of courage).

A few years ago at Uni I took up vaping to cope with the stress of exams and the loneliness I was feeling at the time.

At the time I started vaping, I initially only did It for about three months and then stopped. Unfortunately, about a year ago I picked up the vape again because I'm in a VERY traumatic and stressful job, and had other things going on in my personal life too. Ever since, I have felt shame, guilt and hatred for myself. I made my mother quit smoking when I was younger and I feel that I now completely betray both her and I. The worst part is that I am lying to everyone in my life - no one knows I vape and whilst I was able to vape only when I was out of the house at first, I now find myself hiding around the house to vape.

For work I also need to be fairly fit, and whilst I am fitter than I have ever been before, I just know that I could be so much further into my fitness journey if I didn't vape.

Recently, I went on holiday for 10 days out of the country and I didn't vape once, which made me feel amazing. I didn't even experience anything that I would associated with nicotine withdrawal and I felt so much clearer than I have in a long time. I thought it was all over, I thought I had finally put the vape down but as soon as I got the chance upon my return home I bought another vape. Now I'm being plagued by headaches that the vaping causes and I'm disappointed in myself. 

Any idea how I can improve on my self-discipline and quit vaping once and for all?",post,r/mentalhealth,Health,2.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1l0cs5j/i_started_vaping_to_cope_with_anxiety_and/

"Laziness will ruin my life. (19yo, no job, no IRL friends)

I'm too lazy for everything. I do all the things people like me usually do: procrastinate, distract myself with movies, gaming, YouTube, just rotting away. I feel like a total waste when I see people my age forming their lives while mine is completely stuck.

I've been aware of this problem for years, and I‚Äôve always hated myself because of it. I remember having suicidal thoughts as early as 11, just because I couldn‚Äôt finish my homework on time. That feeling stuck with me. Some years I did more in high school, other years I did almost nothing. The last two years were slightly better because my teachers let me pass more often, but I honestly think they either gave up on me or assumed I had some kind of mental disability. And honestly, sometimes I think the same.

This year, I started an art-focused career path, but it just wasn‚Äôt for me, so I dropped out. I‚Äôve spent this whole year doing nothing. I should‚Äôve applied for a job or at least finished the two subjects I need to get my high school diploma. School doesn't feel too far out of reach, but the idea of getting a job and going to an interview feels like hell. I‚Äôve never been to therapy, so I don‚Äôt have an official diagnosis, but when I have to talk to new people or be in important situations, I get so nervous it feels like my heart‚Äôs going to explode. In a job interview, I‚Äôd probably crash completely.

I didn‚Äôt have any friends in high school until last year, but I couldn‚Äôt keep them. Writing this almost makes me cry because they might think I didn‚Äôt care about them. I didn‚Äôt text them much, and I probably came off as apathetic in person, but I really did care about them. I just didn‚Äôt know how to express it. Now I only have a few online friends.

I‚Äôve read a lot about motivation being the key, but I don‚Äôt know how it actually works for me. I remember getting super focused when I was doing 3D modeling and game modding, that kind of stuff. But when it comes to useful things like school or a job, even the smallest effort feels overwhelming. And now, I don‚Äôt even feel motivated for the ‚Äúuseless‚Äù stuff. As I write this, I was thinking of doing YouTube video, something I really want to do but I just can‚Äôt get myself to do it.

And to add another layer, I‚Äôve started to wonder if I ever really wanted to be a man. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll transition anytime soon because of everything I‚Äôve already said and don't want to add even more concerns to my parents, but it makes me question whether my insecurities are rooted in never truly having been myself. (I‚Äôll probably ask about this in more detail on r/MtF.)

The worst part of all this is that I‚Äôve read a ton of people going through similar struggles, and I‚Äôve seen a lot of helpful advice, but I still can‚Äôt act on it. I feel like I‚Äôm too lazy for life. My parents don‚Äôt seem to care much, but I‚Äôm dying inside. I‚Äôve never told them about any of this, not even a little bit. I don‚Äôt know how to talk to them. I‚Äôve never talked about these things with anyone face-to-face, and maybe because I already know what they‚Äôd say: ‚ÄúJust do it. Get a job.‚Äù But again‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm too lazy.

Thank you so much for reading all of this, even if you don‚Äôt comment.

It this is a stupid answer I‚Äôm sorry, questions confusing. 

But a physiologically answer is eating food reduces cortisol levels (stress hormone) and increases serotonin (happy hormones) which might also answer your question. 

Basically, humans are wired to not be stressed when they eat because eating = safe and also release happy hormones when they eat because food = reward.

"A part of me dislikes my parents for creating me I know this sounds very teen angsty, and I'm middle aged so I've no right to be. But I don't mean it that way. I have cordial relations with my parents and in fact tomorrow I am building a shed for my mum.

But I am someone who considers it wrong to bring life - including animal life - into being. My parents were selfish and naive and should have never procreated. There is no reason for me to exist and my existence has no purpose or value. Life has just been one drawn out disappointment, a steep decline into sickness, boredom and stress, since the short lived innocence of childhood. And my parents are, ultimately, responsible for that. 

I am antinatalist and have been for most of my life but not for child free reasons, but because I believe life to be a fundamentally negative phenomenon. I read thinkers like Schopenhauer in my youth. So it is lost on me why anyone would choose to pass it on when we can all see clearly how shit human life is. 

I feel like having a conversation with my parents as to why they created me and whether they considered the consequences. I don't think they have any answers. I'm not sure it will achieve anything. But yes, a part of me dislikes them both, but not in an angry or accusatory sense.

"What is the reason to live, why is death scary? Death is the end. But when you think about death, you think about how painful it must be and mostly about how you're loved ones will react. But it doesn't matter. You're in your own conscience and basically your own universe, if you die the world won't go on. The universe will close. You won't get to think about how you're family is doing when you die. You can't think it's over. There is no more family. People think that if they die the world will continue as it was and you'll just go outside it watching. But it won't the world won't continue. Like if I died it wouldn't be like reaching the end of the story or a movie. When those end it's worse than actually dying if you think about it. After a good movie ends you think damn that was a good movie and now it's over but when your die you can't think anymore you can't think about how good your life was now that it ended, your consciousness just fizzles.

Now tell me why you should be scared of death if you will feel nothing when it happens it'll just happen and you just stop thinking. Pain I feel is much more worse than death.

"You're not a robot. You're a human being confronting the weight of expectations, pressure, and unmet ideals. That pain you're describing, that hatred toward yourself, isn't the truth of who you are. It's the voice of a perception that‚Äôs lost sight of balance. It‚Äôs what happens when you judge yourself by an impossible standard, without honoring the other side of your story.

You say you've wasted your life, but you're not seeing what you've been building. Every moment of pain you've endured, every effort you've made to keep going, even this moment of venting, is evidence that there's something inside you that still cares. That still wants meaning. That still wants to matter. You wouldn't be hurting this much if you truly didn‚Äôt care. Maladaptive daydreaming isn't the enemy, it‚Äôs a signal. It‚Äôs your mind‚Äôs way of escaping a reality that feels out of alignment. The fantasy becomes addictive when your current life feels devoid of inspiration or autonomy. So ask yourself: what are those dreams giving you that your current life isn‚Äôt? Is it control? Is it freedom? Is it admiration, love, or significance? Whatever it is, you can‚Äôt shame yourself for wanting those things. You need to find a way to integrate them into your life, consciously and deliberately.

Hating yourself doesn‚Äôt serve anyone, especially not you. You're not broken; you're overwhelmed. You're not weak; you're overloaded. This pressure you're under, it's not here to destroy you. It's here to drive you inward, to make you question what you‚Äôre trying to be for others, and start choosing who you want to be for yourself.

You are not here by accident. You‚Äôre here with a purpose. And that purpose doesn‚Äôt require you to be superhuman. It requires you to be authentic. Strip away the expectations that aren‚Äôt yours. Stop trying to prove your worth through performance, and start aligning your life with what actually matters to you. Even the smallest step in that direction can start to rebuild your foundation. You haven't wasted your life. You're just being called to finally live it on your terms. Start now.",comment_4,r/mentalhealth,Health,,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1l021zf/i_wanna_give_up/

Over the past few years, I‚Äôve been dealing with serious health issues, including recurring knee problems that required surgery in 2022.

I work part-time at a play park, but that income doesn't cover my basic needs, let alone medical care. On top of that, I‚Äôve been living with undiagnosed ADHD, confirmed recently during a visit to a psychologist, but I haven‚Äôt been able to afford treatment. Coming from a culture where mental health is rarely acknowledged, it‚Äôs been an isolating experience.

Recently, my phone ‚Äî my only tool for learning and trying to rebuild online ‚Äî broke during a particularly bad anxiety episode. I dropped it and can‚Äôt afford to replace it.

Right now, I‚Äôm just stuck between survival and growth, and it‚Äôs hard.

If you‚Äôve been where I am, or if you have any advice, a kind words, or would like to support in any way ‚Äî I would be endlessly grateful. Even encouragement goes a really long way. Also if you have any tips on how i can deal with adhd or even cope with it please do share.

"18 years of hallucinations and sleep paralysis I'm a female 29 yo, chem eng and writter. I have had 9 psychologists, 1 psychiatrist and 1 psychoanalyst. That's the background.

I want to ask if anyone has had experienced the following and how did you overcome it: once I'm driffting to sleep, I feel shaking/vibration. weird noises/laughter/music, and as if something is lifting my legs out of the bed. Often, that happens while I'm sleeping already and I wake up paralized, scared and sweating like a pork on a slaughter.

It started when I was 11, my father said it was demons and performed an exorcism... I know, bs, didn't solve a thing. Sadly my parents were fanatic and neglected me in every way possible. I learned to keep my mouth shout and endure. But now I'm tired of this. I know it gets worst whenever I'm stressed out, I even had to quit my job since I couldn't get a decent night sleep for months and I was suffering a lot. I had psychiatric assistance too, with antidepressant, anxiolytic and antipsychotic meds, but it didn't help, the doctor changed my medication a lot and every adjustment caused me a lot of trouble, from headaches to explosive diarrh\*\*.  

My life is a mess, but I worked my ass off to be financially stable, so I can't complaint about having my need met even if I do nothing the whole day, but this keeps happening and  I am sure I will end up de-subscribing myself from existance.

I was early in recovery about 9 months. This was the first experience I had with a woman where the communication was 1000% from the get go. She was fresh from a toxic relationship so maybe I was her emotional fluffer idk but in my head I got pretty damn invested especially with the amount of time we had spent together.

To complicate things further, I suck at making friends. All friendships I've made have been through gradual happenstance, and I have antagonism toward associations and club like things, I even am everse to people connecting themselves to a hobby (i.e, 'I am a hiker; writer; gamer')-so for me, any friend I've ever had is a miracle. I definitely can't make friends at work, as being on the spectrum means socializing takes up a lot of energy, and I can't fall behind on my job

My friend group is going to blow up soon-I can't stop it. It hasn't happened yet, but there's going to be a line drawn soon. I want to become an introvert, just be productive in solo indeveours and live a life relatively strife free. Has anyone found some type of therapy or something to change your orientation in this way?",post,r/mentalhealth,Health,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1l0e037/can_you_learn_to_be_introverted/

"What you're describing is a deep and raw experience, but it‚Äôs not the end of your story. The very fact that you're still here, still asking for real advice, shows there's a part of you that knows there‚Äôs more than just suffering. That part of you, the part seeking a way to turn this around, is the key.

First, let‚Äôs get clear: no one is cursed. That belief is a perception you've reinforced over time, possibly because of repeated challenges that felt out of your control. When you're in a loop of pain, it's easy to create a narrative that says, this is just how life is for me. But that‚Äôs a subjective perception, not an objective truth.

Every human being experiences pain. What separates those who transform their lives from those who stay stuck is how they interpret and act upon that pain. Suffering becomes endless when it's not seen through the lens of meaning, growth, and contribution. The greatest people throughout history, those who left a legacy, didn‚Äôt escape suffering, they transformed it. They found the hidden order in the chaos. You can do the same. To begin, take inventory. Write down every major challenge you‚Äôve faced. Then, for each one, ask: What did I gain from this? What strengths did I develop? Who did I meet because of this? What have I been able to teach others as a result? This is not easy work. It takes brutal honesty and a willingness to stop seeing yourself as a victim of life, and start seeing yourself as a master in the making.

You don‚Äôt need to escape hell by fearing it after death, you need to stop creating it here through unresolved perceptions. The mind that believes it's cursed is the same mind that can liberate itself with clarity. Your life is not meant to be free of pain. It is meant to be rich in meaning. You‚Äôre not here to avoid hardship, you're here to rise through it and use it to serve others.

Start by finding where the greatest pain has already begun shaping the seeds of your greatest potential. Begin the work of transforming perception into power. That‚Äôs your responsibility and your path forward.",comment_1,r/mentalhealth,Health,,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1l04ivr/im_lost_dont_know_what_to_do/

"After Back Pain and Burnout, Nord Pilates Helped Me Feel Capable Again I work in tech and sit for 10‚Äì12 hours a day. Last year, I started getting really bad lower back pain. Not enough to need a doctor, but enough to affect sleep, mood, and even how I walked. I tried stretching videos, but nothing stuck ‚Äî and lifting at the gym felt risky.



That‚Äôs when I tried Nord Pilates ‚Äî mostly out of curiosity, partly out of desperation.



The first few sessions were humbling. Even the gentle movements activated muscles I didn‚Äôt know I had. But they were manageable. And more importantly: they worked.



What changed after 4 weeks:



My back pain reduced significantly (especially after their ‚Äúcore + posture‚Äù series)



I started sitting and standing differently ‚Äî taller, more balanced



I felt more in control of my body again



I actually craved the sessions ‚Äî they became my reset between work and evening



There‚Äôs also a mental calmness that comes from their audio sessions. No pressure, no push ‚Äî just movement and breath. I‚Äôve since tried their Cortisol Detox and Menopause guides (for my wife too) ‚Äî and they‚Äôve both made a noticeable impact.



We don‚Äôt talk enough about fitness being gentle. This was the first time I felt like movement healed me rather than punished me.



If you‚Äôre dealing with back pain or stress, I highly recommend giving Nord Pilates a try. Anyone else found relief through gentle training?",post,r/fitnessonline,Health,47.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/fitnessonline/comments/1kq922n/after_back_pain_and_burnout_nord_pilates_helped/

"How come when I microwave and heat up bananas to mash them, my stomach hurts. But if I eat them raw, I‚Äôm totally fine? I noticed this, twice it‚Äôs happened so I just stopped eating warmed mashed bananas, I just eat them raw now.

Is there some sort of molecule or something I‚Äôm creating that somehow doesn‚Äôt sit well?

It‚Äôs just strange because rice never had problems with any food, no allergies or intolerances or anything. It‚Äôs strange!",post,r/Dietandhealth,Health,2.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dietandhealth/comments/1kz8db0/how_come_when_i_microwave_and_heat_up_bananas_to/
"That's actually a really interesting observation‚Äîand you're not alone. While bananas are generally easy to digest when raw, heating them can cause some subtle changes that might affect certain people differently.


When you microwave bananas, a few things happen:


Sugars break down: Heating can increase the availability of simple sugars like fructose and glucose, which may cause digestive discomfort in some people, especially if you're sensitive to fructose.


Fiber softens and changes: Heat can alter the structure of banana fiber, possibly making it ferment faster in the gut‚Äîthis can lead to gas or discomfort in people sensitive to FODMAPs (a group of fermentable carbs).


Chemical changes: Heat may slightly alter the profile of certain compounds like polyphenols or create new byproducts during breakdown. While nothing toxic is formed, you could be reacting to one of these changes even if you're not ""allergic"" in the clinical sense.




It‚Äôs not that unusual for someone to be fine with raw foods but react oddly to them when cooked. You might just be uniquely sensitive to heated banana compounds‚Äîor even how fast your body processes them in that form. Since you're totally fine with them raw, it's smart that you just stick with that.

"Hey, you're not alone‚Äîthis is super common with kids that age. You're doing great just by wanting to help her improve. Here are some ideas and actual food examples:


Start small. Don‚Äôt cut her safe foods like pasta right away‚Äîjust try modifying slowly.


If she dislikes creamy textures and meat, go for alternatives with better textures:


Proteins: scrambled or boiled eggs, crispy tofu, hummus, peanut butter, baked beans


Carbs: rice, couscous, mini roasted potatoes, wholegrain pasta (start by mixing with regular)


Veggies: carrots, cucumber sticks, sweetcorn, crunchy bell peppers




Build from what she likes:


Pizza: try mini homemade pizzas on wholewheat wraps or pitta with tomato sauce + cheese + a tiny bit of veg


Chocolate spread sandwiches: gradually switch to softer wholegrain bread; add sliced banana or strawberries on top




Snack/breakfast ideas:


Toast with chocolate spread and peanut butter


Banana pancakes (egg + banana, mashed and pan-fried)


Smoothies with oat milk, berries, and a spoon of peanut butter


Cereal with fortified oat or almond milk


Apple slices with peanut butter or hummus




Tummy aches from pasta? Could be worth checking with a doctor or dietitian just in case (gluten sensitivity, etc.).


Let her help with shopping or cooking. Kids are more likely to try foods they helped choose or prepare.

"[Read this article](https://www.verywellfit.com/an-example-of-a-healthy-balanced-meal-plan-2506647). It also has a meal plan for ideas.
I think what you are aiming for is a balanced diet.
Try to not label foods as good and bad.
These terms can make you feel guilty for eating so called bad foods.
Some foods have more nutrients than others yes but moderation is key.


You do want to eat at least 3 cups of vegetables a day and 2 servings of fruit so work towards that.",comment_1,r/Dietandhealth,Health,,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dietandhealth/comments/1kwc98e/any_diets_that_are_similer_to_what_im_doing_to/
"Hi there,
My respectful response to your comment;
The bad thing you start with seems 'bad' to begin with, the fruit is ok, but only energy and sugar and barely more than that, then the veggies is no more than some energy and a tiny amount of nutrients if you're lucky. Easy to dismiss but you need to consider what's being sprayed over those fruit and veggies?!
I suggest starting with some red meat, fish or eggs. Then whenever you're hungry have as much red meat, fish eggs or dairy as you feel like. 
For sure put in some fruit or veggies here or there if you like them, seasonal def gets the best quality.
Skip the bad altogether, you'll get in an up cycle real quick!
Hope that's some help for you üòä",comment_2,r/Dietandhealth,Health,,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dietandhealth/comments/1kwc98e/any_diets_that_are_similer_to_what_im_doing_to/

"Built an app to be healthier. This is why I made it work Eating healthy is EXTREMELY challenging! (OMG!). Especially when our surroundings don‚Äôt help. When we have constant temptations of consuming processed food several times a day, how can we keep up?? It‚Äôs so hard!

I've struggled for years and years with my diet! Oh my gosh, it‚Äôs sooo hard to stay consistent! And even harder to know what's actually good for our health. Why is X or Y, Z, food good, okay, or not?? And how can I compare two meals or items to understand which one I should stick with?

That‚Äôs why, 2.5 years ago, I decided (with another nutritionist) to take a brutal and expensive decision that will turn our health to healthier habits for good!

We built a mind-blowing nutritional iOS app. My own diet has changed so much, by simply taking a snap each time I eat something! As of today, it has helped over a thousand people! This is such an incredible success! And this is just the very beginning! The app is super easy to use and gives clear breakdowns to stay on track.

"Low carb liquid diet, for the rest of my life. Need help figuring it out! So I have a very rare and serious health condition that affects my bowel, and means I have to keep 'fermenting foods' to a minimum. That's mostly carbs, like grain, but also some veg, legumes, etc.

I've been referred to a dietitian but unfortunately as it's on the NHS that will take a few weeks to get; maybe a couple of months even. I have been told to switch to a liquid diet in the mean time and have been blending my food, using a food processor.

From looking into it a bit, I think that I am looking for something akin to a keto diet - I think.

But the aim is to gain weight, or at least to have a diet that would make a normal person gain weight. Realistically I wont be eating all of the food and I will likely vomit some up and not absorb a lot of it, so I need to aim for 3000+ calories per day.

Please could somebody help me find a diet that fits these requirements? Honestly, my life could depend on it (if I got especially unlucky).

I will have to be on this diet permanently so I need to try and get all my nutrients with these strict limitations. It's a pain in the butt and so far I've been failing and my bowel is getting angry :c So i'm pretty desperate for some help, can anybody give me some recipes for meals that fit these requirements?

Although I don't have a copy of that, I was just sat with him when he sent the referral. 

If it helps me, I don't care if it tastes bad. Honestly I don't enjoy food anymore anyway, I think the fact it makes me feel nauseous and my bowel doesn't accept it properly means that I have zero appetite and things taste kind of bad for me. 

I appreciate your help, I will definitely go in this direction and speak to my dietician about this.

Yes you will certainly feel better if you eat healthier at that same calorie range. If you‚Äôre mainly eating junk food you‚Äôre likely not getting enough protein which could really affect your energy. Staying away from sugar can also help. I would recommend sticking to things such as rice and other grains for your carbs. Sugar provides a quick jolt and crash while healthy carbs give you a more consistent source of energy. If you mix in some weightlifting and cardio you can raise your metabolism which can allow you to stay skinny but eat more. Even just going on a 30 min walk outside every day will make a huge difference I promise. I‚Äôve been weightlifting for years and it is insane the impact it has on your metabolism. It has given me much more leeway with my diet. I would also recommend going to the doctor to get a blood test to see if you have any deficiencies that you could take care of with vitamins. Vitamin D is a likely one that you could be deficient in that would affect your energy. Also keep in mind that eating healthy is eating balanced. No need to go straight chicken and rice or anything you still need fat in your diet!,comment_1,r/Dietandhealth,Health,,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dietandhealth/comments/1kldd54/is_it_possible_to_stay_underweight_and_still_be/

"No not really, not to the extent you are.  Your body is telling you this.  Yes eating junk makes you feel like junk,  but this is just as much a result of your lack of calories and healthy body fat as your lack of nutrients. Women need a certain amount of body fat (higher than men) to have a healthy hormonal balance, and humans need a certain level of body fat to properly process certain nutrients. 

Healthy foods or not, if you add exercise to your current calorie intake you're also going to exacerbated the issue. More movement means higher calorie needs, if you're unable to function on what you're eating while sedentary you're not going to be able to do it with more movement. 

You need to eat healthy foods and stop tracking calories. Get help for your ED if you can before you do potentially permanent damage to your body",comment_3,r/Dietandhealth,Health,,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dietandhealth/comments/1kldd54/is_it_possible_to_stay_underweight_and_still_be/

We cut out sugar, not completely but mostly and more importantly seed/vegetable oils and products that have them in them, which is basically all packet/long shelf life stuff!
Anyway we both now do some exercise but nothing crazy, eat mostly meat, fish, eggs and dairy and have no issues whatsoever with being under or over weight, it's life changingly good!

For context, I am 6‚Äô2‚Äù, 210 lb at around 15 percent body fat and lift weights/run very regularly. Because of this, my metabolism is super high.

This has been going on ever since I started bulk/cut cycles a couple years ago. I have since stopped but now it feels like my relationship with food has been damaged.

"Other possibly reasons for fatigue around meals..

Insulin Sensitivity Issues:

Even if your blood tests are normal, you could have mild insulin resistance, causing post-meal fatigue. A glucose tolerance test (or wearing a continuous glucose monitor for a few weeks) could help identify this.

Autonomic Nervous System Imbalance:

Excessive bulking and cutting can sometimes dysregulate your autonomic nervous system, leading to poor transitions between sympathetic (active) and parasympathetic (rest) states, causing you to feel drained after eating.

Postprandial Hypotension:

This is a drop in blood pressure after eating, which can make you feel tired or lightheaded. It‚Äôs more common than people realize, especially in tall or athletic individuals.

Food Sensitivities or Intolerances:

Sometimes, fatigue after meals is a subtle sign of food sensitivities (e.g., gluten, dairy, or specific grains). An elimination diet might help identify triggers.

Mitochondrial Fatigue:

If your cells aren‚Äôt efficiently converting food to energy (ATP), you can feel wiped out even after eating plenty. This can sometimes be linked to chronic overtraining or nutrient deficiencies like CoQ10.

Hormonal Imbalances:

Chronic dieting and heavy training can sometimes throw off thyroid function or cortisol rhythms. Did your doctor check thyroid markers like TSH, T3, and T4?

Blood Flow Diversion (Splanchnic Circulation):

After eating, blood is redirected to your digestive system, which can cause fatigue if your body isn‚Äôt handling that transition smoothly.",comment_3,r/Dietandhealth,Health,,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dietandhealth/comments/1kl5v4c/diet_issues/

I am:
- Age: 30 years old
- Gender: Male
- Height: 168cm
- Current morning weight: 76.4

What I already did:
- Started the diet since April 17, I did a water only fasting for 4 days(obviously influenced by the docuseries of Chris Hemsworth's Limitless)
- After 4 days of water fasting I learned about that Peter Attia changed his views on water only fasting because of Muscle Atrophy
- I decided to do 16:8 instead consistently as long as I can
- After the 4 days water fasting I lost 6 kgs(82kg last I check then 76 on the 4th day), then when I get back on eating, my weight is consistent on 78.
- Last week, I started my training on 5k run with a Garmin Coach(Greg)
- I am a Filipino, with asian diet(rice, filipino foods, etc.)

"Ok so here are some options for all 3 meals that contain suitable amounts of each food group, you can find recipes online and portion to your liking. I‚Äôm a very big fan of getting 10g fibre per meal and 20g protein. 

- Chia pudding or overnight oats are great for meal prep, or you can combine the two for a balanced fibre/carb ratio. Adding greek yoghurt or protein powder to these can bulk them up with protein, and you can add fruit and honey for flavour (or whatever sweet options you like!). cereals and granolas shouldn‚Äôt be your overall go-to because a lot of the time they‚Äôre just sugary with little fibre in. Toast is good if coupled with beans , eggs , peanut butter - Just make sure to add more fibre to the meal (fruits high in fibre are raspberries and blackberries) 

- For lunch I‚Äôd say if you like salad , then salad is a great option for you. Leafy greens are great but you‚Äôre better of filling the salad with beans and legumes more than just vegetables - Maybe type in ‚Äúdense bean salad‚Äù on google and it‚Äôll have a great recipe that‚Äôll last you about 4/5 days. Sandwiches are great too with a protein filling , and you can keep your fibre on the side (some breads contain lots of fibre if you wanna have a look at those). 

- Dinner you can basically have anything as long as it fits your 10g fibre and 20g protein. Sometimes if you‚Äôve missed certain nutrients during the day, it‚Äôs easy to make them up during this meal. If you‚Äôre ever struggling to come up with a good dinner option , salmon with rice and broccoli is always a staple in my house! I cook the salmon in honey and chilli , fry some onion in the rice with some peas , and roast the broccoli next to the salmon. 

Hope this helps :) I you need anything else just lemme know.",comment_3,r/Dietandhealth,Health,,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dietandhealth/comments/1k3p41q/31m_help_creating_a_healthy_eating_plan/

"How do people not snack and not eat sweets Let me first say that I am at a healthy weight and do not eat a lot of sweets. But I love to eat.

"An app that helps you eating healthier Hey everyone, I just wanted to share something I've been working on for a while.¬†

I've built an iOS app called \*MealSnap\* that helps you log your meals and keep track of your calories, but I‚Äôve really tried to make it as simple and quick as possible. I‚Äôve gone through so many versions of it, and this latest versions (since v4) is built around a nutrition model I‚Äôve trained myself, called NutriAI.

The goal for me wasn‚Äôt to add a bunch of fancy features, but just to make something that gets the job done without wasting time. You log your meals (including drinks), it counts your calories automatically, and if your diet is looking a bit off or you're going over your daily limit, it gives you suggestions.. I've been using it myself daily and keep tweaking it, but I‚Äôd love to get feedback from others, especially people here who care about nutrition and healthy eating.

Now, would this kind of app help you stay on track with your diet? I know calorie tracking apps can sometimes be over-complicated or annoying to use.

If anyone wants to check it out, it's on the App Store here: [https://apps.apple.com/app/mealsnap-ai-food-log-tracker/id6475162854](https://apps.apple.com/app/mealsnap-ai-food-log-tracker/id6475162854) ¬†

"Guide me on my belly and face fat loss journey So I'm a 20 yr old female, and last year I started a weight gaining journey which obviously succeeded or I wouldn't be here. I weighted 49 kg before and today I weight 55kg or a little more. Not too much but I'm content with the results especially because I did not work out at all to get here. Most of the weight went to my legs and ass which is a good thing but obviously some of it made its way to my belly and what worries me the most: the face. I know I have to exercise now to keep my ass and slim my waist a little, but I just wondered what kind of foods I should be eating and what kind of diet I should do to help keep my ass and legs, slim my waist, slim my face, and also keep my stomach and face from bloating so much.

"When properly training for strength, you hold your breath through the entire rep for bracing. And you don't do very many reps per set, just 5. Strength training doesn't leave you out of breath for very long. I don't know if this is relevant to having asthma, but if getting out of breath from aerobic exercise is limiting you, strength training might not limit you in the same way.

The other thought is that going to the gym should not be comfortable. It does not feel good. It's a grind, it's work, and you feel uncomfortable when pushing yourself. Doing it right means you're in some kind of pain and discomfort at the gym. This especially includes mental discomfort. Pushing yourself is mentally painful, and sucks.

"2 weeks away from the gym won't make that much of a difference. You might feel a little rusty getting back to it or much stronger (because of the rest) depending on how hard you trained before the small break. Muscle breakdown is a very long process unless you're underfed, you barely hydrate and you don't sleep but I don't think that's the case. 

Btw your mind doesn't have to be in it for you to workout, it has to be a habit on autopilot that way it's not about how you feel (unmotivated 90% of the time like most people) but what you want to achieve long term.",comment_2,r/Workingout,Health,,https://www.reddit.com/r/Workingout/comments/1kyxc1e/missed_gym/

"Getting back into shape. Hello, I'm looking for some guidance. I haven't worked out in year. I use to be a swimmer and I use to do calisthenics regularly and work out with a kettle bell. 

Recently I started swimming again and would like to start doing some weight training. With my main goal of doing calisthenics regularly and kettle bell work outs again. 

I'm not sure if I can properly do pull ups, dips, and chin ups properly if not at all anymore. 

Would it be better to start off with weights on the machines before going back to those exercises or just try to increase my abilities doing those exercises? 

Any opinions or recommendations are appreciated

"Calories burned in a day?  am a 30 year old woman, 155 pounds, and live an active lifestyle. I work in a restaurant so I‚Äôm on my feet 8+ hours a day, where I‚Äôm also lifting trays of glassware, boxes, etc. I do a combination of Pilates, lagree, and barre 5 days a week. I‚Äôm not looking to necessarily lose weight, just tone muscle. I am curious though, about calories burned a day. A quick google search told me that the average woman should burn 1500-2k calories a day? That seems highly inaccurate to me for the AVERAGE person. Yesterday between my job and 45 minute barre class and walking to the train in between I burned 871 active calories. It seems physically impossible to burn 1500+ in a day without dedicating my life to exercise.

"Nord Pilates surprised me, here‚Äôs what low impact actually did for my consistency I used to think ‚Äúworking out‚Äù meant going hard, lifting heavy, pushing through HIIT circuits, and ending every session completely drained (sometimes in a good way, sometimes not). But after a long string of hectic workweeks and recovering from an injury last year, I needed something gentler, something that wouldn‚Äôt leave me limping the next day.

That‚Äôs when I started experimenting with low-impact routines and stumbled on the **Nord Pilates app**. It promised short, bodyweight-based sessions I could do from home. I figured I‚Äôd give it a shot, just 15 minutes a day, no equipment. Honestly, I expected it to be a placeholder until I could get back to ‚Äúreal workouts.‚Äù

But here‚Äôs what actually happened:

* I started doing it daily, *without* dreading it.
* My posture improved, I hadn‚Äôt realized how stiff I‚Äôd become just sitting all day.
* My core strength noticeably increased in a way I never quite hit with weights.
* My flexibility and mobility got way better, something I wasn‚Äôt even aiming for.

It didn‚Äôt feel like I was grinding, but my body still changed, just more gradually and in a sustainable way. These days, I use **Nord Pilates** on active recovery days, or I‚Äôll stack a session after some light strength training. It‚Äôs honestly helped me stay way more consistent than when I was relying on pure motivation.

I‚Äôm not saying it‚Äôs for everyone, but if you‚Äôve ever written off low-impact training as ‚Äúnot enough,‚Äù this app might surprise you like it did me.

"43 and I feel your pain. This year I have changed my approach to working out by splitting my work outs into leg cardio + upper body residence. The next day arm cardio+ leg resistance. 

When doing resistance lowered my weights considerably. For example bicep curls instead of 35 lbs as in my twenties I'm at 15-20lbs depending on what's free on the racks. I don't even count reps anymore. I push until exhaustion. Muscles shaking type last rep. Ya the burn is the new soreness I'm looking for.

Love and accomodate yourself, if you need to do low weight high reps to feel comfortable and that works for you(and it seems it is) then go for it

edit: 

High weight (1 - 5 rep range) is most effective for building strength but not as good at developing larger muscles.

Rep ranges from 6 - 30 ~ are the most effective for hypertrophy aka making your muscles larger, tapering off a little towards the high end but you can absolutely build muscle with 30, even 40 or 50 rep sets.

"Start taking collagen protein and those ligaments will get better. A necessity after 40.

I don't like skull crushers because of how my tendons feel after. I got up to 50lbs on those and they just wreak havoc on the ligaments in my elbows. Vbar loads my triceps but doesn't make my ligs sore. I do thumb over the top. 

As far as curls go use a straight barbell and when you get to the top, curl your wrists in and hinge up slightly. Really squeeze the bicep. You don't need a ton of weight for biceps, but you do need to make sure to squeeze it and work through it's full ROM. Cheat curls where you twist the db in toward your shoulder really get a good squeeze on the bicep as well.

I swear music can literally override fatigue. Personally, I‚Äôve had sessions where I legit only finished because the energy of the track pulled me through. Nothing hits harder than a song that knows exactly when to go off.

If you are legitimately counting calories and eating at a deficit on top of exercising and not losing any weight then I‚Äôd consult your doctor.

"Question about added muscle burning more calories in workouts Let's say I can do 80 pounds right now on a regular row machine (just arms) and in a year from now I've gained muscle to be able to pull 160. Will that workout burn twice as many calories? It will feel just as easy but the body is moving more load.

I've seen people talk about how increasing muscle and lean body mass will help increase BMR, but I'm try to understand how. I heard that muscle at rest only burns 10-15 extra calories per pound. (could be slightly higher or lower, I'm just pulling from memory)",post,r/Workingout,Health,2.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Workingout/comments/1kvhqlj/question_about_added_muscle_burning_more_calories/
"If you‚Äôre thinking of weight loss, muscles are glycolytic, they ‚Äúburn‚Äù (use) glucose, not fat. This is different if you‚Äôre in nutritional ketosis and fat adapted. I do not know the answer to your question directly, but if you‚Äôre hoping for more efficient weight loss with bigger muscles, you‚Äôre going to have a bad time¬†",comment_1,r/Workingout,Health,,https://www.reddit.com/r/Workingout/comments/1kvhqlj/question_about_added_muscle_burning_more_calories/
"It won't be 2x because muscles get more efficient as well as stronger ... but it will be *close to* 2x. As u/oil_fish23 noted, this will mostly be glucose burn rather than fat burn, but see below.

Resting muscle does burn more calories than most other resting body compositions, estimated as about 6 (kilo)calories per day per pound, vs 2 for fat tissue. So if you drop 10 lbs (number picked for roundness rather than practicality) of fat while adding 10 lbs of muscle, you'll burn about 40 calories per day more just by existing. That's about one Trader Joe's dark chocolate mint cream.

Note that muscle tissue can use both anaerobic and aerobic metabolic cycles, and lower-rate use (such as what your breathing muscles do, or what happens when you walk long distances) taps into the aerobic cycle as it's slower but much more efficient. In fact, breathing makes up a lot of your BMR usage (the calories you'd burn if you were in a coma). Of course BMR is pretty small, especially compared to total energy expenditure if you're active (do a lot of walking for instance).

Last, an interesting note about going into ketosis (by avoiding carbohydrate intake): once you're actually in the ketosis state, the body ""wastes"" roughly 2 calories per gram of fat to produce the ketones that substitute for glucose. So instead of getting an average of about 9 calories per gram of fat, you get an average of about 7 (same as the calories per gram for alcohol).",comment_2,r/Workingout,Health,,https://www.reddit.com/r/Workingout/comments/1kvhqlj/question_about_added_muscle_burning_more_calories/
While lifting heavier loads demand more muscle demand so that does burn more calories . But it doesn't scale linearly .

You're 50, you're not inept and feeble. You don't need to sit in a chair when you exercise. It's worrying that looked appealing to you. You need to be strengthening your core, legs, back, spinal erectors, arms.

Strength is how much force you can produce against an external resistance. Walking and moving your limbs while sitting in a chair does almost nothing for strength.

For my cut, I will be switching from high weight low rep to low weight high rep with more cardio incorporated. I will be eating just below my maintenance calorie level. MY question is, what strength training movements do you guys consider essential for each muscle group? My bulking workouts are dialed in, but I would like to elimate some movements while I'm cutting to make time for more cardio. Which movements would be essential for maintaining mass?

"Hi it is good fo hear you wanna lose weight and workout sadly there is no shortcut for losing weight there are supplements like green tea and cafeine wich help losing weight but both give very limiting effects were as cafeine can give you energy to do cardio or weight lifting thus increasing your activity making you burn more calories so cafeine can be worth it but also don't take tomuch.

 And like i said there is truly no shortcut for losing weight when i say this i mean if you are gona fast for a long period of time while exercising you might lose alot of weight but the weight will not only be fat the end goal should be body fat,
 it might be a good idea to have it tested and make an appointment to test it again so you have something to strive you should also not do anything expensive you can buy skinfold caliper yourself that is not to expensive and have someone you know do it. 

And remember consistency is key.

Maybe:

This would give you about a week between working the same muscle again which will hopefully give it some time to recover.

"Unless she really enjoys body part splits or something, I generally don‚Äôt see a strong reason to do them. Hitting your muscles at least twice a week is probably at least marginally better than hitting them once per week. So id probably consider something more in the realm of full body or upper lower (and you can throw in an extra cardio day if you want regardless). If 3 day, I‚Äôd probably opt for full body or FBxUL, if 4 days a week I‚Äôd probably just opt for ULUL. That said at the end of the day splits just aren‚Äôt that important, you can make a ton of progress on most any split.

From your post I have no idea what volume she‚Äôs accustomed to, or if she is accustomed to training close to failure, or what equipment you have available to you. I‚Äôd suggest starting conservative on volume (maybe 6-8 sets per muscle group with sets taken to 0-2RIR depending on the exercise and rep range). Focus on technique and intensity. If/when she plateaus then maybe experiment with increasing volume.

If she‚Äôs ok with it, I‚Äôd think about including compound pressing movements that don‚Äôt utilize chest (stuff like overhead press and JM press) so you still get the efficiency of a compound movement for front delts and triceps. Don‚Äôt neglect the side delts, they‚Äôre important for an hourglass figure (assuming that‚Äôs a body shape she finds desirable).

Making one of the days a glute focused lower makes sense. Glutes get hit pretty well by the big compounds: deep squats, RDLs, good mornings, lunges etc all of which can be tweaked to favor the glutes. An isolation lift or two is fine to include like a hip thrust or some kind of abduction exercise for the glute medius.",comment_1,r/WorkoutRoutines,Health,,https://www.reddit.com/r/WorkoutRoutines/comments/1l06bnv/creating_a_routine_without_incorporating_chest/

"You should probably listen to experts rather than random people on the internet. Recomposition and bulking are not opposites. Both focus on building muscle. With recomposition, you attempt to build muscle without gaining weight by eating at maintenance calories while exercising.  With bulking, you gain muscle and gain weight by eating above maintenance and exercising.  

75kg is a good weight for your height. But you have a body fat percentage of well over 20%. That isn't very good. You need much more muscle. If you can gain the muscle while losing fat (recomp) that would be best. If you can't (for example, if you feel super low on energy), then eat more and just gain the muscle without losing the fat. You can cut later after you have gained 15-20 pounds of muscle. That will probably take at least 2 years of consistent effort.",comment_4,r/WorkoutRoutines,Health,,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1kznuxh

"Is my workout routine effective for building muscle and maintaining cardio fitness? My main goal for working out is to remain independent and free of preventable diseases for as long as possible (I work in a nursing home and many of my patients are bedbound, very sick etc, gives me a lot of motivation to workout lol). I was talking to my husband the other day about my workout routine and he says it is a strange way to workout. I usually do strength training with 17-20 jumping jacks in between, and I make sure my heart rate is in zone 2 or higher the whole workout. I do all my exercises one time before moving onto the next circuit. So it‚Äôs like:

Bicep curl 
Overhead presses 
Weighted squats 
Tricep extension 
Hamstring curls 
Bent over rows 
Box squats 
Pushups 
Curtsey lunges 
Weighted toe touches 
Tricep dips 
Front raises 
Kas variant hip thrust 
Hammer curls 
Hip thrust 
Shoulder shrugs

With the 17-20 jumping jacks in between and going until failure on the sets. And then I do all that 2 more times, no breaks. I‚Äôve managed to built some muscle since I started 9 months ago but I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôm not optimizing growth this way since I take no breaks‚Ä¶ and since my heart rate is in zone 2 half the time and zone 3 the other half, I was hoping it counted as cardio. I can‚Äôt do regular running/jogging because it flares up my restless leg syndrome unfortunately.

"I'd add a deadlift with moderate weight for back health. Most people online seem to think (and I kinda agree) that front raises are not needed if you already do an overhead press. You're missing a vertical back pull, like pull-ups or cable pull downs. Also some calf raises to strengthen your feet/ankles. Finally I'm also into working out for health; my idol is that 90-yo grandma who works out with her 2lb dumbells on tiktok, I want to be her when I grow up (I'm a dude).

"Starting point is that you're clearly challenging yourself and feeling better for it, so the only reason to change is if you *want* to. That said, your program is kind of... confused. Cardio and muscular strength are both important metrics, but trying to get both indiscriminately in a single workout is doomed to produce suboptimal results. Sticking jumping jacks between every set can *only* trick you into thinking that you are working to max effort on your lifts when in fact you are merely limited by your cardio fitness.


A better strategy:

- pick a lower impact cardio routine that doesn't trigger your RLS like an elliptical or just walking on an inclined treadmill. Make this a more coherent and independent part of your routine, like 15 or 20 minutes at the start of your workout but not between sets.

- don't do a big ""circuit""; start an exercise, do 3-5 sets with a short rest in between, then move on. *Don't* try to stay in zone 2! Let your heart rate drop until you feel strong for your next set.

- consider adding a big compound or three, if your biggest concern is longevity and strength into old age. The best candidates would be deadlifts [incomparable stimulation for the central nervous system and entire posterior chain] and heavy farmer walks [functional core and distributed upper body strength].",comment_2,r/WorkoutRoutines,Health,,https://www.reddit.com/r/WorkoutRoutines/comments/1kzm6d7/is_my_workout_routine_effective_for_building/

"Should I do cardio days? 

For a while a weekly football practices was giving me all the cardio a need, this has stopped now and I'm looking for alternatives.

For context I'm M34 230 lbs 30%BF. My target is to get to >20% BF. I left weights 3 times a week for 2 years now and lost tons of weight in the process.

With the football gone I need to add cardio to my routine. I have tried to add 1 minute cardio sessions in between sets, like I would do kettle bell swings, walking lunges dumbbell clean and jerk etc. but that seems to affect my ability to lift for my main workout. I'd say by doing that I'm limited to 70% of what I normally lift.

Is that a bad thing, since it's impacting the intensity of my main workout should I stop it, or is it supplementing it in a way to that serves my target (lower BF).

So globally I‚Äôd recommend per week :
Session 1 - 15min heat + 1x5000m
Session 2 - 5min heat + 1x10.000m
Session 3 - 10min heat + 8x500m / 2min rest

"20 month journey Started the workout journey in October 2023, after losing about 15lbs from strictly doing cardio. I was pretty consistent with lifting, less consistent with diet/protein intake. Saw some good gains, but eventually ended up getting lazy, we‚Äôll call it accidental bulking for about 7 months.

Fast forward to January 2025, weighed in around 200lbs I really felt like it was time to get back on track.. my testosterone levels were below the normal healthy range, and my overall energy levels were down.

So! I‚Äôve been very consistent with lifting, protein intake, and long distance inline skating for cardio, with a mostly clean diet. Dropped about 2 1/2‚Äù off my waist, and lost 18lbs! Pretty excited with the outcome so far. I did a DEXA scan when I was about 186, and it showed me at 20% bf - which felt a little high.

I‚Äôm thinking that my target is probably 13-15%, and I‚Äôll maintain/lean gain from there. Also, ashwaganda along with the fat loss boosted the T levels back to normal-ish, though still on the low side. The main thing that matters is that I feel so much better overall.",post,r/WorkoutRoutines,Health,88.0,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1kyxjf4

I used to be fit & thin in my 20s from simply running ~2 miles a couple times a week and doing a handful of core exercises for ~10 min a day. *I'm now in early 40s and way out of shape.*

I'm wanting to create a workout plan, but I'm a chronic pain patient with ongoing nerve pain that is exacerbated by exercise and comes with constant high inflammation in my body. So, it'll take trial and error. I won't sweat the food side of things yet, I want to figure out the physical part 1st - but I know about deficits and like healthy food.

Any advice? I'm totally ignorant here and would appreciate thoughts.

All we do for shoulders is:

A - Bench (Front delts), Lateral Raises (Side Delts)

B: Seated dumbbell overhead press (Front Delts, some side delts), rows (some rear delts)

This way, you're stimulating front and side delts 3x/week rather than your current setup where you target side delts 1-2x/week. 

Can superset lateral raises with bicep curls if you want to save time.

I would drop the regular push-ups ‚Äì incline is better, but if you‚Äôre able to do 50,  elevate your hands a bit, such as by propping them up on yoga blocks or books, so you can bring your chest down below your hands.

The diamond push-ups are to get a focus on your triceps, right? Try doing them with your legs elevated and maybe only try to do 20 or 30, but do them before your incline push-ups so your triceps are ‚Äúpre-fatigued‚Äú and have to work harder during those incline push-ups.

Skip chest press on Push and do more sets of bench. You‚Äôll be happy with a greater improvement on bench press.

Same for hip thrusters, I‚Äôd do more deadlifts on Lower.

On Upper, I‚Äôd do chest supported row instead of barbell row. You‚Äôll want those lower back muscles to be fresh for your deadlifts on Lower.",comment_4,r/WorkoutRoutines,Health,,https://www.reddit.com/r/WorkoutRoutines/comments/1kz1f7d/new_ppl_x_ul_split/

So a couple examples of how you could program that:

1st set 4-6 reps @ 115-120kg

2nd set AMRAP @ 90-100kg

and try to add a kg or so each week.

Or, cycle through it over a number of weeks, starting with something easy and working up to a new max. eg:

Week 1: 90\*10

Week 2: 100\*8

"Tricep out pacing bicep growth significantly Lifted on and off since I was 14, nothing ever incredibly serious, but consistent enough where I can build muscle. 

6‚Äô1, 31 y/o male, 255. Worked my way down from 305 very slowly over the last two years and have been taking it very serious since the start of the year.

Right now, I have a bench and the bowflex dumbbells that go from 5-90lbs and that is all I use. I do a PPL split. 

My triceps grow incredibly fast and are visible much more so than my biceps and I suspect it is for 1 of 2 reasons. 

1. My elbows are generally tucked pretty close to my sides when I do any press lift. I believe this might be activating my triceps significantly more than my pull exercises are activating my biceps in my ancillary lifts that activate the respective muscles (ie, bench hits tri a bit, row hits bi a bit etc.). 

2. I don‚Äôt carry a ton of weight on my arms, rather primarily in my mid section and back (gifted, I know). My shoulders all around are starting to show good growth, as are my triceps. My biceps however, do not appear to be filling out as quickly as my triceps are. Is it because the muscle is smaller?

Bonus: usually my split for P/P is something like; 

Push:
Bench, incline, Arnold‚Äôs, side raises, tri extensions. First four lifts are usually 8-10 reps 4x, tri extensions usually 12-20 reps. 4 sets, only lift I do for triceps. 

Pull: 
row, shrug, rear delt raises, (4x-10) and then some combination of hammer and curls (4x each) for 10-15 reps. 

I am doing essentially double the volume with the bicep sets in my pull sessions vs 4 sets of one lift on triceps.

"It just makes a lot of sense. Triceps are naturally bigger and involved in a lot of pressing movements, so if your elbows stay tucked during bench presses, they get worked a lot. Biceps usually need more direct work like curls to catch up, especially since they‚Äôre smaller muscles.

I had a similar experience where my triceps outpaced my biceps, and adding more focused bicep work like different curl variations helped balance things out. Also, sometimes the way you do rows or pull exercises can affect bicep activation, so switching grip or form might help.

"Hi Chloe :).
  
Been suffering for a few years now.  It's manifestations can be awful and really debilitating.
  
Mine works in waves or cycles.
  
First of all you'll notice a symptom or bodily sensation that might be real or just a normal symptom (headache, tiredness, ache after exercise).  Your brain immediately goes to the worst case scenario with these symptoms.  It's never I have a leg ache because I had a hard run last night, it's immediately what if that's a tumour, what if that's a metastatic cancer.
  
You then spend the next hours/days and weeks checking this leg ache, checking if your calves are the same size, measuring them taking photos.  Long after the initial symptoms should have gone (but haven't due to constantly touching and rubbing them), you then over analyse how you walk, how your leg feels all throughout the day, your leg nerves and muscles are the loudest possible sensations in your body 
  
All while this is going on, you seek reassurance so you search forums, go on Google, ask friends in a roundabout way and you come across an anecdote or story about a random person dying of leg cancer and their symptoms were leg cancer and shortness of breath.
  
The next day your body makes you short of breath, so you start breathing funny, analysing your breathing and it starts to give you chest pains.  Well you remember from a googling session months ago that this could be the sign of a blood clot on the lung.  

Before long you've forgotten your leg cancer and you're obsessed with your imminent death from a PE.
  
This is my life day to day, I have good days and bad days.  Imagine the above story that bounces around my whole body.  Not believing doctors, getting side effects from medication after reading the pamphlet.

"Undiagnosed but suffering‚Äîwould love advice or just to feel less alone Hi everyone,

I‚Äôve been feeling really unwell since January, and I‚Äôm honestly at my breaking point. I don‚Äôt have a diagnosis yet, but the symptoms have been progressively debilitating, and I‚Äôm now practically bedridden most days. I‚Äôm hoping someone here might relate or have advice‚ÄîI‚Äôm just feeling really lost.

My ANA came back positive at 1:40 (speckled, nuclear), but PCP told me it‚Äôs a ‚Äúlow‚Äù titer and not to worry. I tested positive so I expected her to refer me to a rheumatologist due to my symptoms as well so I had to ask her to refer me to one. üôÑ Meanwhile, I feel like I‚Äôm falling apart. Here‚Äôs what I‚Äôm dealing with:
	‚Ä¢	Severely swollen/inflamed stomach (I literally look pregnant most days)
	‚Ä¢	Tachycardia
	‚Ä¢	Joint, bone, and muscle pain + full-body flu-like symptoms
	‚Ä¢	Severe rashes
	‚Ä¢	Brain fog and intense fatigue
	‚Ä¢	Stiffness (especially in the mornings)
	‚Ä¢	Shooting pains in my wrists, ankles, hands, and neck
	‚Ä¢	Tinnitus
	‚Ä¢	Chest pains
	‚Ä¢	Light and cold sensitivity
	‚Ä¢	Rapid gum recession

It feels like every part of my body is screaming, and no one can tell me why. I do have a rheumatology appointment on June 25, which feels forever away, and I‚Äôm scared of being dismissed again. I‚Äôve had too many appointments end in, ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs just wait and see,‚Äù while I continue to decline.

For context, my mom has Lupus, RA, and MCAS, so I‚Äôm especially concerned that something autoimmune is going on‚Äîpossibly even something overlapping. I‚Äôve mentioned this family history to doctors, but it doesn‚Äôt seem to spark much urgency.

If anyone has been through something similar:
	‚Ä¢	How did you navigate this undiagnosed limbo?
	‚Ä¢	Has anyone had meaningful answers or treatment after a low-positive ANA?
	‚Ä¢	Any tips for managing the wait until a rheum appointment‚Äîphysically or emotionally?

I feel like I‚Äôm just existing in survival mode right now, and the loneliness of it all is hitting hard. I‚Äôd really appreciate any advice, encouragement, or shared experiences.

"spent the night in the ER‚Ä¶ i rapidly developed urinary incontinence yesterday in the sense that i started peeing myself without even noticing i have to pee. i have lumbar degenerative disc disease and a herniated disc at L5-S1. my doctor told me to go to the ER to be evaluated for cauda equina. 

i did that - got a ct scan, did a bladder emptying test, peed in a cup, blood draws, etc. bladder emptying test had me with 95 ml remaining, and the ct scan ruled out cauda equina (thank god)

what they did find, though, was that i have a very very intense UTI with ‚Äúa lot‚Äù of white blood cells and bacteria in my urine. i have not experienced a single symptom of this UTI (until i became incontinent) - no urge to pee, no burning, no nothing. just a severely infected urinary tract with no symptoms except suddenly peeing myself at the store and the park. it‚Äôs just so weird? it makes me think there might be neurological involvement that‚Äôs too minor to be picked up by CT scan, that‚Äôs preventing me from sensing/fully emptying my bladder. the doctor agreed it was possible, but just sent me off with antibiotics and said to come back if they don‚Äôt make the incontinence stop. 

overall a bit of a medical mystery at least from my perspective - has anyone experienced similar? how did it resolve? can it really just be a super weird UTI or am i right to be suspicious of nerve involvement?

This is probably not relevant in your case but it is important information to know. Hyperparathyroidism can cause incontinence.

"True dat, however spinal conditions ain't nothing to fuck with and this is one of those times a second opinion is warranted. 

(I've been assessed for various shit so many times and always stuff has been missed, big stuff, mostly due to the limitations of ER)

(I've had a brutal brain injury missed in ER (which followed me smashing me head and even the senior neuro picked up on it in acute care but by the time I'd been transferred to a ward i fell through the gaps and recieved NO treatment- 

turned out I had a tethered spinal chord causing brain sag (hernitation) dislocated tail bone, fused neck bones AND cervical instability, scoliosis- 

which had set of violent convulsions/obscene spinal posturing/contortion/transient paralysis 

that caused me to smash my head

which led to ischemic injury (like a stroke but affecting both sides of the body cos the blood flow was cut off at the back of my neck at the junction between my skull) 

followed by similar to post stroke hemiballismus but affecting both sides of my body

OH they missed THE WHOLE LOT. 

Another time I've been assessed was by this great team who checked a lump in my boob and what a relief- they said it was benigh fibrous cyst. OOPS! It was breast cancer, late stage 3 by the time I was diagnosed. Stage 4 now. 

Not saying this to frighten you OP! Peeing your pants is an important early indicator of spinal maladies- get it checked and you can get on top of it and that's great!

All my shit would not have happened if I had a second opinion and 
appropriate, **timely** care

Not trying to make this about me, OP, but hopefully to share a cautionary tail, anecdotal wisdom to get you on track to best possible outcomes.

So I have generalized dystonia but it's pretty mild. I also have ADHD. I was off my ADHD meds because stimulants make it worse (I've tried alternatives and they don't do much). The meds for dystonia definitely don't help the ADHD... 

I took a few year hiatus from work while my health was bad. I've also got EDS and MCAS

Anyways I was working again this year (as a substitute teacher) and the ADHD was really getting to me.  I've gone back on adderall. First time back on it. I know it's summer now and all but it felt like the right choice. Anyways I'm feeling the dystonia getting worse like before. I forgot how bad it was.

"I have a gut feeling something is very wrong but doctors see I take a mood stabilizer and immediately think I just have anxiety. Hi all, 

I‚Äôll get right into it. I have always been extremely active. I started running track in middle school, then ran cross country freshman/sophomore year. With running I plateaued even though I know I pushed myself way above average. I was passing out a lot and had been diagnosed with dysautonomia by a cardiologist, but pretty much just continued on with life. I moved up to weight lifting and pretty much any type of exercise I could get access to. I was addicted to it and it made me feel so good. It was a huge part of my identity. This continued into college for my first few years.  Out of nowhere, I‚Äôd be 5 minutes into a workout and would have to lay on the ground or else I was passing out. I was in EXTREMELY good shape, but then suddenly couldn‚Äôt even do a light workout. I pushed through on better days until eventually I had to stop going all together because I felt so ill just from barely doing anything. I tried to keep active as much as possible with walking and light at-home things until eventually my whole body just felt so weak and tired that I stopped altogether. Fast forward 4 years and I‚Äôm experiencing life altering symptoms that will not go away. I‚Äôve been going to doctors for years and I always end up being brushed off. I have had a huge struggle with mental health since I was a little girl, so when doctors see the medication I take they immediately chalk my symptoms up to anxiety and being a worry wart. Well here‚Äôs the symptoms that have turned me into someone I don‚Äôt even recognize: EXTREME fatigue, brain fog and confusion (I was valedictorian & got an engineering degree while serving full time. I used to be so sharp), night sweats where I wake up smelling terrible and soaking wet, constant vertigo, feeling drunk and dizzy with absolutely nothing in my system, nausea especially in the mornings, heart palpitations, my heart rate skyrockets just standing up and my blood pressure drops drastically, even after letting it regulate for 3 minutes, when I eat meals I literally feel like I ate poison or have diabetes, I can‚Äôt eat more than small portions (really small portions) when I used to take food in like a garbage disposal, my periods are completely all over the place even on birth control, my body cannot regulate its temperature, I go from shivering to slick with sweat back and forth back and forth whilst just sitting at my desk, it feels like my body thinks we are in the apocalypse and yes I do have EXTREME anxiety, but I‚Äôm very self aware and have learned to discern anxiety from real threats as much as one can at this point in her journey, (sorry for tmi) I have diarrhea about 4 times a day, I have to pee literally constantly it almost makes me want to cry from frustration (no uti), I get episodes when I over do it (and by over do it I mean walking up two flights of stairs) my face will turn red as a tomato, my pores open and start sweating profusely, I get presyncope, and often start projectile vomiting, I get migraines constantly. Im probably forgetting some but I seriously can‚Äôt take this anymore. No one believes me when I tell them how much I‚Äôm suffering because ‚ÄúI look fine from what they can see and I keep up with everything.‚Äù But they don‚Äôt understand I have nothing and no one to fall back on. I have the weight of the world on my shoulders and it‚Äôs never been an option to just quit my job and rest or whatever tf people think will solve my issues. I‚Äôve been going to doctors for years and they just kept brushing me off and not taking me seriously. Finally I found a doctor that will listen to me when I make requests for tests and bloodwork. My last bloodwork shows that my cortisol levels are literally off the charts, I have high prolactin, low iron (I take iron supplements), and a few other less alarming things out of range. The entire maternal side of my family has had a thyroid issue or cancer. I‚Äôve gotten multiple ultrasounds on mine and they find multiple nodules/colloids every time. My thyroid literally always looks swollen but they just brush it off even with my medical history because my t levels are ‚Äúnormal‚Äù even though they fluctuate all through the years. Finally, I sent all of these symptoms in my health portal so that they would finally document them. I would tell doctors all of these symptoms and they‚Äôd cut me off after 3-5. So I would be damned if I‚Äôm brushed off again. I now have an mri scheduled to rule out a pituitary tumor and I finally found a gastro that would give me a colonoscopy and endoscopy. These are all scheduled in the next few weeks. I also forgot to mention I had a cardiologist diagnose me again with dysautonomia, however he said it was secondary meaning my heart wasn‚Äôt the issue, something else was causing my body to react. I have had a gut feeling that something is so not right for so long and I‚Äôm honestly scared for these tests. I know cancer is seriously on the rise for young people and it just makes me so angry that our world has been polluted with so many toxins and chemicals that we have no way of escaping. I‚Äôm hoping for good results from both tests, but that also leaves me at square one if they come back negative. I just miss who I used to be. I can‚Äôt stay out late with friends because I‚Äôm just so tired to my bones I could cry. I‚Äôve become so isolated because post graduation many friends moved away. And my family just sucks and I‚Äôm estranged so I have no support from them at all. I guess I‚Äôm just angry that I haven‚Äôt been taken seriously and I‚Äôm angry for losing so many years of my 20s to whatever is happening to my body. I just want answers and I just want to feel alive again. All I do is work and go to bed and it‚Äôs just terrible especially with how many disgusting and horrifying things are taking place across the globe. If anyone is in a similar boat, feel free to vent your frustrations to me. We all deserve to be given attentive care and for people to believe us when we say we are suffering. I‚Äôll update after these upcoming tests in a few weeks with hopefully good news. I‚Äôm not sure what I really posted this for.

"I‚Äôm so sorry you‚Äôre experiencing all this, and being disbelieved on top of having these symptoms is so awful.

I have long covid and I think (when I was healthy) I had very mild dysautonomia before, but it was barely noticeable aside from high heart rate and occasionally dizzy for a few seconds when I stood up, but it never interfered with my life or ability to do physical activity.

"Anyone else out there with CMUSE (Cryptogenic Multifocal Ulcerous Stenosing Enteritis)? Hi everyone, I know this is an incredibly rare condition, but I wanted to post here in hopes that someone else might be out there with CMUSE or knows someone who is.

I‚Äôm in Australia and live with Cryptogenic Multifocal Ulcerous Stenosing Enteritis (CMUSE) an extremely rare and poorly understood disease of the small bowel that causes multiple ulcerations, strictures, and bowel obstructions.

My diagnosis journey was long and traumatic. For years, my symptoms were dismissed and misdiagnosed. Eventually, a capsule endoscopy revealed there was something seriously wrong which led to my first bowel surgery.

Since then, I‚Äôve had a total of five small bowel resections including three resections in just nine months early on. Unfortunately, my disease recurs rapidly with new ulceration and strictures returning in less than two months after surgery. 

Between my third and fourth resections, I finally found the incredible medical team who still look after me today. They began trialling treatments we‚Äôve tried prednisone, budesonide, methotrexate, infliximab (which I was allergic to), and Stelara and I‚Äôm currently on prednisone and Humira.

At one point, I was requiring weekly iron infusions and fortnightly blood transfusions, along with regular electrolyte infusions (potassium, phosphate, magnesium) because my levels were constantly dangerously low.

By the time I reached my fourth surgery, strictures were so tight my surgeon described it as looking ‚Äúlike a walnut‚Äù nothing could get through them anymore.

After that surgery, I managed 11 months before I needed my fifth bowel resection this time with a permanent ileostomy as well.

But my most traumatic experience came after that surgery. I developed life-threatening complications and was rushed to hospital with sepsis, aspiration pneumonia, and a critical electrolyte depletion crisis. I was so unstable they couldn‚Äôt even move me from ED to ICU initially. The next morning, the ICU consultant told me: ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt know how you‚Äôre still alive.‚Äù

Since then, my battle has continued. I now undergo regular day surgeries, initially weekly, now fortnightly, to dilate my small bowel, as new strictures keep forming. I also do hospital admissions every couple of months for a week of gut rest and have TPN. I‚Äôm getting a port placed next month so I can access TPN more regularly and hopefully can do it at home rather then hospital, as eating causes me severe pain, nausea, and I can‚Äôt tolerate any fibre so I don‚Äôt get much nutrition from food anymore.

To this day, none of my doctors have ever treated another CMUSE patient. There‚Äôs still very little research, and no clear roadmap for treatment or prognosis. We are essentially figuring it out as we go.

That said I remain hopeful. When I was first diagnosed, there was only one research article I could find on CMUSE. Now it‚Äôs mentioned on the Mayo Clinic site, has its own Wikipedia entry, and more studies are finally being done. I also personally believe CMUSE isn‚Äôt as rare as they think it may simply be under-diagnosed or misdiagnosed, given how complex and similar it can look to Crohn‚Äôs or other bowel diseases.

So I‚Äôm posting here in hopes of finding anyone else out there with CMUSE or who knows someone with it. I‚Äôd love to connect, share experiences, and not feel so alone with this rare diagnosis.

Thank you so much for reading and sending strength to anyone else living with rare or difficult chronic conditions. üíô",post,r/ChronicIllness,Health,5.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChronicIllness/comments/1l0249o/anyone_else_out_there_with_cmuse_cryptogenic/

From the outside, you probably look fine. You walk outside, meet people, smile. And no one knows what‚Äôs really going on inside you.
And after a while, you even start questioning yourself.

There‚Äôs so much we lose when we‚Äôre sick, but no one calls it grief.
You lose parts of your old self.
Things that used to be easy now take effort.
You start adjusting your dreams, changing your plans, and suddenly your whole life feels shaped by limits you never asked for.
And maybe the hardest part: people stop checking in the way they used to, and you stop reaching out too.

It‚Äôs hard to talk about this stuff. You try, but often you get the same looks ‚Äî ‚ÄúBut you don‚Äôt look sick?‚Äù
So most of us just carry it silently. Quietly. Alone.

I wanted to share this today because maybe someone out there will read it and think, ‚ÄúYes‚Ä¶ I know this feeling.‚Äù
Maybe someone will feel a little less alone in their own quiet grief.
And maybe, little by little, we can remind each other that just because something is invisible doesn‚Äôt mean it isn‚Äôt heavy.",post,r/ChronicIllness,Health,398.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChronicIllness/comments/1kz5kja/the_hidden_grief_of_living_with_an_invisible/

"This hit me hard because it‚Äôs exactly what I‚Äôve been living through. After years of tests and being told everything looks ‚Äúnormal,‚Äù I finally learned I have a circulatory disorder that doesn‚Äôt fit any standard box. Even at the Cleveland Clinic, the top doctors still haven‚Äôt acknowledged it. My body depends on precise blood return (preload) to function ‚Äî when that drops, I crash. The scary part? My heart pumps well, labs are stable, but I still get breathless, weak, and dizzy from everyday things like eating or standing. That disconnect has left me misjudged for years.

What‚Äôs worse is realizing that I may be dealing with a new or poorly recognized phenotype of heart failure ‚Äî one that isn‚Äôt fully acknowledged in textbooks or one that has clear treatment guidelines. The physical symptoms are exhausting, but the emotional toll of not being believed or understood might be worse.

"You are so right, there is a lot of grief intertwined living with an invisible illness.

I often keep my grief to myself because most people don‚Äôt understand or refuse to hear a different perspective. Having chronic illness is isolating and we become forgotten to the people around us and in society. Our lives stop while we see the world continue to live theirs. It hurts seeing people traveling, achieving milestones, going after their dreams while we are just trying to survive day to day.

"Have had both.  I have diagnosed gastroparesis, and had a cholecystectomy due to gallstones.

For the GES, you eat eggs (and sometimes bread).  The eggs contain a radioactive tracer.  You then get periodic scans to see how much of that tracer remains in your stomach.  You lie down for the scans.  

Some places have you walk around between scans, or allow you to drink water, which can skew results, as both can impact motility.

I was nauseous, but no more than my normal with eating a small amount of food.

For the HIDA scan, you drink something like Ensure.  The one my hospital used had things I‚Äôm allergic to (soy) so they just gave me coffee creamer.  Same thing - they check to see how the body responds.  I experienced the same pain as any other time I had a meal.  My scans were done standing for this test.

Keep in mind that these tests are just snapshots.  So results can vary if the test is done more than once, due to a variety of factors - like these being dynamic conditions and the fact that we can‚Äôt schedule them when we‚Äôre symptomatic.  Most GES, for example, are done earlier on the day, but motility worsens for most people later in the day.  Most doctors treat these tests like they‚Äôre flawless, but ones that truly understand realize that, while they can confirm these diagnoses, they cannot definitively rule them out.",comment_1,r/ChronicIllness,Health,,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChronicIllness/comments/1l00mbc/gastric_emptying_and_gallbladder_function_test/

"Did going to a psychiatrist help? I'm 15F with probable ME/CFS, of course all the doctors start speaking about how the most important thing is to treat my symptoms and not get a diagnosis, and how when you start searching for illnesses you see that many illnesses fit yourself :/ Anyway the probable ME/CFS is not only based on my research and me seeing that I have all the criteria for it, I got sent to an  psychiatrist by my neurologist and my  psychiatrist has said that in the referral my neurologist wrote ""Can this be ME/CFS?"". Anyway my question is, should I continue going to the  psychiatrist?? Has it been helpful for you?

I feel like I don't really know why I'm there, I've been there two times and I feel like I don't really know what I'm doing there. I have accepted my life now, with headaches, fatigue, body aches every day. Not being able to do lots of things and feeling like shit most of the time, I have accepted it. It's just been 9 months and I've accepted it, this is not the life I wanted, but it's still a life, I can live like this. I thought my  psychiatrist was going to help me getting through this or something like that, but I honestly don't feel like I need help.

She talked about how she could help me live with the pain, but I feel like I'm already doing it pretty well.  She talked about how she could show me to just accept the pain, for example if I get a headache, to just accept it and say ""hello headache, there you are again"", but I feel like I'm already doing it. I'm constantly in pain, if it's not my head it's my leg, if it's not my leg it's my heart palpitations going up to 160bpm etc. When I get a headache(which is every day, so many times a day, so many times per hour) I just kinda think ""well, there it is again, what a great life"" and then continue with whatever it is I'm doing.

After three times with her I was going to decide if I wanted to continue, because she said that I had to see if this was something for me, and if I thought she had something to offer for me. And at this point I'm thinking to not continue, but I think my parents thinks this is a great idea and also I don't want to be dumb and just think I'm doing great and I can manage and everything, I just don't want to miss out on something that actually could have helped me, so did going to a psychiatrist help you???

thanks in advance and sorry for the lengthy post! Have a nice day!

2) i followed a program in a high credited hospital containing 12 groupsessions with a psychologist WHO SPECIALISES in ME/CFS and 2 sessions with a physiotherapist. It made a huge difference to me.

"‚Ä¶ Are you seeing a psychiatrist or a psychologist? The first can prescribe meds, the second one can‚Äôt and is for talk therapy.

I think having both on board is super helpful, but psychiatry has been especially helpful in prescribing meds that help me live a better life. I remember trying Cymbalta and that really helped my pain and gave me energy, I just also had some side effects I couldn‚Äôt tolerate. Now I take Sertraline/Zoloft and that really helps with my chronic pain and my GI symptoms.

You could ask them about ‚ÄúWhat are the goals for our appointments? I thought I was just referred to be evaluated for a ME/CFS diagnosis, I‚Äôm unsure what your thoughts are on that or if I should be utilizing our appointments as therapy to talk about anything.‚Äù

If you don‚Äôt feel like the appointments are helping right now, you can also say ‚ÄúI‚Äôm unsure about totally stopping therapy, but I‚Äôm also unsure if I need as much help right now since I‚Äôm handling things okay.

I‚Äôm about to have a laparoscopy next week but thinking about the possibility that it will also show no results is really affecting my mental health. 

I just feel clueless and empty knowing that I‚Äôm running out of diagnostic tools, plus the stress of possibly being labelled a ‚Äúhypochondriac‚Äù for pushing my doctor to keep investigating. 

I‚Äôm already seeing a psychologist regularly, on antidepressants which have helped a LOT, engage in exercise, follow a healthy diet and use resources online.

"Is the Make America Healthy Again Commission missing the key factor driving most chronic diseases and cancers: the infectious microbes that humans pass to each other. More and more studies are linking chronic diseases and cancers to microbial infections in the body tissues. The current administration in the US is trying to understand why there is so much ill health and chronic disease about. The¬†**Make America Healthy Again (MAHA) Commission**wants to figure out what is causing all this disease, and to try to do something about it.

Unfortunately, MAHA seem to be clueless about the¬†[connection between everyday infectious micro-organisms and chronic diseases](https://me-pedia.org/wiki/List_of_chronic_diseases_linked_to_infectious_pathogens). So they are looking at the usual suspects: diet, environmental toxins, and lifestyle factors, thinking that the cause of disease is to be found there.

Whilst these factors can and do play a role in disease initiation, people who are not exposed to toxins, and with excellent diets and lifestyle, still get chronic diseases and cancers. So clearly, there is more to disease initiation than these factors that MAHA are looking at.

I believe that until we start to fully appreciate that¬†**infectious microbes may be a fundamental cause of diseases,**¬†both physical and mental, we may never be able to reduce the heavy burden of chronic disease and cancer present in society.

There are numerous examples of viruses and bacteria that have been linked to disease. For example, Epstein-Barr virus is linked to multiple sclerosis, and some researcher think that once we have an effective EBV vaccine, that will entirely eliminate MS as a disease. Eliminating EBV may also reduce the incidence of other autoimmune diseases.

Coxsackievirus B is another culprit virus which is linked to many illnesses, such as type 1 diabetes, sudden heart attacks in the previously healthy, heart valve disease, cardiomyopathy, Sjogren's syndrome, chronic fatigue syndrome, and others. 

Researchers who believe that infectious microbes may be the primary cause of most chronic diseases and cancers include: evolutionary biologist Paul W. Ewald, physicist and anthropologist Gregory Cochran, Hanan Polansky, Garth L. Nicolson, Siobh√°n M. O'Connor, Steven S. Coughlin, Keizo Tomonaga, Timothy J.

"How do you NOT try to 'get better' during a flare I'm sure title sounds weird but hear me out.

I'm having a severe flare, it's been nearly two weeks. It was triggered by a really weird and tough period, then a histamine reaction that caused my lips to swell to the point of splitting, which of course then got infected which just prolonged the flare. I have things I want to do - it's the start of gardening season, and I'm working on several crochet projects - but every time I think I'm getting better, I get hit by fatigue or a migraine or something else that knocks me out for another day.

I feel like my constant 'okay I need to get better fast so I can do stuff, tomorrow is gonna be the day I do stuff' attitude might be contributing to the fatigue. Like, during flares I'm supposed to allow my body to get the rest it needs, but if I'm spending all day planning what I'm going to do the next day when I'm 'better,' I'm not really resting, just stressing. I've been trying to just let myself accept that I'm in a flare and don't know when I'll be out of it, but it's a lot harder than it sounds.

My other coping mechanism for the list getting long while I‚Äôm recovering from a crash  I don‚Äôt try to hold the whole list in my head. If I start getting carried away with the list, I ask myself which of those things I need to do first. Then I focus just on that. Visualize. Plan it out in detail. It eases my tension to know I‚Äôm totally mentally prepared to do the next thing when my body is up to it. And then I can put that and the list aside for a time and focus on the rest. Rest well.

"Got my first rollator at 16 today - feeling a mix of relief, sadness, and fear. 

 
first post here :) Hi everyone, I‚Äôm 16 and today I got my first rollator. I‚Äôve been dealing with worsening pain and weakness in my legs and back for a while, to the point of not being able to walk to the bathroom. after doctors recommendations I finally got a mobility aid to help me get around. I‚Äôm using splints and compression socks too, and it honestly helps, but it‚Äôs a lot to emotionally process.

There‚Äôs relief in finally having something that helps, but also this heavy sadness and fear. I didn‚Äôt expect to need a walker so young. It‚Äôs hard not to feel embarrassed, or worry about what people will think. Some friends left me on opened when I sent them a picture of it, and that stung more than I expected. I know they are embarrassed, i don‚Äôt think they want to be seen with me anymore with their guy friends and stuff. 

I still don‚Äôt have a full diagnosis, and that makes everything feel even scarier. My body is changing so quickly and I‚Äôm doing my best to keep up, but I‚Äôm also grieving the version of myself who could walk her dog and go out and didn‚Äôt need help simply standing.

If you‚Äôve been through something like this getting your first mobility aid, especially at a young age, I‚Äôd love to hear how you coped, how you grew, or how you learned to accept it.

"I just turned 20 and have recently started having to use a cane because of autoimmune involvement affecting my connective tissues and joints. It has greatly impacted my ability to walk and stand. I‚Äôm still in the process of getting diagnosed too, and going unmedicated has been so painful. Becoming chronically ill definitely isn‚Äôt how I expected to end my teenage years, but it has also made me so much more empathetic and understanding towards people who also struggle with their health. Mobility aids, especially for people at a young age, are sometimes hard for healthy people to fully understand, and it can take a little bit to adjust to it for you and those around you. But once the initial shock wears off, no one really cares I‚Äôve noticed. I was embarrassed at first too, but it‚Äôs actually an amazing thing to have and one of the best decisions I‚Äôve made since becoming sick. My body thanks me every time I decide to use my cane instead of pushing myself too far and paying for it later. It‚Äôs a form of self care ‚ù§Ô∏è",comment_2,r/ChronicIllness,Health,,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChronicIllness/comments/1kzj5tb/got_my_first_rollator_at_16_today_feeling_a_mix/
"\*hugs\*  What type did you get? I hope it's one that you like and one that you can get accessories, like a water bottle holder and other items, easily.

I know how boring they can look, feel free to decorate it however you want. Get some fun colour metallic spray paints,  glue to glue on sparkly gems, or any other ideas you have. If you have friends who will come over, get help decorating it. 

I got my rollator before I expected and I use it not as much as I should, but especially when there will be a lot of walking and not enough places to sit. I like that mine (a Nexus from Human care) has a metal basket that I can remove to hold things, the seat is okay & that the back rest is easy to repair. I needed a new one after about 15 years.

There are things I could do to feel better. Exercise being one of them. I don‚Äôt, it hurts. But I know it would help in the long term. 
There are also things I have done, that make me feel better, that I choose over and over to do, to give to myself. I rest and I ask for help. I drink water and I eat good food. I give myself love and grace.
But damn, 
I‚Äôm exhausted and I don‚Äôt want to be. I feel like if I could just give it a little more, everything would be better. I‚Äôd do more, I‚Äôd increase my capacity, my house would be clean, I‚Äôd make enough money.

"trouble gaining weight TW: discussion of weight my neurologist thinks i have some autonomic disorder that gives me a false sense of fullness. that and the heat, it gets really bad in the shmmer. worst it's been was bmi 15 last year. i got to close to a healthy weight this winter and i was so happy but i randomly lost 7 lbs. weight always just falls off of me. i cannot keep any healthy fat on me. i can lose 5 lbs so quick. some doctors in the past told me this is unusual but normal, i just have very small thin bones and high metabolism. but my weight doesn't feel normal. (yes my thyroid is fine, doctors have checked it multiple times a year at this point)

i try to drink weight gain shakes but they just make me throw up. i throw up easy and it's even made me scared to eat at times. it's either eat and get sick, or have people tell me i look sick. I have issues with swallowing too, it's like all odds are against me from ever being a healthy weight. i always blame myself that im not trying enough. 

i always associate my thinness with my sickness. I don't think a lot of people comprehend how distressed someone can be with being so extremely thin. no matter how many times i try to explain they won't take ""i'm not doing it on purpose"" for a answer. or they think im doing this werid round about way of bragging about being skinny. There's so little empathy, and i  feel like i cant talk about this without being met with hostility. when get excited and tell my mom i gained weight she tells me i still look sick, and i need to be at least 120.

it's bad at restaurants too. i can't even finish kids meals and waiters always ask me if everything is ok. I went on a first date with a girl once and she kept saying ""reese you need to eat... seriously you need to eat :("" i get her concern but dang don't assume things, and like im not trying! or when people tell me they wish i had my problem, because trust me, you don't want a illness. it's emotionally distressing from a health aspect, and appearance wise, i feel like nobody should see my body.",post,r/ChronicIllness,Health,3.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChronicIllness/comments/1kzsac3/trouble_gaining_weight_tw_discussion_of_weight/

"Could this be a chronic illness? Since I was a kid, I've struggled with digestive issues, fatigue and depression. It was always written off as a mental health disorder. As I got older, I noticed it getting worse, but figured mental health meds just weren't working for me anymore. Then a year ago, I had an elective tubal ligation. After that, I had a SEVERE allergic reaction at the surgical sites. Rashes 3 inches around, blisters, extreme itching. Went and had it looked at and was told it would go away in a couple weeks. It didn't. It lasted months, and even now the sites still randomly turn red, swell up and itch like crazy. Ever since then, I've been plagued by fatigue that feels like I've been awake for days, dizziness that has made me fall off steps, even worse digestive issues, severe brain fog (almost like I have something squeezing my brain), heat sensitivity, doing literally anything makes me start sweating and I have to stop and cool down so I stop feeling like I'm going to pass out. I also get random symptoms. Legs will go numb for a couple days at a time, making it hard to walk. Entire body will feel like I got hit by a truck for days. I've  gone to doctors,  my blood work all comes back fine, I'm not diabetic, a heart monitor for 3 days didn't show anything. They keep saying it's depression, but like...there's no way. I don't know what to ask for, or what to do anymore. I do know that I can't keep living like this though, especially because it's progressing fast. I'm even losing coordination skills.

"Connective tissue SWAN So this is a question I have already given up on being answered in my lifetime-- but maybe someone can help me, or just gets what it is I'm dealing with. 

I have a hypermobile genetic connective tissue disorder that is similar but distinct from Ehlers Danlos (geneticist told me he put it somewhere between EDS and Loeys-Dietz). I was diagnosed when I was 10 along with my two brothers and my mother (there are obvious indications of my aunts/uncles/cousins on that side of the family also having the same issue, but they all live in England and apparently refuse to pursue any kind of diagnosis lol). According to my mom, when we were initially diagnosed the geneticist (or whoever) told her that there was no name currently but that there would be a name in the next 3ish years. That was 15 years ago; if there's been any such developments I haven't heard about them. 

I visited another geneticist when I was 19, who came to effectively the same conclusion. His explanation was that I obviously had some kind of genetic CTD, but my Beighton score and some other factors didn't meet the criteria for any specific disorder. Also had gene testing and obviously nothing came back. 

Symptomatically, there's not a lot that differentiates what I have from EDS. I suspect my hypermobility is not as extreme as typical hEDS but i'm not really sure. There are also some distinct symptoms and comorbidities that are hard to place but I don't think are typical of hEDS (i.e. we had very brittle/broke several bones as kids). 

Recently, I've been going through a massive flare of ME/CFS, and additionally experiencing so many random pain and subluxations and just generally being painfully (lol) aware of my disability. And I guess I'm just shouting into the void because honestly it can feel so isolating to have an unnamed disorder. When even the most similar known/named disorder is rare and woefully under-researched, it becomes just a guessing game based on anecdotal experience. I don't really expect anyone to comment saying ""oh here's the name"" lol, but idk, maybe someone has something similar going on and can give some insight.

"I am in the exact same place. My intestines prolapsed into the base of my pelvis (a condition called ""visceroptosis"") almost exclusively seen in Ehlers Danlos patient cohort but because I got 3 for the Beighton Score, they won't diagnose it EDS (I also have dysautonomia, MCAS, endometriosis, adenomyosis, autism and a long laundry list of other conditions that often co-exist in the EDS community). It's beyond frustrating because as long as it's not ""neatly"" diagnosed on my medical chart it's so easy to slip through the cracks even though everything I'm dealing with has left me dependent on a central line, malnourished and disabled.

"I‚Äôm similar. I‚Äôm currently diagnosed with hEDS but despite having a negative Invitae panel, I was referred by my EDS specialist for further genetic testing because my presentation is unusual. My old geneticist called me an ‚ÄúEDS overachiever‚Äù because I have so many symptoms and comorbidities. However the extent of my GI involvement is a little atypical, as is the number of mental health/ neurodevelopmental conditions I have. I also have more tissue fragility than is typically seen in hEDS. I have some of the vEDS craniofacial features, which is actually why I had the Invitae panel done in the first place. I have quite a few anatomical variations as well, and some skeletal anomalies, the latter of which seem to have a hereditary component. Additionally, whatever HCTD it is that‚Äôs in my family seems to have an autosomal recessive inheritance pattern, which is not typical of hEDS (though possible). The only other people with connective tissue issues are my sister, grandma, and a second cousin who is not a blood relative to my grandma. My grandmother‚Äôs father also likely had it as his skin was described as even thinner and more fragile than mine.

My theory, which my PCP and EDS specialist don‚Äôt disagree with is that it‚Äôs either a different HCTD besides hEDS, or there‚Äôs another genetic disorder in addition to the hEDS.",comment_2,r/ChronicIllness,Health,,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChronicIllness/comments/1kzpuds/connective_tissue_swan/

"Rheumatology appointment frustration + update!! Ugh okay so I will try to be as respectful as possible because I understand that this is not a doctor hate sub but I had my first appointment with rheumatology today and I can‚Äôt help but feel like the PA I saw was a bit of an asshole. He asked about my pain and what I do to help it and when I told him I take NSAIDs like Advil but that don‚Äôt help much he said ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not inclined to believe you. Anyone with inflammatory back pain sees significant improvement with NSAIDs.‚Äù

I understand that what I expressed was contrary to his experience but there is nothing more discouraging than a doctor saying they don‚Äôt believe you. I also went there specifically because I need further testing to confirm a possible autoimmune and he just basically said ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think your pain is autoimmune. If it were, it would get better with activity, not worse.‚Äù He still ordered some further tests so I guess it could have been worse but it was just frustrating.

I had been waiting for this appointment on their wait list for months trying to get in and get answers but now I just feel stupid. Every symptom I explained seemed to hardly matter to him, he‚Äôd just say ‚Äúokay.‚Äù No further questions or comments. And idk maybe he was just trying to stay neutral since we have no results yet from the labs but it just felt like he didn‚Äôt care honestly.

I‚Äôm more discouraged than ever trying to figure out my health even though technically I am getting testing and all. Just hard to deal with a medical professional who looks at you like you‚Äôre stupid when you‚Äôre there because you‚Äôve been miserable since you were 12.

Anyways, that is all.

Update: I have been diagnosed with MCTD and Hashimoto‚Äôs based on the bloodwork. So yeah! I am lucky that I got some answers.

"Honestly, while this isn't a doctor hate sub, this sub doesn't have the highest opinion of mid levels, particularly those who are practicing outside their scope. Mid levels are for stable follow up out patient. They're not for diagnosing a new patient. They just aren't qualified. Sometimes they do intake to determine what initial tests should be done for a doctor to make a diagnosis but you should them follow up with a doctor to go over those test results. If you aren't scheduled to see a doctor please try to get into one! You deserve the opinion of a real doctor not just a mid level.

"I'm worried Hi everyone,
I have an MRI result due back on Monday, and honestly, I‚Äôm terrified. I‚Äôve been in chronic pain for months ‚Äî intense lower abdominal pain, stabbing episodes that drop me to the floor, constant nausea, vomiting if I walk too far, and waves of dizziness and pressure. I feel like I‚Äôm holding everything in like if I sneeze, something might fall out. My mobility is impacted. I use a stick when I have to walk, and even then, I often end up being sick after walking.

I‚Äôve had a gastric bypass in the past and I‚Äôve changed my diet drastically, even avoided foods that could trigger sickness  but the pain and nausea come in waves regardless. It‚Äôs worst around my period, but it‚Äôs always there. It feels real. It is real. But I‚Äôm scared the MRI won‚Äôt show anything., my 3 previous ultrasounds showed suggestive adenomyosis and some cysts on my ovaries. The mri is because she wanted to check for deep infiltrating endometriosis. I refuse to go back onto contraception. I started my period at 9 years old was placed on the pill at 10 years old. Come off contraception after 23 years continuation from the pills to injection, implant, coil only lasted a day was too painful went and had it remove. Implant after my 4th one my body rejected it. The pill makes me not feel with it and with my gastric bypass some pills are not effective. 

What happens if it comes back ‚Äúnormal‚Äù? Will anyone believe me then? My partner is supportive but even he is starting to doubt things.

"I‚Äôm so tired of my parents not accepting the severity of my health issues. I wish they understood. I have POTS, hEDS, Graves‚Äô Disease, and MCAS. Today the air quality is terrible, because wind has brought smoke from the fires in Canada. I‚Äôve had flare ups over and over. I feel like I‚Äôm sunburnt all over, even though I‚Äôm not. It feels like I can‚Äôt breathe, and my throat hurts. I had to work this morning, through multiple flare ups. When I finally got home, I was exhausted. My fianc√© called and asked how I was feeling, and when I told him, he offered to pick up our daughter from my parent‚Äôs house when he gets off of work so I could rest. 
My parents watch her any time I work, and I usually pick her up shortly after. I had even planned on doing so today, but was thrilled by my fianc√©‚Äôs offer as he gets off hours after me and it would allow me time to nap. 
Initially when I told my mom he would be picking her up, she didn‚Äôt have any issues with it. Although she made it seem like she didn‚Äôt really believe me when I said I was feeling horrible (this is a pattern for my parents, they tend to underestimate the severity of my health issues and treat me like I‚Äôm exaggerating). I laid down on my couch and just began to sleep when my dog starts barking and wakes me up. 
Turns out, without any warning, without any heads up, they decided to just drop my daughter off at home rather than wait for her to be picked up. They said it‚Äôs because they had an errand to run, but that doesn‚Äôt make sense to me since they would have had plenty of time to do so even with her dad coming to get her. They‚Äôve never seemed to have any problem having her around for any other things they have to get done while they watch her. 
If it were any other day, it might not be so bad. But today was just the worst day for this. With my daughter home, napping is out of the question (she‚Äôs 3, and she‚Äôs loud, and she likes a lot of attention, and she needs supervision, and she is beyond napping herself at this point). Silence, which I desperately need (did I mention I‚Äôm also Autistic?) is also not going be available to me. 
I may not have expected to get rest, but when it was offered I realized how much I desperately needed it. Especially because I have work early again tomorrow.

And I mean as far as Doctors go (I know the rule not gonna bash her) she‚Äôs alright, she listens, gets me referrals that I need and all that jazz) 

Anyway, the joke which I thought was funny‚Ä¶ 

Do I qualify for an Immune system transplant yet? 

Family said my illness isn‚Äôt that bad yet I have had more bad flare up days these last few years than I ever remember. The flare ups lasting weeks into months. Like last August until December where I had my thyroid out, system dropped in all counts, mouth sores that wouldn‚Äôt heal, covid and gout in my arms and neck  at the same time and then physical therapy bc the muscles in my back and legs no longer worked well enough to keep me standing and walking for more than mere seconds. 

It‚Äôs been a crazy rollercoaster and I‚Äôd really like to be off it now or well at least slow down. 

Alright. Now I‚Äôm going to take my 20 prescriptions or so and get to bed! 

Thanks for letting me vent, and if you got all through that, phew it was a lot, kudos.

"This is how my gastroparesis presents! It suuucks. Because I‚Äôm already diagnosed with EDS, and knew gastroparesis is a somewhat common comorbidity, I followed the Cleveland Clinic Gastroparesis diet until my appointment with the GI doctor came around. I ended up having to go to the ER for significant dehydration due to it. I‚Äôd had a previous gastric emptying study that showed a mild delay of the liquid phase, and I told the ER that. They gave me some IV reglan to see if that allowed me to eat and drink again and it did so they sent me home with enough to hold me over until I saw the new GI. In about 2 months, I had lost over 20lbs.

"Birthdays and social events My mom and I were talking about what we were going to do for my sister's birthday. She's really excited about it; it's in July and she's already planning it. I'm happy for her. She has plenty of friends and can enjoy eating almost whatever she wants, at any time she wants, and loves parties. She still holds illusion about her birthdays; she'll be 27 this year. And it's awesome.

And then I thought about what I would like to do for my own birthday... and no ideas came. Instead I felt this gray cloud of sadness hovering over me; like it has for the last few years since my health started declining. Getting older doesn't seem worth celebrating, considering each passing year I feel worse, even though everything comes back normal. Migraines, vertigo, chronic gastritis, GERD, nausea, tachycardia, pre-syncope, fatigue, Raynaud's, heat intolerance...

 Social events are hard for me. There pretty much always comes a time when I feel sick (either because of food or the noise) and have to hide because I suck at masking nausea. Also forget about eating anything conventionally delicious. You know, pizza, burgers, cheeses, anything with creamy sauces, steak, etc. I used to be such a huge foodie. Sometimes I'll feel miserable and have to make an Irish exit no matter how hard I tried to ""eat right"". It's incredibly frustrating and isolating. Honestly, my ray of sunshine during those days is my husband, who does everything to make me happy. Also, his birthday is the very next day after mine. His birthday makes me much happier than mine.

If you made it all the way here, thank you. Can you relate?

Tl;dr: I now feel sad instead of excited every time my birthday comes because I just deteriorate every year.",post,r/ChronicIllness,Health,5.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChronicIllness/comments/1kzhh6j/birthdays_and_social_events/

"My inflammation is high but my doctor is at a loss Hi I'm 35 F, I've been diagnosed with Fibromyalgia by my Rheumatologist years ago. I also have grade 3 fatty liver (which I am working on resolving through weight loss), and I have IBS as well. My Rheumatologist recently did some labs at my most recent visit to see if I had Lupus or RA pop up. She checks periodically since we thought I had some sort of autoimmune issue.

I got my SED Rate and C-Reactive tests back and they are high. 34 SED and 2.30 C-Reactive. She put me on a Prednisone taper that I did and finished. Two days after I finished I got the labs redone and they were higher.  35 SED and 2.90 C-Reactive this time. In March of this year my SED was 30. The last time before that I had it done it was 11 in 2020

She said she is at a loss because the steroids didn't make a difference at all. She told me to talk to my primary doc again.

The only thing I can think of is that I had CDiff last May and I haven't been the same since IBS wise. I've seen my GI since then like a handful of times. Tests indicate I don't have CDiff anymore and the only reason I got for my stomach issues since then is ""post infection IBS"". All my stool tests are normal, I had a colonoscopy 2 years ago and that was normal.

I've been so anxious about this, I just want to know what is wrong with me. My pain levels in general haven't been bad lately.",post,r/ChronicIllness,Health,8.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChronicIllness/comments/1kzfinw/my_inflammation_is_high_but_my_doctor_is_at_a_loss/

"Intestinos y gases I want to get support regarding an issue that has been causing me a lot of discomfort for a long time and is affecting my quality of life. It has to do with intestinal discomfort and excessive gas, which occur after eating any type of food. Let me explain more clearly.

After every meal‚Äîwhether breakfast, lunch, or dinner‚Äîthough mostly after lunch, I usually experience intestinal discomfort. Some days it's worse, some days it's milder, some days I feel nothing, and other days it's excessive throughout the entire day. It's an uncomfortable digestion, full of pain in the lower abdomen, bloating, and excessive intestinal gas‚Äînot burping, but actual intestinal gas.

I‚Äôve been trying to improve my diet and health for over a year and a half. I‚Äôve tried ketogenic, carnivore, and regular Mediterranean diets. I‚Äôve tried reducing foods high in FODMAPs‚Äîthose fermentable carbohydrates‚Äîto identify any intolerance that might be affecting my digestive system. However, despite all my efforts, while my symptoms may improve for a day or two, they often return again. It depends on what I eat‚Äîoats, eggs, a little rice, or some root vegetables like sweet potato, ripe plantain, or green plantain. I‚Äôve tried to reduce fats as much as possible, cooking with spray oil, drinking plenty of water (about two liters per day). I work out at the gym four days a week and play soccer at least once a week, so I‚Äôm a very active, healthy person.

This situation brings me a lot of discomfort and frustration, especially since I see people around me eating all kinds of food without any worry, while I have to think twice before eating something or eat it with the expectation that I might feel bad afterward‚Äîsometimes very bad.

I‚Äôve seen a doctor, and last year I had some evaluations done, including an endoscopy, colonoscopy, X-rays, and blood tests. All the results came back showing that I was in good health. They didn‚Äôt find any chronic illness or anything directly linked to these symptoms. At the end of the consultation, the doctor told me that my symptoms were more likely psychological than physical, which left me uncertain. However, I haven‚Äôt seen a psychologist since then.

I would like to find someone who has gone through the same issue or who has overcome similar symptoms and problems to help me with advice, solutions, or possible causes. I don‚Äôt know if this has to do with the health of my gut microbiome. I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs related to any food intolerances. But most of my discomfort and symptoms seem to be located in the large intestine‚Äîin the colon.

Sometimes I even feel like gases accumulate throughout the day and I can‚Äôt release them unless I do light massages to help expel them. There are times when I don‚Äôt go to the bathroom frequently. I may go two or three days without a bowel movement, and then on the same day I might go once or twice. I don‚Äôt alternate between diarrhea and normal stools. My bowel movements are always normal and healthy from my point of view.

But again, I would like to find someone who has experienced this and knows how to overcome it. Thank you.",post,r/ChronicIllness,Health,3.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChronicIllness/comments/1kzk6gu/intestinos_y_gases/
"I dislike buying clothes now. I used to like buying clothes. It wasn't my favourite thing, but it was easy. Going to the thrift store and try stuff on? No problem. My body was slim. I had a sense of fashion. 

Fast forward to now, I have been trying to get new clothes online. It's been days. Items are in the shopping cart. But I don't buy anything, yet. 

And then I realised that I only buy those items because nowadays all my clothes look worn and I need to look decent when I go to a doctor's appointment or something. Online, I almost always miss my size. And I buy at the same place because I am tired of paying a shipping fee. So I opt for the cheapest, most functional stuff.

"Struggling to get by in life I've been having off and on GI/digestion issues for a few years now but my life has totally changed for the worse. Ever since late 2023, I haven't been able to eat anything without throwing up and or having severe pain and other symptoms, even liquids give me problems. Prior to this, I could basically eat or drink anything I wanted as long as it was early enough in the day and I didn't lay down after eating etc. Sometimes I had episodes of waking up with coughing choking, barfing and a burning feeling in my throat if I ate something my body didn't agree with. But now no matter what I eat/drink, I get severe nausea, vomiting, bloating, abdominal pain, throbbing, squeezing and tightness feeling in my stomach and lower left abdominal burning/cramping. My bowel movements are often very painful (but no blood) usually a mixture starting off with constipation at the beginning and ending with diarrhea and sometimes its either or. I have lost ‚Öì of my body weight since then, none of my old clothes fit, my face and skin is pale.
The pain and symptoms are so bad on somedays that I can't consume anything at all including water, I have to lay down all day staying completely still, no talking, no movement, no nothing at all to reduce the nausea and vomiting episodes. Everytime I goto the hospital or doctor they just send me home. They won't admit me.This has affected my quality of life so much that daily tasks are impossible for me to do now.

"Hi! Extremely similar case here, not only with me, but with my dtr, as well. I'm so sorry you were dismissed in that way. It's mind boggling to me that when a Dr doesn't know what it is that's wrong, that they will randomly blame everything on medication slide effects without addressing your concerns.

My dtr and I have random bouts of rapid heart rate (RHR), generally at rest. I don't feel mine. My visible armband picked it up. It explains why I am often exhausted for no reason. Mine goes up to 147 sometimes. My dtrs, on the other hand, will go into the 230s.

After full cardiac work ups, the Dr has said the condition is benign-- which we are both delighted to hear. We just want to know WHY these frequent bouts of RHR are ok.

"Suicidal Thoughts Hi everyone so i recently got diagnosed with chronic bronchitis due to vaping for majority of my life. Ever since I got diagnosed my world is gone upside down. I'm in pain and it feels like I'm alone.  I've learned a lot about this illness and I'm at a point where I'm like you know,  what I'm good.  I lived a good enough life.  I haven't Vaped for 4 days but today I picked it up again as I believe today will be my last so I don't really care.

"First things first, please don‚Äôt let this day be your last. I completely understand the desire and the impulse to make the pain go away, but life can still be beautiful with pain and hardship. 

I have psoriatic arthritis, so I‚Äôm in pain 24/7, and my energy/capability levels are about half of a healthy person‚Äôs. I‚Äôve had to stop eating gluten, start being active despite unbearable pain, and completely reshape how I go about my life since my diagnosis a year ago‚Äîbut my pain has been happening for much longer. 

It isn‚Äôt easy. It‚Äôs taken months for me to actually start pushing myself into being active, months to start an elimination diet, years to overcome being suicidal.

I had to find the smallest things to live for. The next beautiful sunrise or sunset. The next season change, the next time tomatoes would be in season or yellow mangoes would be going for 20¬¢ apiece. It was a conscious choice‚Äîand it continues to be‚Äîevery day. 

Now, I had help. I have a family who needs me around, and I take antidepressants for anxiety, OCD, depression and PTSD. If you need that support, get it, because it helps. 

After months and months of pushing and feeling like everything had stalled out and life was pointless for over a year, I finally got an amazing job that caters perfectly to my disability, and it has been an absolute game-changer to have achieved that. 

Set goals for yourself. You can vape tomorrow if you want, but never today. The catch is, it‚Äôs always today and never tomorrow, but the option is there if you‚Äôre scared. It‚Äôs possible pain management and condition improvement will happen if you stay away from vaping, but you‚Äôll never know just how amazing life could become if you cut it short too early.",comment_1,r/ChronicIllness,Health,,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChronicIllness/comments/1kz9zbr/suicidal_thoughts/

Good thing is you have your diagnosis and will find ways to help you to get better. That‚Äôs a good starting point. Look for things that make you forget your problme even for a brief moment.

"Hi. I've felt exactly like you, more than once, and I recently spent 9 days in the hospital as a result of suicidal ideation (having suicidal thoughts and a plan). I've had 5 hospitalizations over the past 23 years, since my car accident, because the depression gets too bad and I can't cope. I stopped myself from an attempt once, the rest I got in before I made the attempt, but I had the plans.

This is why I'm a big advocate for mental health treatment for individuals with chronic pain conditions and that the treatment should be separate from our pain treatment. What we need, mental health-wise , should not trying to be doing double duty for pain and depression,  I had that blow-up for me badly.  A psychiatrist, a doctor who specializes in these types of medicine, should be the one in charge of prescribing them.

If you feel like you are a harm to yourself, call 988 and speak to someone about getting some help.  
If you are worried about acting out on a plan, go to your local ER. Going to the ER for a mental health issue isn't always the most fun thing, but getting the help you need is important.

I've been in pain constant pain for 23 years, but I've still have wonderful experienced that I wouldn't give up. MY pain started at age 19 but I battled on and managed to get my 4 year BA in psychology. I worked for over a year at a group home for youth/kids with autism.

More recently, I've travelled several times by myself to conventions like Dragon\*Con in Atlanta and had a great time, visited New Orleans, when to Disneyworld (as an Adult), watched my sister & almost all my cousins get married, saw friend have babies, family members have babies (and became the book fairy to give them all books). Did some courses to keep me busy, volunteered, managed to work for the past 7 years (remote from home - taking a break now).

There is still life to live, even if you will have to deal with that challenge for the rest of your life. My pain involves my chest and does affect my breathing, so I understand more than you think.

I had this fear for a long time, especially with my endometriosis. I also had a hernia in that area which added to the worry!

"The ""she uses her health to manipulate the house"" brother saga, had come to a close. Context: first post was about how I overheard my brother say ""she uses her pain to manipulate the house"" to my mom. The second was my conversation confronting him about it. Here's how it went 

""What did you mean by 'grow up?'""

""I feel like there is a lot more you could be doing with your life in spite of your disabilities. I'm not discounting them and you have been made stronger because of them - but there are also a lot of people with similar conditions who have carved out niches in society and live productive independent lives. That's simply what i meant.
Maybe its your depression, i dont know, but i was simply calling attention to that""

""That in and of itself is discounting my disability. I was in the hospital twice this week ALONE. It's sad I feel like I have to explain this to you.""

""You wanted me to tell you so I did.
Don't get upset if you don't like the response.""

""Sorry you feel that way about me. I really honestly thought you felt higher about me.""

""It has nothing to do with ""higher"" or
""lower"" value
Don't twist it
If you think that someone could do things to improve their life that doesnt mean that you see them as
""lower"" value, in fact it shows you care about them cause if you didn't care you'd just write them off and ignore it.""

""I'm not trying to, that's just how I feel if someone says something not super nice about me.""

""Suggesting improvement is not 'not being nice'?  Again, twisting it. 

""I know you care about me I just honestly had no f*cking clue you felt this way about me because you never said until now. I'll try better, I'm sorry.""

""Not about doing it for me, it's for yourself (and the parentals too). It doesnt affect me but it does directly affect you which is why I feel the way i do about it.""

(I asked for examples of how to help and he said be the sole caregiver of my service dog, take sole care of my mom's chickens, do dishes, and housework)

""I'm just saying don't let the chronic pain take your life away.""

""It hasn't. I don't know how you could even say that. That really hurts that you think that.""

""It hurts that I think you could be making more of your life in spite of chronic pain?
""It hurts that my brother cares about me and wants me to life a good life""
Do you realize how backwards that sounds?
It's clear that you are not open to hearing stuff like this so it's probably best to just drop it. Again remember that YOU opened the door to this by hearing the conversation and then probing for answers behind them. You now have to live with the reality of what was revealed.""

""No, but that when you say something like that it makes me feel like you don't think my life is worth much. I guess you'd have to be in my position to see that.""

""How tf do you get that out of it.
That some major twisting.
Your life is valuable innately regardless of what you do with it
I'm not talking about value, l'm talking about fulfillment and purpose
What you fill your days with.""

""That's how I feel and you'd understand if you had what | have. My diseases make it harder to live or do basic things than the average person so in saying i could do more when I'm already trying my absolute best, can hurt. 
It's hard in situations like this because all I wanna know is if you're proud of me or think highly of me, or love me as much as I love you. It's hard because I think you mean well but it just doesn't come off that way unfortunately.""

""Why would any of that mean I don't love you as much, or aren't proud of you, or don't think highly of you?""

""The way things are worded. ""Grow up"" isn't loving, any way you say it. Or that I ""manipulate"" and stuff. I don't say that to you, even if you do it.""

""Well I didn't say that to you, you heard it in a conversation that wasn't for you. But I stand by what I said regardless.""

(I sent screenshots of him saying those things to me lol) ""those were said to me""

""It's true tho. You need to accept the consequences of your childish actions of snooping.""

""About this whole thing I've been only respectful and honest. Childish would be me saying you're a jerk or throwing a fit.""

""You have been pestering for a reply in messages for 2 days trying to get me to respond when I'm at events.
You have zero accountability for your actions.""

""I didn't have peace until you would explain yourself instead of using
""look internally"" or stuff like that. If I was asking, just outright say it and explain it to me so I can understand
""You have zero accountability for your actions.""
Neither have you had accountability.""

""And now I have. But you still aren't listening and trying to make it seem like I don't love you and am not proud of you. Accountability for doing what? Expressing concern for your life? Sorry for caring.""

""I never said you don't love me I said stuff like that makes me feel that way.""

""I do love you and I am proud of all you've gone through medically. You fight through a lot of pain daily, and I know it's not easy.""
(This was sweet until...)
""That doesn't change the fact of what ive said and how I think things could be improved.
I'm not just being mean or trying to hurt you‚Äî you're my only sister and my best friend, do you really think I'd be like ""yeah, let me insult her today.""

">I'm not discounting them and you have been made stronger because of them - but there are also a lot of people with similar conditions who have carved out niches in society and live productive independent lives.

I would be furious if I were you. This is the harm when disabled people who are successful try to twist the narrative against the ones who can't be. Disabilities are disabling. That's what makes them disabilities. Just because one disabled person seems perfectly fine and seems like they live a perfect life, it doesn't mean they do. Even if they did, no two persons are the same. What you experience will never be what I experience and vice versa.

I really love when people make content to spread awareness about disabilities, but people just end up thinking they're experts in it. It's like watching Molly Burke and pretending I know everything that comes with being blind.

"I had a medical appointment NOT for my disabilities or chronic illness, and it just turned into an appointment about my disabilities and chronic illness. I twisted my ankle last summer and it still hurts a little when I walk on it, so I just got referred to physical therapy. It‚Äôs the first ‚Äúnormal‚Äù uncomplicated medical appointment I‚Äôve had in a long time. Or so I thought. 

It was an initial evaluation we went through a ‚Äúquick‚Äù thing about ADLs and IADLs, and I can‚Äôt do a bunch of IADLs consistently or independently. So then we had to talk all about why I can‚Äôt do those things and why I have a caregiver and how much she comes per week and what exactly she does‚Ä¶ I had trouble answering because my autistic brain wasn‚Äôt expecting any of it and I was just stuck on what being unable to fold my own laundry has to with my sprained ankle. 

Then she tried to teach me to squat to pick something up off the floor because she said it would be better for my dizziness than bending (she is right about that.) But I also have balance issues and she had to dive after me to catch me when I fell over both times trying to squat. 

The whole thing was just awkward and unexpected. I felt more embarrassed and incompetent than I have in awhile. I mean, she even asked if going back to work is still one of my goals, when I literally just got approved for SSI. It‚Äôs technically a goal, but it‚Äôs so for off my radar at the moment. She said that we can‚Äôt completely separate out my ankle from the rest of me. I know she‚Äôs right, but it just‚Ä¶ didn‚Äôt feel good? 

Can anyone else relate to this happening? How do you handle it when it does?",post,r/ChronicIllness,Health,32.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChronicIllness/comments/1kyvdr3/i_had_a_medical_appointment_not_for_my/
"SO I dislocated my shoulder about a year ago while just sitting there and stretching. Same thing‚Äîa straightforward issue. I needed PT to 1) deal with the pain and tightness of compensating muscles from the injury and 2) address the root cause of the issue.

My first PT appointment was just like yours, including asking about goals. Turns out, I‚Äôm a bit hypermobile and we had to work on my back, neck, and gait cause I‚Äôve been holding my posture wrong for years, which ultimately caused chronic damage to my shoulder tendons and made the dislocation happen.

One of the reasons they ask about ADLs is honestly insurance. Insurance likes to see some kind of ‚Äúmeasurement‚Äù. üôÑ but it gave me a chance to tell them about my physical limits‚ÄîI was NOT an athlete with a sports injury. I needed them to take my limits into account when trying new exercises, AND I needed to speak up if something was hurting or too difficult. There is almost ALWAYS a modified exercise you can do if one is too difficult or just not comfortable for you (e.g. I hate laying down on the ground for sensory reasons, so we chose exercises that were standing or sitting).

She may have partially asked you to squat to see your ankle flexibility and ankle strength as well, squat form can tell a decent amount about how your skeleton likes to move. It‚Äôs normal to fail at an exercise (especially ones requiring balance!). In the future you can say ‚Äúokay that one hurt/I can‚Äôt do it again, can we do a different exercise?‚Äù Or similar.

I would encourage you to look at this as an opportunity to work out any musculoskeletal quirks you have that may be causing you pain. My pain levels throughout my entire body are lower and my QOL is higher thanks to PT.

They see everyone struggle physically, from young athletic people with sports injuries to geriatric people who fell and broke their hip. They are trained to ‚Äúpush‚Äù you gently in a safe and comfortable way, so they have to work with you to establish what is safe and comfortable for you.

My last tidbit would be to say that the goal of your appointments should be addressing anything that‚Äôs changed since last time and learning the proper form for exercises that will be your ‚Äúhomework.‚Äù It‚Äôs okay if you can‚Äôt bust out all of the reps of an exercise at once, at your appointment, but you should keep doing those exercises at home and you need to make sure you do them correctly when alone by learning at PT. Then, at home, you don‚Äôt have to do it all at once either. I would choose 1-2 exercises to do and do them while taking a little break from whatever I was working on. Basically I broke it up to be very spaced out at home so that everything was going at a comfortable pace.

PT is probably one of the specialists who was most understanding of my struggles and pivoted to what I needed best. I hope you can have a productive relationship with them as well! üíï",comment_1,r/ChronicIllness,Health,,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChronicIllness/comments/1kyvdr3/i_had_a_medical_appointment_not_for_my/
"I get it. Sometimes I want to forget about all my chronic issues and just be like a normal patient for once. Like when I started seeing my allergist I literally didn't tell her I have EDS because I figured it's unrelated and like for once this is a simple common issue. Allergies. Nope. I have MCAS a condition related to allergies and comorbid with the EDS. Turns out my allergist really needed to know about the EDS and was annoyed when she found I hid it because I didn't think it was relevant.

It sucks. However your pt is sadly right, which probably means they're a good pt. We can't separate your ankle from the rest of your body. Things like how you stand and bend which comes into play when doing your activities of daily living are going to affect your ankle. Also hey, it's probably best to get PT for all your issues instead of just the ankle. So it's kind of nice they're willing to treat all of you because some aren't.

Hopefully the questions about your adls and returning to work she wasn't asking to judge you just to understand your goals for PT. It's part of PT is they have to have tangible goals they're trying to achieve with the patient. Like insurance won't cover PT without this. It also means they can tailor it to what's important to the patient. If going back to work isn't a realistic goal for you then YOUR PT shouldn't be focused on trying to get you there.

My mom also attended several conference and info sessions about applying for SSI for autism and she learned the best way to phrase things on paperwork and the kinds of information that social security needs to make their determination (to be clear, we didn‚Äôt try to game the system or put anything that wasn‚Äôt true on paperwork. My mom just learned how to phrase things to best highlight the many facets of my disabilities.) Because of all my mom‚Äôs work I was approved without needing to appeal. My mom and I still have to bring in both our birth certificates for me to officially start getting payments though. (my mom was appointed my representative payee because apparently SSA doesn‚Äôt think I‚Äôm capable of managing my own money.

"I have a mental disorder I can‚Äôt figure out. I‚Äôm 32M. This is very embarrassing to discuss cause I don‚Äôt want to be in a padded room. This is going to be a jumbled mess so y‚Äôall know it‚Äôs the ADHD. Lol (What I am about to explain may be a symptom of that). I thought maybe it‚Äôs a form of Maladaptive day dreaming or maybe Hyperphasia. Idk. But maybe others have experienced it and can give me some advice. 

Since I was a kid I have always done this thing where I put my hands together and I shake my body and some how I can almost imagine whatever I‚Äôm thinking or seeing is real. Example: Today I was online and I saw a pair of glasses and I was like ‚Äúthose are nice glasses‚Äù they were expensive so I thought ‚Äúwhat kind of lenses are those‚Äù and then I thought ‚ÄúI wish I could afford those and have the best quality lenses for my glasses‚Äù and then I intentionally unintentionally put my hands together and shook my body and just like that I got the gratification of owning those glasses without actually having them. 

I‚Äôve done the same for anime fighting scenes, seeing cars I want, houses I want, jobs I want. I don‚Äôt know how to explain this and I have been searching online for answers so I can stop. It‚Äôs causing me to be content and stops me from pursuing those goals because I have already felt what it‚Äôs like to have it. Its destroyed my life.

"Diagnosis doesn‚Äôt change anything but knowing how to treat it. It gives you tools, resources, and empowerment. I know it‚Äôs incredibly daunting to receive a serious diagnosis, and you are allowed to feel upset. It feels unfair, like it‚Äôll never end, etc. 

Receiving treatment will only help you. You may even be able to go into remission. Even with bipolar, which is a lifelong condition, many people are able to live happy and fulfilling lives with the correct medication. 

In my opinion, a diagnosis is the first step in feeling better. It gives you some semblance of control again, validation even. What‚Äôs even greater is the vast amount of tools at your disposal now. Knowing what is going on in your brain allows you to take back that power. Instead of your mental health controlling you, you can start controlling it. Because now you can learn how to help it. 

And one more thing. Mental illness does not define who YOU are as a person. It doesn‚Äôt mean you aren‚Äôt worthy of love from yourself or anyone around you. You go up from here, friend‚ù§Ô∏è",comment_1,r/mentalillness,Health,,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalillness/comments/1kzmnoe/whats_it_like_getting_diagnosed_with_a_serious/
"It isn‚Äôt hopeless. It definitely CAN and WILL feel that way at times, but that is simply a distortion of reality. I have type 1 bipolar and borderline personality disorder, so I know first hand what it‚Äôs like to live with bipolar and a personality disorder. Shitty mental health issues to have. I have felt utterly hopeless more times than I can count and I‚Äôm sure there will be times in the future that I will feel that way again. It‚Äôs a harder life.

Don‚Äôt be like me and live in denial about being mentally ill. It only made things way way worse for me in the long run. The sooner you accept it the better. The sooner you accept it the sooner you will start feeling less and less ashamed about it. The sooner you accept it the sooner you will find the right medication and therapies to manage your illnesses. The sooner you accept it the sooner you will figure out what you need to do to manage your life. My personal messages are open to you if you need someone to talk to further.

Best thing I can say is take things one step at a time. Try not to let yourself feel too overwhelmed by any new info you get, but also make sure to actively seek out info. I pushed my diagnoses to the side and lived in denial for quite a while and it did more harm than good. Once I started to educate myself on bipolar disorder and BPD, I actually for once saw improvements in my mental health because I now had insight on how my mental illnesses worked and how I could take charge over them. Psycho-education is power. A lot of doctors will just slap a diagnosis or two on you and hand you medication without telling you what the diagnosis actually means. Go search out credible sources for educational materials and therapies to help your situation. The more you educate yourself on your conditions the more tools that you will have to manage it and take care of yourself.",comment_2,r/mentalillness,Health,,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalillness/comments/1kzmnoe/whats_it_like_getting_diagnosed_with_a_serious/

i have never gone to get diagnosed with anything, but i know for sure that i have anxiety, that‚Äôs something i‚Äôve dealt with all my life and it‚Äôs something my mother also deals with a lot of times. but, it‚Äôs way more than that. i often feel like i‚Äôm stuck in a body i shouldnt be in, in a life i shouldnt have. i tell myself all the time that i want to die, that i should just end everything or even just find a way to leave everything in this life behind. i have a pretty bad eating disorder that absolutely no one knows about, i‚Äôm not seeking help right now either. i feel so drained lately and it‚Äôs weird because whenever i‚Äôm around other people i‚Äôm not like this. i‚Äôm usually happy, outgoing, talkative. so whenever i‚Äôm alone and just sitting with my own thoughts i end up crying a lot, i feel like i‚Äôm spiraling and i feel like i just hate everything and anything about myself and i constantly beg for a different life even though i know nothing is going to change. my emotions are very wishy-washy, one moment i can be very happy, the next extremely annoyed, or say someone says something that makes me feel invalidated or unwanted, then i get so angry and upset that i really can‚Äôt control myself. i self harm regularly, cutting, hitting things, tearing things up, hitting myself. i cry so much every day, almost every hour. i don‚Äôt even feel like myself even though no one else can see it, or see that i have any issues. i‚Äôm such an anger filled person and i hate it. 

i often struggle with derealization as well, and it can get extremely bad at times. and typically, i‚Äôd feel terrible even being slightly rude to people, but lately, i‚Äôve been acting so differently. i‚Äôve been treating people badly, i don‚Äôt care about how anybody else feels and in the moment i always feel like it‚Äôs the right thing to do because at the end of the day, no one truly cares about me or how i feel. i‚Äôm just an unlovable piece of shit.

it‚Äôs not like i romanticize bad mental health or anything, and i guess i feel like seeing how my friend‚Äî who has been through a lot and has an actual reason to have mental problems‚Äî has made me feel like i shouldnt be feeling any sort of way because my life isn‚Äôt anything like hers. i haven‚Äôt been through the traumatic experiences she has, so what makes me feel like i can feel this way? any time i‚Äôm crying, any time i‚Äôm angry at the flip of a switch, any time i get those bad thoughts inside of my head, i start to think, maybe i‚Äôm just doing this all for attention. even though i never talk to anybody about how i feel, or what i do. i just always think to myself that i‚Äôm doing this to make it seem like i have issues, or i‚Äôm doing this just because. i don‚Äôt know, i think everything in my brain is just extremely muddled right now. i feel like i‚Äôm being dramatic. i feel like my feelings aren‚Äôt valid because what have i truly gone through to be able to feel this way? i also often wonder if i am bipolar. but i always put that thought aside because the friend that i brought up is bipolar, so it makes me feel like i‚Äôm just copying her, or something. or i don‚Äôt know what it‚Äôs actually like. i don‚Äôt know, no one is in my brain and no one can fully understand how i feel and what i think, and i hate opening up to people and talking to them about my feelings, and maybe that‚Äôs part of the problem too, i don‚Äôt really know.

but, if you‚Äôve read all of this, i just want to thank you, for hearing me out, for trying to help. this is the first time i‚Äôve ever spoken about how i feel and it‚Äôs on reddit. can you imagine how stupid i must seem lol. okay bye.",post,r/mentalillness,Health,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalillness/comments/1kzz6o1/am_i_mentally_ill_or_just_seeking_attention_tw/

It fluctuates so sometimes Im golden and other times Im locking myself in the bathroom because I think people are out to get me. Im working right now as well as studying to pass my ged (I dropped out of high school for medical reasons and not being able to attend) and I think I might or might have lost/lose my best friend. Im also very numb emotionally and Im zoned out most of the day. Ive had issues with distraction and have suspected I have adhd for a while. Im constantly making dangerous mistakes because of it like leaving the iron on all day while I'm at work and making reckless turns while driving. I experienced something very jarring last week, I got to work and saw my coworker (who got fired like a month ago) I said hi and we exchanged how are you's. I walked past said coworker to my other coworker and talked about how I didn't know she was back and had thought she'd been let go. I was met with a confused look and was told that she was fired and no she didn't come back. I looked behind me and she was gone and I didn't see her the rest of the day of course because she wasnt there. Ive never experienced anything like that before. My brain somehow fabricated an entire 10 second encounter with someone who didnt exist, at least not in that space. Ive been feeling very paranoid as well recently and all of these symptoms are pointing me in a direction I dont want to go in. I have a therapist who I stopped seeing for like 3 weeks because of own distraction and forgetfulness that caused me to stall making my appointments so now my therapy is ending in 4 weeks. Thats my own fault but I dont think I have the funds or mental capacity to go out hunting for a new one, especially with how hard it is getting mental health help in my state. I most definitely cannot afford to be in a mental hospital nor do I want to but Im afraid I will spiral. I feel like Im in desperate need of a vacation but not only do I not have the money for it, but any money I do make needs to go towards paying debt and medication costs. My new prescription is 400 bucks out of pocket and ofc my insurance wont cover it. I keep telling myself that all of this is because of my age and I will mellow out as I get older but as of right now Im exhausted and I feel like a car going 120mph with the radio on and the AC blasting and the gas tank on empty. I don't really have anyone to talk to anymore so any advice helps. Im afraid I might accidentally fuck something up big time just because of how ""out of it"" I am.

I was actually raped a few times when I was a teen, and molested plenty as a child, now in my mid 20‚Äôs I reflect on a lot of things I thought and things I did then because of my trauma. The best thing you could do is go to therapy, find a therapist that specializes in aggression, and intrusive thoughts.

"I am a stalker / delusional. Does anyone have advice In my life I develop severe delusions towards close female friends. When the friendships end I develop stalking behaviour (sending them letters, walking by their house daily, watching them...). I am diagnosed with schizoid personality disorder, dysthymia and delusional disorder.

I was in both in a mental hospital for this in 2020 & 2022 and did talk-therapy from 2021-2025. I am on Effexor; and in theory I should be taking Seroquel, but I don't because the side effects (I am a fat zombie while taking it) are  too much. I asked for a different prescription as there are antipsychotics without drowsiness and weight gain as side effects, but by doctor refuses.

Talk therapy helped me a lot but the core issue still exists. A few months ago I started stalking again and as I saw myself get in this situation I immediately moved long distance. This was a really good idea because I can't physically stalk her so it protects her from me (and myself from more legal issues), but doesn't solve the core issue; I still think about her 24/7, I am still mentally unwell. I feel defeated, and that I can't escape the cycle of stalking people. The only thing that helps me is forming new close friendships; but this is just a continuation of the cycle as I will inevitable stalk them in the future.

The only thing I haven't tried is getting a pet. Maybe I can form a close bond with a pet? And for obvious reasons it is impossible to stalk your own dog? But my mind isn't well right now, as my last victim had a dog so I am unsure if my wish for a dog is real or just a ""If I have a dog like hers, I have a part of her with me"". If that makes sense to you.

I would suggest getting a pet that isn't a dog. I feel like a dog would help you stalk even more since you have to go walk them and it could be an excuse if you get caught. So a pet that strictly stays indoors like a reptile or a fish.,comment_1,r/mentalillness,Health,,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalillness/comments/1kzswxe/i_am_a_stalker_delusional_does_anyone_have_advice/

"Someone please tell me what happened. I think I may actually be insane. One night, I was playing a video game Honkai: Star Rail. I started a quest called ‚ÄúVessel of Mediocrity,‚Äù which started out normal, but the music in the background made it strange. The track is called ‚ÄúFrosty Trail.‚Äù Right after I finished the first part of the quest, I for some reason looked up the lore of the quest on fandom and cried. It was a very sad story, but I had never cried harder in my life, even when my dog died. You can look up the story of the quest if you want, but it‚Äôs basically about a girl who was manipulated her whole life and then killed because people misunderstood her. That song that was playing made it so much more impactful for some reason. After I read the details and heard the song again and again because I had left the game on, I went outside a screamed and cried for hours. I felt like I had just had the most important person in my life torn away from me. I laid on the wet grass despite my OCD, and cried until I could barely breathe. I looked at the sky and begged for it to bring her back. I‚Äôm only 16, and this happened a few months ago. All I know I have is OCD, Depression, Level 1 Autism, ADHD, and most likely PTSD. I genuinely want to know why this happened to me. It felt like I was a completely different person. I couldn‚Äôt even speak normally for days. My soul was crushed in that moment. I feel better now, like something like that never would have been possible for me, but every time I hear that song or go to that map in the game, I feel it. I feel some sort of connection to it. I‚Äôve always been interested in snowy, cold places. T another song that makes me feel strange is  ‚ÄúCold Light‚Äù from the attack on titan soundtrack. Something about these songs and places makes me feel something I can‚Äôt describe easily. It‚Äôs like a feeling of longing, melancholy, and fear. I doubt I‚Äôll ever cry that much again, even when my parents die.

"Finishing my course I'm really stressed out recently,  currently working 47 hours, cycling there and back almost every day of the week, and I'm nearing the end of my coursework, I've been lying to my parents about how far behind I am with coursework. A lot of the tasks I have should have been due yesterday. 

They aren't even that hard I just feel irritated, it doesn't help that recently I've been drinking a lot lately, I havent talked to anyone apart from family outside of work in a year and having a lot of caffiene I feel really on edge and overwhelmed. I know I have time today to work on it but having a conversation with my mum is so draining at times. 

She offered for me to come with her to the allotment for a few hours, but when I declined she said ""of course you'd say that, my job is to offer and yours is to decline"". I'm just so sick of being guilt tripped I can tell that she just wants it her way.

But she's constantly pressuring me to finish my course, It feels like I don't know what the hell she wants from me sometimes, I went to my room and stuck with my answer. It feels irritating that I'd love to go if I could but this is my only chance now today but that conversation just made me angry and upset and I can't even focus on this crap anymore she said ""it'll only be a few hours your over-reacting it won't make that much of a difference"".

"My sister can‚Äôt take care of herself and she refuses help I don‚Äôt really know what I want from this post, other than to get it out of my system. It‚Äôs about my sister. I love her, but I‚Äôm also exhausted, frustrated, and heartbroken over how her life looks, and how little anyone seems to be able to do to change it.

She‚Äôs always struggled with things most people eventually figure out: basic hygiene, cleaning, eating properly, managing money, having any sort of structure. Even as a kid, it showed, she wouldn‚Äôt shower, she ate mostly junk, her room was always a mess. But back then there were adults around who could step in and help.

Once she moved out, everything fell apart quickly. She missed rent payments, ignored bills, got evicted from multiple apartments, isolated herself completely. She just... shut down.

In her early twenties, she developed a substance abuse problem. That was one of the hardest periods in our family. She‚Äôs clean now, and I‚Äôm so grateful for that. But even after she got sober, nothing else really got better. She rarely leaves the house. Her home is a health hazard, dirty, smelly, full of trash and old food. She barely showers, sleeps odd hours, doesn‚Äôt eat real meals. There‚Äôs no routine, no order.

My family has tried everything we can think of. Offering help with cleaning, money, going with her to the doctor, helping her get in touch with social services or mental health support. But she always refuses. She says she‚Äôs fine, that she‚Äôll get things under control soon. But she never does. Nothing changes.

And I carry this huge sense of guilt. For ""abandoning"" her, I know that‚Äôs not really what happened, but it feels that way sometimes. I moved to another city a few years ago. I built a life here: a stable relationship, a job, a home that functions. And she‚Äôs still stuck. Still barely surviving.

I know I have the right to live my own life, and that I can‚Äôt fix hers for her. But it hurts. It hurts that I got out and she didn‚Äôt. That I get to enjoy small, everyday things, grocery shopping, walks with my partner, making dinner, while she‚Äôs curled up in a messy apartment not brushing her teeth.

Sometimes it feels like we‚Äôre living on different planets. I know she‚Äôs suffering. I know there‚Äôs probably a lot of untreated mental illness beneath the surface. But when someone doesn‚Äôt want to talk about it, doesn‚Äôt want help, doesn‚Äôt even acknowledge the situation, what can you do? How long do you keep trying before you burn out too?

I‚Äôm just tired. And sad. I feel like a bad sister for not doing more, but every time I try, she pushes me away.

It hurts to love someone who doesn‚Äôt seem able to receive that love.",post,r/mentalillness,Health,10.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalillness/comments/1kzewxm/my_sister_cant_take_care_of_herself_and_she/
"This sounds like untreated ADHD, untreated ADHD can cause other mental health issues leading to the big mess there is now. 

Struggling to eat healthy, manage hygiene, manage money, no structure, messy room/house, substance issues,  no routine ect ect are all contributing things that can be caused by untreated ADHD

They can go to court over it to gain rights to her medical care. There's plenty of proof backing up their claim so it will be a fairly straightforward case.

"I don't understand why I was admitted alongside my friend My neighbours called for a wellness check because my friend was screaming and smashing objects. But for some reason, the authorities took me to the hospital alongside my friend. He is still detained, but I was released after a few days and asked to do regular therapy.

I don't think I was a danger to myself or others. Maybe I'm in denial, so that's why I'm asking for an outside perspective.

I've dealt with moderate depression and anxiety in the past, but I don't think more than many Gen Z. Before being hospitalised, my lowest point was spending 48 hours in bed during university. I am diagnosed with Autism, ADHD and OCD, if that's relevant.

I live alone in a flat and have a mid-income. When my friend got disowned by his family due to his alcoholism, it consumed my life to stop him from becoming homeless. I've known him since childhood, so I felt obligated.

I spoke to him for hours, got calls at odd hours and cancelled plans. I got fired from my job due to lateness and leaving shifts early. Thankfully, I have savings to live off. My friend made a mess out of my flat, letting dishes pile up and not taking out the bins. Soon, I gave up cleaning after him and became pretty unkempt myself.

My friend promised me he wouldn't bring his alcoholism into my space. However, I slipped up several times. When he got drunk with me, he got pretty aggressive, even if he didn't hit me. He tended to lock himself in his room, rambling and bruising his arms as he hit things.

Finally, he got too loud and the neighbours called the police. When they saw how ragged my friend's arms were, they quickly escorted him away. Afterwards, the officers interviewed me. They questioned the scattered rubbish everywhere, so I had to confess to losing my job, struggling to clean and cooking for myself. After they heard that, the officers told me I needed to come with them, too.

I got admitted to the mental hospital but the doctors dismissed me when I agreed to a care plan of weekly therapy. I'm back in my flat and I'm still baffled why I was admitted. My mental health isn't good, but was I really a danger to myself or others?

"Not sure how the stem m system works in England, so your mileage may vary.

My first thought is that they may not have thought you were putting yourself or anyone else in danger but it may have seemed evident to them that you needed treatment and so maybe it was a voluntary admittance, even if they worded it that they strongly encouraged you to check yourself in. In the USA, even if it is a voluntary admittance, the docs still have to clear you to leave. These are pretty short stays so I tend to think this may be what happened.

If it wasn‚Äôt a voluntary admittance, you may have said or showed something that made them conclude there was danger, this could include dangerous conditions in your home",comment_1,r/mentalillness,Health,,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalillness/comments/1kzdof3/i_dont_understand_why_i_was_admitted_alongside_my/

"Advice I posted this in the r/advice subreddit too but I thought maybe someone here might have insight.

Me(F) & my ex boyfriend broke up around 6-7 months ago, we kept seeing each other up until about 4 months ago and the breakup wasn‚Äôt messy just super hard for both of us and we literally could not be together, not because of anything I‚Äôm saying here it‚Äôs because of other things but I was the one who broke up with him. In 2023 I tried to kill myself, I distanced from him and we didn‚Äôt talk again for 2 months. After that things were going great, he is honestly an amazing guy and is truly better than anyone I have ever met. In April of 2024 I went on new medications since I had been trying different ones since my attempt. I know I shouldn‚Äôt blame the medicine but I feel like I truly went crazy when I was on those pills, I would scream at him, cuss him out, tell him awful things and just treat him terribly any time I was upset, (I had always struggled with mood swings but not to this extent) throughout this he was so sweet and gentle to me, no matter what he didn‚Äôt say anything mean and would just remind me he loves me & be so so sweet, I was really awful I would even hit him and he would have bruises, and once even a bump next to his eye (that was from me but was from an accident I did not mean to hurt his face), he didn‚Äôt care about that either he would just laugh it off but when we talked after the breakup I realized how much he hated it then, which it should have been obvious I know. Anyway since then I have gotten so much better, I don‚Äôt want to sound cocky but I am such a kinder person and so caring and loving & I‚Äôve been told by so many people around me how much I changed for the better, I feel absolutely awful for how I treated him and can‚Äôt even imagine being like that now, I can‚Äôt even remember stuff I did unless I read old texts or look at old photos. I don‚Äôt know what was wrong with me or what might still be wrong with me but I know I‚Äôm better now and I know I can never show him that no matter how much I love him and want to be with him. How do I get over this feeling knowing he did nothing wrong and I was completely the problem? I know I don‚Äôt deserve to feel better & I understand if I get mean comments, I would be mean to me too I don‚Äôt know why I‚Äôm doing this. I just want to figure out how to move on knowing it was completely my fault our relationship had bad parts and I completely ruined his perception of love. How do I get over guilt? I immediately changed going off of those pills & getting better ones and it just feels like the better version of me is feeling all the guilt the worst version of me should have gotten",post,r/mentalillness,Health,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalillness/comments/1kzn8jf/advice/
"what I hate most about social anxiety people don't understand it at all. everytime I feel like I have to explain myself when I don't want to do certain things because I know they would make me very uncomfortable and anxious and would probably trigger a depressive episode. like why can't people just accept that I don't wanna do certain things? if someone who's scared of height doesn't wanna go bungee jumping people accept it without questioning anything, so why can't they do the same with people who have social anxiety and don't wanna do things that include interacting with strangers (for example) ?

"Mental Illness Survival Pack ‚Äî Raw Truth, Real Strategies, and Grounded Motivation 
PART 1: CRITICAL FACTS PEOPLE WITH MENTAL ILLNESS NEED TO KNOW
	1.	Your brain isn‚Äôt broken ‚Äî it‚Äôs reacting to pain, trauma, and stress.
Survival patterns become chronic when never interrupted. Mental illness is often a defense, not a defect.
	2.	High intelligence and neurodivergence increase risk for anxiety, depression, and existential spirals.
Statistically, gifted and divergent individuals struggle more with mood regulation, sensory overload, and burnout.
	3.	Medication is a tool, not a cure.
It can help regulate symptoms, but healing requires behavioral change, support systems, and nervous system work.
	4.	Your nervous system needs re-regulation, not motivation.
Grounding, breathwork, and cold exposure aren‚Äôt pseudoscience ‚Äî they recalibrate the brain-body loop.
	5.	Blood sugar, sleep, and gut health impact your mental state more than most realize.
If your body‚Äôs in crisis, your brain will be too.
	6.	Emotional trauma rewires logic.
The feeling of being ‚Äútoo much,‚Äù ‚Äúnot enough,‚Äù or ‚Äúunsafe‚Äù is often programmed, not true.
	7.	Relapse isn‚Äôt failure. It‚Äôs a feedback system.
Progress includes backward steps. It‚Äôs not linear.
	8.	You are not lazy. You are burnt out from surviving your own internal chaos.
	9.	Mental illness is a full-body condition ‚Äî not just a mood or attitude.
	10.	You are not alone, but your experience is uniquely valid.
Never let anyone dismiss your symptoms as weakness or drama.

‚∏ª

PART 2: SCIENCE-BACKED STRATEGIES TO MANAGE IT DAILY

ADHD / Autism / Executive Dysfunction
	‚Ä¢	Notion or similar planner app: Compensates for working memory gaps.
	‚Ä¢	Pomodoro timer: Boosts dopamine through urgency.
	‚Ä¢	Brain.fm / Endel: Brainwave syncing music improves attention by up to 200%.

RSD & Emotional Overload
	‚Ä¢	Mood journaling apps (Daylio, Moodnotes): Objectify emotional spirals before reacting.
	‚Ä¢	TIPP (cold water + intense movement): Proven to lower cortisol and emotional flooding.

Anxiety, Shutdown, Panic
	‚Ä¢	5-4-3-2-1 grounding: Activates sensory focus; shuts down spirals.
	‚Ä¢	Insight Timer or Bearable: Tracks emotional/physical patterns for better control.

Eating Disorder & Sensory Support
	‚Ä¢	Bento-style meals / small safe snacks: Avoids overwhelm, supports regulated intake.
	‚Ä¢	Virtual mealtime support: Social eating reduces food guilt and fear.

Gut-Brain Fixes
	‚Ä¢	Fermented foods: Sauerkraut, kefir, miso ‚Äî proven to improve microbiome diversity.
	‚Ä¢	Prebiotics: Garlic, leeks, oats feed good bacteria.
	‚Ä¢	Remove triggers: Cut seed oils, artificial sweeteners, excess sugar.
	‚Ä¢	Stress = gut damage: Use breathwork, sleep, and minerals to heal the gut barrier.

‚∏ª

PART 3: NO-BULLSHIT MOTIVATIONAL QUOTES
	1.	‚ÄúYour nervous system isn‚Äôt broken ‚Äî it‚Äôs exhausted from keeping you alive.‚Äù
	2.	‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not a problem to solve. You‚Äôre a person to understand.‚Äù
	3.	‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not about doing more ‚Äî it‚Äôs about doing less of what hurts you.‚Äù
	4.	‚ÄúYou‚Äôve survived 100% of your worst days so far.‚Äù
	5.	‚ÄúHealing means pain loses control, not that pain disappears.‚Äù
	6.	‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not behind ‚Äî your brain made a timeline to protect you.‚Äù
	7.	‚ÄúBrushing your teeth is resistance. That‚Äôs enough sometimes.‚Äù
	8.	‚ÄúRest is not laziness. It‚Äôs rebellion in a system built to break you.‚Äù
	9.	‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt need to feel better to start. You need to start feeling.‚Äù
	10.	‚ÄúSurvival counts. Always.‚Äù

‚∏ª

PART 4: REAL-WORLD STRATEGIES FOR SURVIVAL + FUNCTIONALITY (Beyond Coping)

For Low-Energy Days / Depression Shutdowns
	‚Ä¢	Behavioral Activation (BA): Small actions lead to momentum.
	‚Ä¢	Brush teeth = win.
	‚Ä¢	Sit by the window = win.
	‚Ä¢	Put on clean clothes = win.
	‚Ä¢	Use task randomizers like GoblinTools or ‚ÄúSpin The Wheel‚Äù apps to bypass decision fatigue.
	‚Ä¢	Anti-meltdown environments: Set up a ‚Äúcrash zone‚Äù with fidgets, blankets, blue light, and calming sounds in advance.

‚∏ª

For Executive Dysfunction + ADHD Paralysis
	‚Ä¢	Micro-stacking: Break a task into <30 sec actions. Don‚Äôt say ‚Äúclean room‚Äù ‚Äî say ‚Äúthrow away this one cup.‚Äù
	‚Ä¢	Body doubling: Use livestreams, Discord focus rooms, or YouTube Pomodoro study-with-me videos.
	‚Ä¢	‚ÄúFirst Minute Rule‚Äù: You only commit to doing a task for 1 minute. No pressure after that. Usually, you‚Äôll keep going.

‚∏ª

For Eating Disorders (especially with autistic or trauma overlap)
	‚Ä¢	No-stimulation meals: Avoid loud, bright, chaotic environments while eating. Sensory overload can block hunger cues.
	‚Ä¢	Safe texture kits: Create a list of ‚Äúdefault foods‚Äù that never fail, even on meltdown days (e.g., rice crackers, banana, plain broth).
	‚Ä¢	Chewable magnesium / trace mineral drinks: Helps hunger signaling and digestion for those with food aversions or ED-related anxiety.

‚∏ª

For Sleep Disruption (high in ADHD, anxiety, autism, and trauma)
	‚Ä¢	Weighted blanket (5‚Äì10% body weight) = deeper sleep, reduced cortisol
	‚Ä¢	Magnesium glycinate or taurinate = helps GABA production for natural sedation
	‚Ä¢	Blue light block mode 2 hrs before bed = boosts melatonin by up to 300%

‚∏ª

For Anger, Rage, or Sensory Overload
	‚Ä¢	Hand grip tools or ice cube squeeze method: Discharges adrenaline safely
	‚Ä¢	Safe ‚Äúrage rituals‚Äù:
	‚Ä¢	Scream into pillow
	‚Ä¢	Smash ice in the tub
	‚Ä¢	Punch mattress
	‚Ä¢	30-second rule: Rage peaks chemically at 30 seconds. If you can survive that window, the wave starts to crash.

‚∏ª

PART 5: REFRAMES YOU NEED TO REMEMBER
	‚Ä¢	Productivity is not morality
You‚Äôre not worth less because you‚Äôre not ‚Äúoutputting.‚Äù
	‚Ä¢	Crying is nervous system detox
It releases built-up stress hormones. Suppression leads to shutdown.
	‚Ä¢	Comparison is delusion
You‚Äôre comparing someone‚Äôs highlight reel to your emergency broadcast.
	‚Ä¢	You‚Äôre allowed to stop trying to be ‚Äúnormal‚Äù
If the world was built to erase your difference, why keep pleasing it?

"Do I have an eating disorder or am I just being over the top with my diet? 
I was 86kg 160 cm tall 33f. I began by losing weight with Ozempic in September last year. After 2 months didn‚Äôt wanna continue that.

About two months ago I started to restrict my carb and sugar intake much more than usual and used about 30 or so laxatives a week.

I‚Äôve started a new job with long hours and found power in not allowing myself to eat anything until dinner and if I did eat lunch, I would restrict dinner, laxative usage has increased to about 50 a week.


I think I am getting high off the control and seeing the weight drop but am dubious this is an eating disorder as I am 67kg.

I am due to be married in less than two weeks and I could be feeling stressed about it? I have seen a doctor who says I have high anxiety and had organised for me to see a psychiatrist.

I‚Äôm unsure about this.

I haven‚Äôt mentioned this to the doctor as again I‚Äôm still doubtful it‚Äôs anything substantial but thought I‚Äôd ask nonetheless.",post,r/mentalillness,Health,2.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalillness/comments/1kz1vv1/do_i_have_an_eating_disorder_or_am_i_just_being/
"I think the psychiatrist could be a very big help. Having a restricted diet is okay in some settings, but when taken to an extreme can be very dangerous for your health (mentally and physically). I‚Äôm not a diagnostician, but your description of your habits above are consistent with an eating disorder. Know you‚Äôre not alone. 
Many of us have used *food* for comfort, often over- indulging or intensely restricting because it‚Äôs one aspect of our lives that we can have total control over. Which is why many of us with anxiety, mental disorders have some level of eating disorders. 
Developing a healthy relationship with food can be difficult. Society put a lot of pressure on everyone to be better, prettier, and to meet unobtainable standards. Hopefully, by working with a therapist, you can learn new coping mechanisms, set healthy boundaries, and gain a sense of personal control. It‚Äôs hard work and might hurt a little (feelings can suck), but gets easier over time.

I think you probably know that you should tell a doctor - and perhaps you‚Äôre trying to justify keeping it a secret by saying ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not sure this is an ED or anything serious‚Äù. But if you‚Äôre addicted to laxatives or restricting food intake and self medicating I think it‚Äôs clear that your relationship with food and your body is not healthy/normal. 

Please be honest with your docs. They want to help you and will help you assess what‚Äôs going on and how you could manage symptoms. EDs are life threatening.

"I have no idea what's wrong with me. I know something is wrong with me but the thing is I'm stuck. You see I'm in this constant state of confusion with myself. It's like I don't even know myself, idk how I feel, idk my personality, idk my behavior, etc. I know what my interests and hobbys are, but that's about it really.
I constantly try to get people to say what their impression of me is but I always get a lack of response and it frustrates me. Apparently I weird people out too but I don't even do anything that would make sense to be weirded out by or at least it's something I don't notice. I know I do with people I know but that's different. 
But what I do know is I have to suffer from something. I sometimes think its not that serious but then I remember about the period of time where I was scared of doing anything even something like just opening a door I was afraid everything I did was bad, for context I ""overdosed"" (I put this in quotations bc it turned out what I took didn't rlly do much at all) over an online relationship that only lasted 4 months when I was 15 bc she ""cheated"" on me with 2 people (trust me this is just really chronically online and stupid), teenage drama type of stuff but for whatever reason I took it far and did that bc I wanted her attention or something. While I was in the hospital & I was crying my mom told me that I was selfish bc I didn't want her to leave but she had work the next day and was like you did it to yourself, which she's right but idk that just seems like something you shouldn't say. 
This was awhile ago though and when I was younger but I had a falling out with a friend group recently and I had that same urge to do something bad to myself to make them feel bad. I didn't even know these people for that long, and its not like they're innocent or anything but idk.
Like I know I'm for sure depressed that's obvious but it definitely feels like there has to be something else, but I really don't know, I don't do much, I don't drive, nor do I talk to a lot of people. I don't have much interaction in general so I'm just stuck in my room not knowing what to do other than draw. 
Sometimes I feel depressed but other times I feel fine.
I get upset when the attention isn't on me & I get upset when I'm left alone. I complain about not having friends but when I do get them I kinda just distance myself, I don't even try texting most of the time, I wait for the other to text me.

A lot of what I said is just the tip of the iceberg, I've went through a lot of childhood trauma before that and was raised by a neglectful mom.

"Am i schizophrenic I‚Äôve been experiencing hallucinations for about 15 years now it started when I was four. At first, it wasn‚Äôt too bad. I would just see things that were already on my mind, like thoughts taking visual form. But as I grew older, especially during high school, it started getting worse. I learned more about life and reality, and the hallucinations became scarier and harder to deal with. Recently, it got so overwhelming that I ended up sleeping for 14 days straightI was just too scared and exhausted to function. That‚Äôs when my parents took me to see a doctor. The doctor asked if I might have a mental illness, but I denied it because I‚Äôve read posts saying that mental illnesses can make you feel constantly tired, unable to do basic things, and I‚Äôm terrified of being put in a mental hospital. Now I‚Äôm not sure what to do. Part of me wants to open up and get help, but I‚Äôm scared of being judged or labeled a ‚Äúfreak‚Äù by my friends. I‚Äôve tried my best to hide it all these years, but I don‚Äôt think I can keep doing that anymore.

"That sounds incredibly tough and scary... a panic attack going on for hours with your heart pounding like that, headaches and feeling so warm is a lot to handle.

First, try to focus on your breathing. Slow it down if you can... maybe a 4-count in, hold for a moment, then a 6 or 7-count out. Sometimes splashing cold water on your face can help snap you out of the intensity a bit. 

Grounding yourself by noticing 5 things you can see, 4 you can touch, 3 you can hear, 2 you can smell, and 1 you can taste can also help pull your mind away from the panic.

Honestly though, a panic attack lasting for hours like this, with those intense physical symptoms... that's something you need to get checked out by a doctor or even at an urgent care/ER right away, just to make sure everything is okay physically and to get some immediate help. They can make sure it's not something else and help you get relief. It's not typical for a single panic attack to last that long with such intensity.

They can help figure out if it's severe anxiety or panic disorder, or if something else is contributing, and get you on a path to managing these so they don't keep happening. 

Plz make sure you're safe... if things feel out of control or your symptoms get worse, get help from emergency services or a hotline immediately.

"Can someone please tell me what this is??? So, there is this thing where I need to constantly have a word or statement that represents something in my life or some word that looks cool or is connected to something that I like, in my head. In my head it's like written out on a dark screen in white. The thing is that the word kind of like affects my mood and attention. And this word or stamednt doesn't last long, I'll have it for like 39 minutes and when I'm tired of it, my head kind of gets overwhelmed, I become so tired and depressed. It's like I can't function without these words. It's like without them, I'm aimless, and have no personality. It's like I can't use my mind or do the things I like without them. It's like I don't exist, I don't know how to explain it. Over the years these words have changed but for like the last 2 years, I've been alternating between these 5 words one after the other and I am so sick of it. This is how I've lived every single day since Lockdown ended. I think it is the reason I'm even failing my classes. When none of these words hits the spot, I even lowkey lose control of myself. I end up binge eating or masturbating or so weak that I just roll around in bed and I get really sweaty. This is the best way I can explain this, I hope it makes sense.

"Delhi based psychiatrist here : 

first of all, this is not some random overthinking. What you‚Äôre describing is deep, and it makes total sense. I can feel the fatigue behind your words like your brain‚Äôs wired to latch onto a ‚Äúword‚Äù to just feel like you exist. That‚Äôs not drama. That‚Äôs survival.

See, what I‚Äôm hearing is that these words? They‚Äôre not just words. They‚Äôre like mental oxygen. Without them, everything gets fuzzy ‚Ä¶.like your self vanishes. And then boom, the spiral hits: exhaustion, low mood, bingeing, zoning out. It‚Äôs like your brain doesn‚Äôt know how to function unless it has that anchor.

That tells me a few things:

This feels like mental compulsions ‚Äî a sort of ‚ÄúOCD of the self.‚Äù Not the handwashing kind, but more like ‚Äúif I don‚Äôt have that word in my head, I don‚Äôt know who I am.‚Äù

It also sounds like your brain‚Äôs trying to force an identity through these words. That ‚Äúscreen in your head‚Äù? It‚Äôs like your mind built a dark room to project who you are. And when that projection fails, you go dark too. That‚Äôs deep, man.

Could also be your system‚Äôs way of regulating feelings ‚Ä¶like your mind is buffering reality using these mantras. When the buffer crashes? So do you.


But bro‚Ä¶ you‚Äôre not broken.

You‚Äôre adaptive. This might‚Äôve started in lockdown makes sense ‚Ä¶.when the outside world collapsed, the mind had to build some inside rules to survive‚Ä¶Only now those same rules are suffocating you.


What can you do without therapy, since I feel you on that one

Name the Loop
Start calling it something ‚Ä¶‚Äùthe Word Trap‚Äù or ‚Äúthe Loop Monster‚Äù or whatever. The moment you name it, it stops being you. It becomes something you deal with.


De-power the Word

Try this: take one of the words, say it out loud 40 times till it loses all meaning. Your brain will realize it‚Äôs just sound.
That‚Äôs how you defuse it. (It‚Äôs an ACT technique, legit stuff.)

Shift the Anchor

If words don‚Äôt work anymore, try other grounding things: a song on repeat, a smell (like your soap or coffee), a visual cue (photo, wallpaper, etc).
You‚Äôre just shifting the power from one loop to something else.

Catch the Crash

When that ‚Äúnothing hits‚Äù feeling comes ‚Ä¶.don‚Äôt aim to fix it. Just ride it out consciously. 5 minutes of doing one small act: brush teeth, stretch, wash face. No pressure to be productive. Just exist with intention.

Find Safe Corners Online

Since therapy‚Äôs tough, look at Reddit‚Äôs r/OCD, r/mentalhealth, r/ADHD ‚Ä¶.anywhere people talk about internal struggles. You‚Äôll realize you‚Äôre far from alone, bro.

Now the Real talk:

You built this system to survive. And you did. But now it‚Äôs okay to say ‚Ä¶‚Äùyo brain, thanks for helping me back then, but now let‚Äôs upgrade.‚Äù

You‚Äôre not weak. You‚Äôre tired.
You‚Äôre not crazy. You‚Äôre wired a little different.
You‚Äôre not alone. You just haven‚Äôt found your tribe yet.

"Help me identify my coworker's mental issue I don't post this to be mean. I'm genuinely curious. 

What sort of mental illness causes the other person to react to every single noise or move you make? I'm talking *everything* I do. 
I work in an office as the receptionist. This person is new to the office. It's driving me up the wall. 
Examples:

If I walk to the kitchen to fill my water, she stirs up a coughing fit (for attention).

If I print papers for a client, she stirs up the 'uncontrollable' coughs again (for attention). 

If I answer the phone and am talking to a client, she (I assume intentionally) finds *this* to be the perfect time to *VERY LOUDLY* interrupt my conversation - then she disingenuously apologizes for 'interrupting.'

If she walks out the front door, she passes my reception window. If I don't say bye, or acknowledge her leaving (or entering), she finds a way to either come back inside and claim she forgot something. 
 OR she will notice that I'm not feeding into her need for attention, and she will ask me loudly, ""ARE YOU OKAY???"" - It's the NEED for attention and acknowledgement that I am so flustered about. And loudly proclaiming to the entire office the ""are you okay""s are making me insane. We don't have to say hey or bye every time you want to leave or even arrive at the office. A simple 'hey' suffices for me, anyway. Move along and go about your day. Don't expect me to acknowledge you if you aren't a client. That is not my job. 

It's driving me nuts. 
One thing I've always despised, a personal pet pieve, is this behavior exactly: 
Doing things out of pocket to be acknowledged, and/or seeking attention where it isn't needed. 
My knee-jerk reaction is NOT to respond to any of these vies for attention. In fact, I intentionally ignore when people seek attention because it's not my job to acknowledge your insecurity. Grow up? Open to hearing your thoughts, everyone. 

P.S. - I'm very mentally strong. Don't think I'm crumbling. I'm just genuinely interested in researching what the heck is going on here. My intention is to be kind and show Christ to everyone who walks into the office.

"Constantly having negative instrusive thoughts Since 1 year I am having negative intrusive thoughts, first I thought I could be schizophrenic, went to a psychiatry, they said it's only intrusive thoughts, I was there for 2 months, it didn't work out well enough, my intrusive thoughts came back. In 2017 I had a depersonalization, because I discovered that I might be gay, at the time I was at a psychiatry for 1 week, I was afraid to tell them that I had dpdr because of my possible homosexuality and left with a bad feeling. 

My intrusive thoughts are currently telling me in the voice of people that I know, for example when I was in 2017 at the psychiatry, I had a very bad feeling about the psychiatrist, like I could sense her emotions, I'm hearing that I am ""destroyed"" and that's why I'm at the psychiatry. I'm also hearing that my parents gaslighted me all my life, and that messed up my brain and my view of the world. I hear that I'm below straight women in the social hierarchy, because I'm gay, I couldn't accept that the world is "" you f*ck or you are f*cked"" rule.

I went to multiple therapists in the last years, with my first therapist we did therapy for a year, after 1 year pause I went to an other one, and she said that my ex-therapist lied to me, that wasn't really therapy and that affected me badly. That statement really messed me up, I felt like I can't continue therapy. After couple months I started to hear intrusive thoughts, like my brain is trying to explain to me why am I feeling myself so bad, and it tells me that people lied to me, also my therapists. After that I went to the psychiatry and I felt like the therapist doesn't really help me. I explained that my father sexually abused me, and I also abused my sister which I felt really bad at the time, and I feel like the therapist thought I don't deserve to be treated correctly, so she gave me fake treatment to mess up my brain. 

I'm also hearing that I'm not a real person, I don't show my real self, or when people would indentify me, I turn them down. 

I really don't know for sure, but I feel like it's true that you ""shoot or you get shot"" and don't know how to go with that. Because in 2017 I wasn't entirely honest in the psychiatry, the psychiatrist showed her middle finger under the table, and I felt that on her face. Like if I don't f*ck, I get f*cked and she manipulated me into a wrong path, so I feel like I'm dumb, worthless, an omega male. And because she did that, I feel like my soul has been destroyed and I feel like I'm her. I also felt this feeling in school, where there was a classmate who seemed to not like me, and on purpose he wanted to be friends with me, so he could mess up my brain.

"How can I find suicide attempt survivors to interview for a book? (I myself have struggled with ideation) Hello, lovely people!

A few months ago, I began writing a blurb on my experience with chronic suicidal ideation. Suddenly, it has turned into thirty pages, and I've decided that I'd like to make it into a short book (maybe 80-100 pages) for those struggling with the same thing. Now, I can't help but feel I need to do more personal research before continuing, as I have never attempted suicide. Though I have come close many times, my lack of personal experience is something I intend to discuss in the book, and I want to hear directly from survivors so I can better understand and help others. The rules of this subreddit don't clearly say asking for interviewees is not allowed, but I thought I'd begin by asking anyone if they have ideas where else I may look to find potential interviewees.

"Flushing pills. My mom only gives me my medication one dose at a time because of dozens of ods, and so she knows if she's given me my medicine or not. However I don't want to be on medicine, I tried going cold turkey at the mental hospital, but they wouldn't let me leave until I took my meds. So I've been home for almost a month and I've been taking my meds waiting to talk to my outpatient psychiatrist, but the mood swings are soooo extreme and I think it's from my medication, all my issues are from my meds and so I've been wanting to get off them for a while now, but I just can't wait to talk to my psychiatrist so I tried telling my mom I wasn't going to take them but she got upset and said I don't have a choice so I just flushed them. I've been on medication for 5 years so many different kinds and for the 5 years I've struggled had and it's all because of my medications. So I just can't wait any longer.

"Pit in my stomach seeing how doctors reacted to a pain patient suicide Post was a link to an article posted in a medicine subreddit, about a well known case of a chronic pain patient killing himself after his dose was abruptly cut in half and he couldn‚Äôt get ahold of his doctor, or anyone for that matter, to help him. Family sued the doctor and won. 

Many things to learn from this case, right? Patients being abandoned by their doctors and sent into dangerous life threatening withdrawals? The stigmatization of opioids leading to death? the abrupt cutting of doses causing irreparable damage? The broken American healthcare system making refills much harder than they should be? ‚ÄúOverdose prevention measures‚Äù like dose cuts actually causing much more damage than the damage they supposedly want to prevent? The tragedy of someone offing themselves because their skin is unbearable to live in? What horrible physical sensation someone must feel to decide that it‚Äôs better to die? That he would still be alive if it wasn‚Äôt for the rhetoric concerning narcotics today? 

Nah. That‚Äôs what losers like you and me get from it. What did people with medical degrees in a medicine sub take from this one article? That it‚Äôs better to not prescribe narcotics at all and not take any patients with chronic pain to avoid this legal trouble. Many of them calling the patient who killed himself an addict who shouldn‚Äôt have taken more meds than prescribed. Calling the jury idiots and calling this a terrible legal precedent. 

A man killed himself because he was in unspeakable agony and it could‚Äôve all been prevented. Will somebody please think of the poor doctor who could get into legal trouble for neglecting his patient!

"It's always a pendulum swing. Before it was ""got a hangnail, here some opioids"" now it's ""9/10 pain? Better not give opioids in case you get addicted"".

The problem never were chronic pain patients, they show a lower addiction potential than you would think (there is a difference between dependance and addiction, you can get dependant on many things without being addicted, heart medication, antidepressiva, antiepilleptoica all produce a physical dependance and withdrawal symptoms), it was giving opioids when an ibuprofen would have been enough. Now they try going the other extreme, not giving strong pain killers any reason they can think of.

I get it, they are afraid of getting sued and stuff, but did you go into medicine to be safe and make money or help people? If the first you should change your profession.

And empathy is sorely lacking these days, with Doctors on average having like 5-10minutes per patient I am not surprised they think of patients as numbers and not people",comment_5,r/ChronicPain,Health,,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChronicPain/comments/1kzwi35/pit_in_my_stomach_seeing_how_doctors_reacted_to_a/

"Somebody did something really kind for me today, and it was absolutely devastating. I had a busy day of running errands today. A bunch of stops at banks and and run to Costco. I was out for close to four hours. Towards the end, after some grocery shopping I was returning the cart to the corral or whatever and I passed a guy sitting in his car. We briefly made eye contact in the way that you do normally with strangers. I didn't think much of it. I returned the cart, started walking back to my car and he rolled down his window. 

""How bro! You okay"" he asked.

I stopped for a second, not really understanding what was happening. 

""I'm good"" I said. ""Why do you ask?""

""You just look kind of sad.""

I didn't know what to say to this. For half a second I considered explaining that I've been depressed and in pain for almost twenty years, but that seemed like a massive overshare so I just kind of laughed, assured him I was fine and thanked him for asking. 

It was really cool for him to ask. A guy reaching out to another guy, offering support and whatnot. We could use more stuff like that in our world...but it kind of broke me. I don't have the energy to regulate my face like that, especially when I'm out doing stuff. It kills me that I'm giving off the type of vibe that strangers feel the need to check up on me. This isn't the person I wanted to be as a kid, you know?

I've had this happen before as well. I too was running errands and had just made it back to my car and a lady came up to my car and asked if I was ok or needed anything. I was crying which is likely why she approached me. I briefly explained I was in pain and that is why I was upset. I thanked her for checking and assured her I was okay.

I told her yes, and she gestured for me to come over to her, and I did. 
Then she told me to come really close, and turn around so that my back was facing her. I was confused, but did what she asked. 

This little twig of a woman reached out and started weakly rubbing my back.

Is it awful? Of course. It sucks. But you're just sick. Like any other sickness, it'll be miserable for a while, and then you'll get better.

"Guilt Hello, this is to anyone that has or is suffering from chronic pain, autoimmune disease, or any of many debilitating diseases and injuries. Especially the ones that have been passed over, or not taken seriously by the medical system. The people that have not been properly diagnosed, or even given the chance to have the proper testing done. The ones that have proven chronic pain, injuries, and or diseases that affect daily living and are not getting the proper medication or proper pain relief, because of the way the medical system is today. I read about what some of you have to go through, trying desperately to get someone to listen, and understand what you go through on any given day. Desperately trying to get someone to perform the necessary testing to get a diagnosis. Desperately trying to get relief from the pain so you can at least sit outside and watch your kids play. Desperately trying to get others understand how much you hurt and truly understand how much you are affected by it. To all these wonderful people I AM SO SORRY!!!!!!  I personally have seropositive RA, several fractured vertebrae, rotator issues both shoulders, could go on. Every month when I pick my meds up I feel so damn guilty,  Every time I go to one of several of my Drs I feel so guilty. Every imaging, lab draw, ct scan, x ray, MRI I feel guilty. I feel the way I do because I have had it so easy, and most everyone else has had so many negative issues with the system. I have good relationships with all my Drs, they go out of their way often to make sure I get everything I need through testing, referrals, meds. I have a good relationship with my pharmacy and the pharmacists themselves. They make sure my meds are in stock and ready, most times a couple days earlier than I need them. Even my insurance company has done everything possible to ensure I have all medication, tests, specialist visits for Hardly any out of pocket money.  I feel so bad that I have had it so easy and so many wonderful people have had true horror stories with the medical system. I thank God I am so fortunate and I ask him to please help the ones that need to be heard.  I hope and pray things change, so people can get the medical attention they need, and again I am so sorry for what you have to go through. I hope everyone has a wonderful day, and I am praying for you.",post,r/ChronicPain,Health,20.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChronicPain/comments/1kzzr10/guilt/

"SSRI use A bit of a head scratcher, I have always been skeptical of SSRIs and had some bad experiences. Even when I can tolerate them, I end up making mistakes and not thinking clearly.


I have a very serious issue with my ears which was many years coming but lately it suddenly got worse. I have all the classic signs of M√©ni√®re‚Äôs including the most severe vertigo attacks and unilateral hearing loss, months of tinnitus that switches ears, but my doctor insists they‚Äôre vestibular migraines because I didn‚Äôt get dizzy when she tried to tilt my head. To clarify, Meniere‚Äôs comes from fluid in the ears, and if you‚Äôre not in the middle of an attack you can‚Äôt just get dizzy on command. 

I also have jaw issues ( tight jaw muscles) 

So I saw ENT with specialty in vertigo and a very renowned jaw specialist. 

They both put me on Amytriptiline. The jaw specialist says it relaxes muscles and is used off label. In the past Baclofen has helped. 

The ENT says it‚Äôs good for calming tinnitus and sensitivity, yet it‚Äôs ototoxic. 

I can‚Äôt shake the feeling I‚Äôm being dismissed again as someone whose issues may be somatoform or in their head. Is there any chance that‚Äôs not the case? 

I‚Äôm asking because I was put on Cymbalta and sent to a psychiatrist ( who put me on Cymbalta) for an unstable SI joint. More recently I was diagnosed with ‚ÄúFibromyalgia‚Äù for what is plantar fasciitis ( with a telling bone spur).

"I feel really ill but I don't wanna seek help anymore due to medical trauma I've been having chronic pain for 5 years. It's constant. But somehow what ends up affecting me the most is not the pain sensation itself but the constant full body discomfort that comes with it. My issue is in my neck so it just affects everything below it. I have palpitations, nausea, I feel dizzy and lightheaded during certain hours of the day. There might be another underlying condition there but it all came with the pain. I chalk it up to just the exhaustion of the pain. But there‚Äôs something seriously, seriously wrong. I feel it. 

It just frustrated me today how I'm expected to operate under these conditions. My pain is certainly much more managed than when I was untreated (I go for medication refills every 6 or 3 months with my chronic pain doctor), but I still feel like shit sometimes and I still think I could be maybe doing better with more help and a better understanding of my condition. AKA, more imaging, more studies, more... y'know, doctors doing the description of their job for once.

But I don't wanna start the whole healthcare journey over. I refuse to go back to seeking answers bc it was a deeply traumatizing experience. I was dismissed, insulted, made fun of, told shit so cruel I still think about it at night. I posted about it once, how a doctor told me I'd never be happy again bc I had chronic pain. It literally still keeps me up at night. I'm over it, I don't really believe it, but it's genuinely something you can never shake off. I'm not giving doctors an opportunity to say some shit like that to my face again. I choose the pain and discomfort over having to deal with them again for a chance of maybe a little less pain and discomfort. That's just how bad it was.

I'm not suicidal anymore, but god, sometimes I truly do wonder how I keep going. In this world that doesn't care and with doctors that couldn't give less of a shit. In a world where I'm branded as the one with chronic pain so for any other sort of completely unrelated medical issue you have, it'll be a stain on your medical history and doctors will continually question you about it. I went for a fucking earwax blockage removal once and the nurse started questioning me why I took tramadol. That's why I don't wanna see their fucking faces ever again. If I ever break a bone or something I'm fixing it up myself with tape and gorilla glue. The thought of having to face them again terrifies me.

And yet I still prefer it this way. The damage they do is so big and the chance of them genuinely helping me is so little, it's just not worth it for me.",post,r/ChronicPain,Health,26.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChronicPain/comments/1kzukfo/i_feel_really_ill_but_i_dont_wanna_seek_help/

"Tramadol is tricky (and a strange drug)  when and if you decide to come off it, You still will have some sort of we symptoms depending on how long you are on it. It‚Äôs tricky in the sense that in the body it does metabolize into something similar to an opiate (even though it‚Äôs not a true opiate like morphine) so it works on those receptors in the brain, hence why you feel okay and don‚Äôt really have any negative effects from stopping the oxy. Those receptors are still being filled by the tramadol. Not only that, tramadol works on serotonin receptors and reuptake like an antidepressant would it blocks your brain from reabsorbing serotonin, leading to increased levels of serotonin in the brain (like an antidepressant) So you‚Äôve kind of got a double whammy when it comes to dependence and possible withdrawal depending on amounts and duration of treatment.",comment_3,r/ChronicPain,Health,,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChronicPain/comments/1l0cl58/switching_pain_meds/

"What‚Äôs next? Hi guys hope you are well!

Had my recent MRI scan after an injury I had last year. Pulled my back and turns out I have 2 mild discs that are not yet effecting any nerves and one below that is moderately bulging and pressing against two nerves. I can put the specifics up if anyone requires
It‚Äôs in my lower back btw.

Anyhow, since then I‚Äôve been in a lot of pain! Doctor originally started me off on an anti inflammatory and amitriptyline. He thought I had sciatica and was wondering what the damage is.
Anyway the amitriptyline didn‚Äôt work nor the anti inflammatory and they put me on Pregabalin and tramadol for the pain. I‚Äôm on 150mg of tramadol a day and Pregabalin I‚Äôm on 400mg a day. The issue is the tramadol really from the start hasn‚Äôt done much however the doctor was hesitant to give anything else. He said I should just be taking paracetamol which I do anyway and I haven explained that it‚Äôs not sufficient unless you want me to take packets a day.

Got my MSK appointment on Monday and they are going over the situation and the next steps. Just wondering what you guys think will be next. 
I‚Äôm doing physio and all the exercises that they gave. 
Originally they thought I had pulled a muscle. Just shows doesn‚Äôt it!

Any other good pain killers you would recommend? I mean I‚Äôve tried co-codamol and all that did was give me the ‚Äúblocks‚Äù haha. On a bit of a limp as to what else to do. Tried lidocaine on the back the lot.

I do feel though that my condition has been getting worse. Originally it was just down one side was the pain now it effects both my legs. My hands have started weirdly to lose sensation like when I‚Äôm trying to cut up food or driving. I have to keep moving them about for the feelings to come back. If I‚Äôm on my feet a lot I‚Äôm in agony all day. If I sit down too long I‚Äôm in agony all day. Really no winning.

"Unless discs are fully herniated due to fear mongering, doctors are under a lot of pressure from the DEA. It's a weird life being in chronic pain. We almost hope scans show something bad enough that we ""know what's wrong.""

You don't even need to say. Your L4-L5 are affected but not fully herniated nor definitively pushing or pinching nerves. Pregabalin works well for nerve pain. You may need to be taking it 3x daily. 

Your doctor is much more likely to change the dosage of that to the maximum since you're 2/3 the way there. He will give you 200mg 3x a day, which may help a lot. 600mg of Pregabalin is a lot and should help you out once you get timing down. 

Tramadol is an odd drug. 150mg is equivalent to 15mg of Morphine or 10mg Oxycodone. This is why it's not effective for you. But to ask for more this early on is a mistake. 

I suggest getting the rest of your scans, figuring out if the discectomy is worth it. Also, smoke or eat MMJ. It potentiate the pain killing effects of both medications you're on. Take either acetaminophen or ibuprofen alongside your meds. Whichever works better - though I do recommend ibuprofen at least 3x weekly for the anti-inflammatory effects.

"Seeing if anyone knows 
Tl;dr: always had really tense muscles. Cold water helps. Had a week where I could barely walk triggered by soaking in a hottub and exessive calf massaging. Bending over left me out of breath. *But* my pain levels were at an all time low! 


Hi. I have chronic pain. Big shocker - I know. Like many of you, neither I nor my doctors know wtf is wrong with me. Allegedly, I have fibromyalgia, but I'm still wondering if any of you have insight into my muscle issues. Blood test shows no signs of inflammation. 

I've always been extremely tense. I'd get a massages maybe once or twice a year growing up, and almost every single time the massage therapist would ask if I'm okay. Not an, ""Are you uncomfortable right now?"" but rather, ""What the fuck does this child do to be so tense? Should I call someone?"" 

I've only recently experienced having my muscles relax. After a 90 minute massage. But my muscles began going back to normal when I stood up. 

The biggest help aside from weed is cold water. My parents have a hottub and sometimes I'll go sit in it when the water is cold. In the past year or so, my body has began reacting negatively to going in the hottub (when it's hot). It started fairly mild. The next day, my body would get some inflammation. Then, one day, when my calves had been perpetually cramping for a week, I went into the hottub after using an air compression calf massager for a few hours. I know this was probably a bad idea, but I was desperate. The next day, I couldn't walk more than a few feet. It took around two weeks until I was back to normal. 

My knees felt like there was zero structural integrity to them. Like my knee cap was wobbling around. And my calves wouldn't support me. I can't really recall how my calves felt. They stopped cramping on the second day, and, infact, my pain levels were the lowest they'd ever been! I couldn't remember being in such little pain! It took around two months for the pain to fully return. 

I believe I have ME/CFS (Chronic Fatigue Syndrome). I say this, because during my time of leg weakness, my body couldn't handle doing anything. I could only lay in bed. Bending down had be gasping for air and about to collapse from exhaustion. 

Two weeks ago, I did a little test. I did one round of the leg massager on my calves, then had only my calves in the hottub for around 15 minutes. Next day, my calves were noticeably weak, but it went away by the end of the day. 

My mom thinks its something released from my muscles relaxing, since she's experienced side effects from massages doing just that. I think maybe my body doesn't know how to work without being super tense.",post,r/ChronicPain,Health,2.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChronicPain/comments/1l062y6/seeing_if_anyone_knows/

"Doctor said they don't prescribe muscle relaxants for TMJ. Been crying all day. I deal with TMJ and it has been debilitating for 12 years, the pain has been relentless. I spoke to my dentist recently, and they referred me to an oral surgeon who said the jaw was okay it was muscle tension that needed a muscle relaxant as I'd already tried the other suggested paths so I'd have to speak to my dentist about getting the prescription. They also wrote a letter to them just so I had 'proof' in writing. Well my dentist said they can't give me a muscle relaxant because of my gastritis since they can't monitor how it'll react to it. My dentist also seems very keen on making me continue jaw exercises which have helped slightly but I've been doing them with their assistance for years and it's like if there's not much improvement the next logical step is medicaiton.  But they said speak to your primary doctor about getting a muscle relaxant. 

So I spoke to my doctor and he said that doctors don't prescribe muscle relaxants for TMJ. He said to maybe get off my antidepressant as that could be causing the muscle tension, and I said I'd speak to my dentist again about trying the jaw exercises again but he said they've hit a brick wall with me. It's just so disheartening because I've spoken to other people who've been prescribed muscle relaxants for a short period and it really helped them get a step ahead of the issue or at least experience relief for a fucking week. 

I'm also not buying that claim that doctors don't prescribe muscle relaxants? It's pretty common place as a way to at least test if it's a neuromuscular issue and if so then it becomes clearer on how to manage it. I'm also so envious of people who've managed to get a doctor that'll try a few muscle relaxants with them to help ease the muscle tension because I just feel like I'm being sent from one place to the next and I don't know what to do anymore.",post,r/ChronicPain,Health,119.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChronicPain/comments/1kzfxqv/doctor_said_they_dont_prescribe_muscle_relaxants/

"Potential chronic adductor pain (pain on thigh around the groin area) I (20M) don't exactly remember how I got the injury, but since the injury, the inside muscle of my left leg just hurt when I engage them (the adductor). My right leg is fine.

It's been like this for almost a year now. They don't hurt when I don't engage the muscle. The pain feels sharp, gradual and awkward. It doesn't make me squirm from the pain, but just enough to make it feel uncomfortable. 

Movements like moving the leg outside in, or twisting the leg inward will cause the pain to happen.

I don't feel the pain when running, walking or cycling, but feel it when I am lying down and moving the my leg in the air (mostly when doing core exercises)

Since the injury I try to avoid using the muscle as much as possible. Before this I tried to practice calisthenic, but all the core workouts that involves legs moving in the air will cause me pain, so I just avoid doing bodyweight workout all together and move to endurance sports (running and cycling).

Even though I said that my adductor hurt, maybe it can be the other muscles near my groin.

"Chronic intestinal pain since colonoscopy ten weeks ago Hi I (40M) am posting here wondering if someone has the same issue as me or can give me some ideas. I had a colonoscopy ten weeks ago and since then I have had pain on my intestines every single day. My stool is fine but I feel tired most of the time - which can be because of the pain. It gets worse when I move, so it usually subsides a lot at night (thank god). The pain ‚Äúmoves around‚Äù but it‚Äôs always on my large intestine area - basically the area which got scoped. 
Since my stool is fine and the usual exams don‚Äôt detect anything, doctors are not interested in helping me anymore. I tried going the antidepressant route (recommended by my therapist) but I had all kinds of bad side effects.
For a long time I hoped the pain would eventually subside but after ten weeks I am losing hope and wondering if this pain will accompany me forever. I already tried antibiotics, probiotics, changing food habits (I see no connection between what I eat and the pain)‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt think I have any allergies or anything because prior to my colonoscopy I had no pain in my intestines regardless of what I ate.

"For people struggling with depression and isolation simultaneously, please help, I'm stuck in a circle I understand most folks here are grown adults and have managed to partake in some short of social circle, but I would really like to hear some people here who dont have that. Who either live totally alone, no social life, or people with no friends (at all) who live with their parents who are not fulfilling the emotional need enough, or, well, people who feel very lonely and have noone to reach out to I guess would be a better way to say it, cause of course you could live with a 1000 people and still feel alone.

I am really struggling. I have chronic spinal issues for two years now which slowly lead to major depression. I was always mentally unwell, I never had friends, I was the weird kid, and my country is quite conservative, I never really fit in, I always felt lonely, so all that + the appearance of chronic pain and boom, you get a suicidal person. I have attempted. I have such thoughts almost daily, I have been visiting a psychiatrist for almost a year now, and no drug has sufficiently helped, my organism completely rejects them. No side effects, or effects, its like ive said in a lot of posts here on reddit, its like these drugs are coming out whole out my ass, absolutely nothing. The only drug I can really say is working is seroquel, its been an absolute life saver, i know its slowly atrophying/messing up my brain in its own unique ways but sorry yall i cant live without it at this point.

I could go on listing the meds ive tried but I dont want to make such a long post, I can tell you guys in the comments if you want,

But to make things short,

I am 19, I have no higher education, I have no friends, no support group, I cant walk or participate in many activities so that doesnt help with socializing either, I am not religious, never have been, lately ive been having a lot of inner battles regarding philosophical issues which has both helped me and made things worse, I am overweight, I dont try to improve on my own in any ways, I cant work a job, I cant get any doctor to take me seriously.

Basically sums it up. The spinal issues occurred after working in construction for nearly 2 years, while at the same time being on an overly strict diet that tortured my body in ways i was too dumb to notice, so, I lost a ton of muscle, and combined with such a hard job my spine just gave up. I was dumb, foolish and blinded by the money (which I became addicted to since it helped me ignore my mental issues).

So where do we go now? A lot of people tell me I need a kick in the ass to get to moving, which I dont disagree with, a lot of times I have these terrible thoughts like my dad getting cancer or something like that, so im forced to work a job and make money, thus slowly improving me in some way. So basically I wonder sometimes if I really do need a kick in the ass, something or someone forcefully get me moving. Cause right now its either that or I kill myself, I dont see another way out. The only other thing I think could help was being in some kind of group, have some legit friends, or a partner or whatever, be a part of something, zizek (a philosopher) calls this ""a big other"",  which is something zizek says pretty much everyone needs. Either a religion, a group, a band, love, anything. But I cant do that, ive tried so much ive given up. I know this subreddit isnt r/depression but I really dont think it matters, I do have pain, I could go in detail if you all want in the comments I just think if this essay gets any longer people will ignore it immediately.

P.S: OR, I really just havent found my drug yet and this is all depression talking, maybe I can be a loner and beat depression with the right drug, but from what im seeing in general that doesnt really happen.

"Hi friend,

I just posted today on this Reddit about my own experience with SS. I‚Äôm so sorry you‚Äôve gone through this.

First, your emotions are valid. But they are also extremely heightened right now as you recover from this imbalance, and you could experience these high emotions for awhile. So do some self talk: ‚Äúyes this med helped you and now you cannot take it, but it‚Äôs not the only medication. This is not the end of the world or the end of my story. I can and will find something else.‚Äù

Be very gentle with yourself right now, please.


Duloxetine and pregablin do a lot of the same thing and neither are indicated for chronic pain beyond very specific conditions. Doctors are putting us on them to avoid actual pain meds. If pregablin isn‚Äôt helping you, get off it (titrate down). 

Now that you‚Äôve have serotonin syndrome, your doctor cannot play fast and loose with these non approved drugs for pain. Gently push for an actual pain med, like hydrocodone, morphine, Torodal, etc - something out there will work for your specific needs. You‚Äôve tried and failed the alternatives, it‚Äôs time for your doctor to give you a pain contract and actual help.

Best of luck. Be kind to you, you‚Äôre your best shot at getting to the next best step.",comment_2,r/ChronicPain,Health,,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChronicPain/comments/1kzhalv/im_so_so_sad/

I'm currently at college and internship, and I really enjoy what I do, but pain is always there. You see my baseline pain is 8/10 everyday non stop, even during sleep. For this it was not uncommon for me to work at severe pain of 9/10, completely pain fogged. 

But at this point what bothers me  most than pain, is medical neglect. The amounts  I've gotten of negligent doctors saying things like: you just need to exercise the joints (even though I had already engaged in pt a lot of times, and I can't even open a door), or like, but there will always be pain, just toughen up (which was exactly that kind of mindset that made me delay appointment until I was completely disabled), or even orthos asking until when I'm going to stay at my workplace. Or the worst of all: it's mild. HELL IF IT WAS MILD AS YOU SAY I WOULDN'T BE HERE, EXPOSING MYSELF TO YOUR FUCKED TREATMENT THAT DON'T EVEN EXAMINS THE PATIENTS.

Instead I was just given the most basic pathetic pain killers that do nothing or said to strengthen then


Really you go to the er bc you were unable to work due to pain and another patient with some acute injury that is completely functional being better treated than you is just devastating.

"Any recommendations for GOOD pain control docs in NC? I have never in my life witnessed the neglect my mom has been getting for chronic pain. She has seen 3 pain control doctors now who tell her to take gabapentin (that stuff does not work for anyone I know who has to take it, including my mom). It is always: gabapentin and some sort of NSAID. She has scans to show and prove her knees are on the side of her legs and she has spondyolothesis, bulging disk, collapsed, etc. Operation is not an option, also according to doctors. She has AVN in her hip so steroids have to be limited (including injections.) 

Today was my final straw when she told me the nurse of the pain control Dr (who sent his resident in but never came in himself during her visit) asked how my mom is getting celebrex (insinuating she‚Äôs getting it from the streets or something‚Ä¶like yes ofc let‚Äôs go get this non-controlled substance from the streets üôÑüôÑüôÑ.

I have several chronic conditions that cause immens pain. Some of the most painful conditions in the world. Which I am on disability for. Which was hard to get, but worth it and I am so grateful. 

My mother said, that I don‚Äôt actually have chronic pain, but I am inventing it for attention. Or that I am just lazy and want to avoid moving. Or that I am making up the pain cause I wanna punish my parents. She thinks I use a cane, cause I wanna spite her - not because I need it, duh.

And the thing is - I have looked at this from every angle and the most mind boggling part to me is her insistence on me making up reasons to use a cane, but secretly not actually needing one. So my question is: let‚Äôs say I am actually making this up. Let‚Äôs say I am using a cane for the hell of it (no matter how frigging impractical.) would that be so bad? Would that be the end of the world?

Intense pack pain while sleeping Hello everyone f 18 here. I've had back problems all my life from what my mom told me I have osteochondrosis. I'm saying from what my mom told me is because I don't remember that much I used to take pills for depression so my memory got bad. Anyways I've always had back pain every single day usually between my shoulder blades left side. I'm concerned because I've started doing exirsises for my back (about  5 months ago) nothing intense just regular exirsises like wall angels chest stretching and ect. About few months ago I've started experiencing lower back pain upper back pain and everywhere around my back while sleeping. I wake up multiple times during the night from the pain. I'm not sure if this is because started working out. The pain comes and goes sometimes it doesn't hurt while I sleep sometimes it's really bad. I've tried few methods like putting a pillow between my knees sleeping on my back but nothing seems to be working. Just few days ago I've got a compressed nerve ( I think that's what it's called?) Between my shoulder blades on the left side. It was intense pain and the skin are got numb. I'm seeing the doctor after about a month but just wondering is there any people here that experienced the same thing and what helped .,post,r/ChronicPain,Health,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChronicPain/comments/1l03ibh/intense_pack_pain_while_sleeping/

"Constant one-sided headache for 4‚Äì5 years. MRI clear. Not migraine (according to doctor). Doctor (specialist in headaches in a private hospital) is unsure. I‚Äôm here because I‚Äôve been dealing with a chronic one-sided headache for the past 4‚Äì5 years, and no one ‚Äî not doctors, not physios ‚Äî has been able to figure out exactly what it is.

The pain is always on the left side: left temple, side of the head, back of the head, even behind the eye and around the skull. It‚Äôs a dull, pressing, constant pain, not sharp or pulsing. It comes and goes randomly throughout the day, but it‚Äôs there for hours every single day. There‚Äôs no clear trigger ‚Äî it can happen when I‚Äôm sitting, lying down, walking, etc.

I‚Äôve had:
	
‚Ä¢	An MRI of my brain and neck ‚Äì completely normal.

	‚Ä¢	Over 6 months of physiotherapy, working on neck, shoulder blades, posture ‚Äì no improvement.

	‚Ä¢	Recently we focused on the SCM muscle (sternocleidomastoid) with massage/stretching for 2 months ‚Äì still no change.

I have no nausea, no light or sound sensitivity, no visual disturbances, no vomiting ‚Äî none of the typical migraine symptoms. My doctor doesn‚Äôt think it‚Äôs migraine either, and has mentioned that it might be a tension-type headache, but we still don‚Äôt know for sure.

Now my doctor is suggesting a GON block (Greater Occipital Nerve block) as the next step ‚Äî has anyone had experience with this? Did it help?

At this point, I‚Äôm completely lost. It‚Äôs been years of daily pain and no real answers.
I don‚Äôt want to rely on medication long-term ‚Äî I just want to understand what this is and how to manage it.

If anyone has experienced something similar, or has any thoughts on the GON block or what this might be, I‚Äôd be really grateful to hear from you.

"How did you finally get diagnosed with your Chronic illness? For me I spent most of my life being told I was a hypochondriac. I remember it hurt my back wearing a jacket in my teen years, and just always being in pain with something wrong. I had a very traumatic childhood so my psychologist mom always blamed it on that. No-one, including all the doctors would listen.

It wasn't until I was in my early 30's, where I had just given up, that I got hope after diagnosing myself first.

My husband and I went to the Sydney Opera House to see The King and I performed. During the interval there were many actors who played monks, they just sat there for 30 minutes with their legs crossed on the floor. I kept on thinking how? That has got to be so incredibly painful. What drugs are they on? Like WTF? It was then I realised that was normal. Normal people could do that. Abd that was the beginning. 

I started researching and low and behold I learned about Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome on the internet, it fit me to a T.

With that I went to a geneticist and was diagnosed! Finally, I'm not crazy!

Since then I've found out I have an extremely rare genetic deletion, my kids and I are the only ones in the world recorded with it so far. I didn't know until I was pregnant with my last.

I've since been diagnosed with not only Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome but also Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome, Mast Cell Activation Syndrome, Chronic EBV,  Autistic Level 2 and Graves Disease (in remission).

My spine and joints are very damaged with moderate to severe stenosis causing my left arm going paralysed, multiple herniated and bulging discs, degenerative disc disease, osteoarthritis throughout the spine and many joints, heaps of scarring everywhere, 1 deformed ankle and more.

But I will keep going for my kids.",post,r/ChronicPain,Health,4.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChronicPain/comments/1kzsrg7/how_did_you_finally_get_diagnosed_with_your/

"My current chronic pain is from a car accident so‚Ä¶.i got taken a bit more seriously because i had a traumatic event.

That being said, I‚Äôve had to push for diagnosis in a lot of areas.  For example, I herniated 11 discs in my back so a lot of things got blamed on that.  But one day I‚Äôm laying in bed at like 9 months post op and realize my hip joints click a lot.  So I went to an ortho, I had already looked up symptoms and said ‚ÄúI think I have a labral tear‚Äù.  I got a very ‚Äúwell that‚Äôs not common but we will do an MRI anyway if it will make you happy‚Äù and whatya know, labral tear on both hips.  I had the more painful of the two sides fixed and it helped me walk so much.

So yes drs listen but I‚Äôve often had to drive the conversation.  I also have endometriosis and we know how well getting that diagnosed goes.  It took me about 4 years and what pisses me off is I was really anemic and the drs looked everywhere for a bleed except just considering I may have a heavy period.

I have nerve pain in my right foot due to a crushed L5 nerve root so I empathize. I *hate* it when my foot feels like it's frozen and then the next minute it's like it's on fire. Have you had your blood sugar checked to make sure this isn't diabetic neuropathy? Otherwise I'd suggest getting an MRI of your spine to make sure you don't have a compressed nerve somewhere. It most likely is related to benzo withdrawal but better to be safe than sorry. I take 300mg of Lyrica 2x a day and it definitely helps but doesn't totally rid myself of the nerve pain.

"Can being prescribed medical MJ or taking kratom make docs hesitant to prescribe pain meds? Hello all. I am a regular kratom user which I don‚Äôt disclose to my doctors as it has never affected my health or my labs. I take it daily for pain. I also occasionally use MJ and live in a state where you can get it recreationally over 21. I am still under 21 (Can get kratom in NJ over 18 so i‚Äôm good there) but have been wondering about getting a medical card for MJ so I can get it from a proper dispensary. The thing is, kratom is good for pain but it‚Äôs nothing like taking a full opioid agonist. I‚Äôve taken opioids before (was prescribed morphine for a month, had a couple week long scripts after the ER, and after surgery) and those did wonders for my chronic pain. Would having that in my chart make them less likely to prescribe pain meds? I‚Äôm also young so I have that also working against me but I‚Äôm hopeful I can find a pain doc that can get me on a regimen. (Currently seeking out pain specialists. I‚Äôve seen one before at a children‚Äôs hospital and they tried gabapentin and amitriptyline which did absolutely nothing for me) and told me I needed to drink more water and just be more active. Id be more active if I wasn‚Äôt in crippling pain all the time. Also does anyone have tips for finding a pain doc who doesn‚Äôt see opioids as the absolute devil? I would be okay with maybe 10 pills a month to get me through my flares and bad pain days but ideally I‚Äôd like to be on a daily regimen with an extra script for breakthrough pain like I see many people have on this sub.

"Yes, having either in your file can really affect your pain medicine chances.

"Every medication has known interactions and potential interactions. It depends on how well studied are both of the substances, the ways they work in the body, and how they‚Äôre metabolized. 

There is some understanding of the interactions of marijuana and opioids, but (as far as I‚Äôm aware and please correct me if I‚Äôm wrong) very little understanding about Kratom. And there‚Äôs very little to no regulation on these drugs - MJ and Kratom being plants, each batch has a different composition, different contaminants, etc etc etc. 

I assume that medical marijuana should be more regulated, but again I don‚Äôt have enough information about it. I‚Äôd encourage you to do research on that.

I believe that the consumption of either can make a doctor more reluctant to prescribe opioids. Because of the known interactions - as in they have to be extra careful to balance things (substance and dosage) to minimize the potential of undesirable effects based on available information. Because of the potential unknown interactions - as in there is not enough information about what could happen and therefore no way of assessing the risks. And because of the usage of substances which are associated with careless drug use/drug abuse. 

I can‚Äôt say I entirely agree with the last one because what you do before entering a pain contract doesn‚Äôt necessarily correlate with how you will behave afterwards, but when prescribing substances that can be abused it is standard to evaluate the risk of abuse in that particular case.

So TL;DR: it may be hard for a doctor to know if it would be safe for you to take pain meds along with the other substances.",comment_2,r/ChronicPain,Health,,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChronicPain/comments/1kzw2db/can_being_prescribed_medical_mj_or_taking_kratom/

I was a nervous driver from day 1. One problem I have is that I have zero sense of direction. I even get moments when I am somewhere I have been a million times and it seems totally unfamiliar to me. I live in the US. My mom used to tell me whatever direction you think you should go, go the other way. I live near Philadelphia. My dad said, if you go too far East you will hit the ocean, if you go too far west you will hit the Rockies, if you go too far South everyone will be speaking Spanish (this was a hundred years ago, everybody speaks Spanish everywhere now), and if you go too far north you will be in Canada.

"I don‚Äôt know for sure but I wonder if you can ask them for a hair follicle or nailbed test.  The hair follicle will go back about 6 months and the nail bed I believe is 6-8 weeks.  If you believe urine test is inaccurate you might be able to do one of these to prove it.  Unfortunately with some insurances you will have to pay out of pocket these tests.

I would also make sure that they are aware of his medications.  I have a pain contract with my neurologist that includes yearly drug test and can be asked for a test at random.  A couple years ago my urine was showing positive for multiple ‚Äúsubstances‚Äù but there was a second step of the analysis that tested for the metabolites of the substances and it was all negative.  The doctor told me that some of my psych medications would cause false positives on the urine testing.  Took a test a few weeks ago and it was negative for everything except what should be present and my meds haven‚Äôt changed since last year.  So idk sometimes I question the tests with urine testing, I wish they would switch to blood testing.

Also if you contact the Dr or ARNP no matter how pissed off you may be remain calm, no cussing, no screaming.  Because if you do those the Dr is going to automatically shut down any conversations.  Can you talk with his primary doctor or renal doctor to see if they may be able to help or refer to a different pain management office?

Once the doctor has made up their mind that you're possibly an addict(according to the urine tests), they won't be changing their opinion. Too scared of the DEA.

"Serotonin Syndrome TLDR: As CPP, we are often made to take many classes of drugs that are not proven to help pain due to the opiate drug war/‚Äúcrisis‚Äù. Most of these drugs are serotonin agonists and can cause a deadly overdose of serotonin called Serotonin Syndrome. Most people have never heard of this, so I am sharing my terrible experience to spread awareness in our community. This happened to me in 2023.



As background, I am a long term chronic pain patient with well established diagnoses and reasons for medication. After suffering a blood clot to my liver I was put through 10 open, exploratory abdominal surgeries that included a coma where my abdomen was left exposed and open for 10 days. The result of so much surgery is abdominal adhesions that have my organs stuck together, constantly pulling on each other and creating nerve and organ torsion. I have an ostomy and pain resulting from remaining unused colon. This is my primary pain source. I also have a spinal cord injury at my L5/S1 that I‚Äôve have several surgeries for and have multiple sclerosis, POTS, and suspected EDS. So I deal with extreme pain daily.

Despite so many indicators for pain management, my doctors had me on a handful of meds that were prescribed outside of their approved purposes that I was mandated to take before they would prescribe pain meds. These were:
- amitriptyline: 50 mg x 2 daily
- Prozac: 40 mg
- Trazadone: 150 mg
- Duloxetine 
- Gabapentin
- Baclofen
I did not know this at the time, and neither my doctors nor my pharmacist ever mentioned it to me, but each one of these drugs affects your serotonin. Being on these, I was at risk of serotonin syndrome before legit pain meds were ever introduced, and I now know pain meds also affect serotonin. I was just a ticking time bomb.

When it came time to add actual pain meds, my pain management doctor was against putting me on hydrocodone first, despite me knowing this med worked well for me. His aversion was because my mme would be too high for *his* comfort at 3 - 10 mg pills a day. He tried to prescribe three other pain meds but insurance would not cover them. I failed to receive adequate pain management from Belbuca sublingual and patches, so my doctor decided to prescribe Methadone. I was AGAINST this, but I was told it was my only option and I had to at least try it. I told my doctor I was worried about how I would be treated in medical facilities when doctors noticed I was on this med, but my doctor acted like my concerns were silly.

I started the med at 2.5 mg and it managed my pain extremely well. This was exciting because it was cheap and it was working. Unfortunately, my mental health took a sharp turn within about a week. At first, I just seemed a bit manic to my husband. My heart was racing and I couldn‚Äôt stop sweating. I called my doctor and my pharmacist but neither seemed concerned it was the medication. Before long, I was talking way, way too much and my stories weren‚Äôt making sense. My husband was listening and trying to track but becoming concerned. My talking turned into hallucinations and full suicidal ideations. My best friend and my husband both went through the wringer trying to keep up with my situation, which for me was turning to full panic. I KNEW something was very wrong but I couldn‚Äôt verbalize it and I couldn‚Äôt make my words make sense anymore. The more I babbled, the less I actually said that made sense, but the harder I tried. A week in, I was no longer sleeping and the mania was intense. I thought I was having a heart attack.

My husband wanted to take me to the er, but felt there was no way he could safely transport me in a car due to the mania and hallucinations. He called an ambulance. Unfortunately, police showed up first. He tried explaining the situation and told the police he thought I was having a reaction to my methadone and stated I was on it as a pain patient. The police called a 51/50 and seperated me from my husband and called in for back up. They stated I was having heroin detox mania. My husband tried to fight to get to me, and in my mania I tried to get to him before hiding in my bedroom. My husband was yelling my medical history and that I am fragile, he was saying he could get me to calmly get into the ambulance, but all I could see was the cops attacking him. Nevertheless, because my husband was begging me, I got on the gurney. Cops then grabbed each of my
Limbs, ripped them down and cuffed me to the gurney. Someone with Ms, EDS, a bad back and abdominal dysfunction like Me should not be strapped that way. My husband got fierce trying to stop the abuse and they pulled their guns on us. He surrendered and I fell further into the hysteria, fighting the cuffs and causing so much physical damage. The mental toll is unspeakable. They put me in the ambulance and took me to the psych wing of a hospital: they never checked my heart. My husband (who I should note is my legal caregiver and medical proxy) was denied coming with us.

In the hospital I was sent straight to the psych unit in the er. No one would listen to my medical issues and no one treated me for 15 hours. No water, I was left to soil myself, my ostomy bag popped and was left with waste all over me.

They hit me with 5 different chemical restraints and none of them worked, none of them slowed me down. Then they gave me a serotonin balancing injection. Within 1 hour I was back to normal and able to advocate for myself. 5 hours later I met with a psych via telehealth and was told they had no valid reason to detain or hold me. I was released without any looking at my heart or the symptoms that led to the event.

It took 4 months for the serotonin syndrome symptoms to go away, but nearly a year later I am still dealing with the fear and ptsd from what the cops did. If we weren‚Äôt white and from a wealthy neighborhood, both my husband and I are confident we‚Äôd be dead.

In follow up, my pain doctor didn‚Äôt even know what serotonin syndrome was. I‚Äôve had to educate him. It baffles me that they are playing fast and loose with these meds that can so affect us and our serotonin and yet they have no clue what it can do.

Also, despite the 51/50 being uncalled for and the 72 hour hold being failed, it will be on my record permanently and I will lose rights for it. Additionally, I have since learned that it is common for women in medical crisis to be 51/50d.

So please do some research on serotonin syndrome, because it‚Äôs a rising phenomenon with CPP and the way these drugs are prescribed to us sometimes. Serotonin syndrome is life threatening and can cause serious permanent damage and many ERs and doctors aren‚Äôt even very aware of it. My treatment ended up just being luck after much abuse. Please advocate for yourself to be taken off any of these meds that aren‚Äôt proven to help you (like your own proven experience).",post,r/ChronicPain,Health,40.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChronicPain/comments/1kzam8l/serotonin_syndrome/

It‚Äôs been confirmed serotonin syndrome and I was taken off all meds for a year. I had to do weekly blood draws and getting back to pain meds was hard.

"I'm at my wit's end It's been basically a decade of pain and disability for me. The doctors have settled into a diagnosis, just a herniated disc maybe with slight nerve impingement, but they agree that the imaging shows it wouldn't explain the level or type of pain I am feeling. So if it doesn't explain it, and they aren't looking for an explanation, do they think I'm making it up or do they just not care? All they do is tell me to lose weight. Well, I'm on weight loss drugs that aren't working, I can't exercise, and while food is the one occasional pleasure I have I don't eat significantly more than other people. Anything I've ever tried for pain hasn't worked, and some of it has even hurt me in the long run - liver and kidneys were damaged by tylenol and another medication I was on. Drs tell me the opiods make the pain worse over time so I got off those too, so there aren't really any more things to try for pain.

I'm tired. I'm tired of advocating for myself. The doctor's and specialist appointment's are too much effort, for no relief. I think I might be better off if I just stopped going. 

For those wondering, this is what I go through. At the start of the day all my joints are stiff, when I get out of bed my body is leaning to one side and I can't correct it, well I can but it is a process that takes an hour and is painful, after that, if that process went well after some recovery time I have a window where I can walk around the house (often cane assisted), over time my body gets crooked again and the pain ramps up and the only thing I can do is lie down, this has resulted in a sleep schedule where I basically sleep twice a day, The pain has gotten worse and affected different areas, my joints are showing osteoarthritis, probably from my body trying to adapt to an unnatural posture/gait. Now I'm also experiencing involuntary movements in my fingers, which I don't want to get worse since playing video games is about the one thing I can do during my day and I'd like to keep being able to do that.",post,r/ChronicPain,Health,12.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChronicPain/comments/1kzkfog/im_at_my_wits_end/
"Whether it helps or not, try to lose those excess pounds regardless. As one of my joint replacement surgeons once said, ""every pound of excess weight is equivalent to 20 additional pounds on damaged joints."" Ouch.

The other issue is opioids....yes, in certain people there is an ""effect"" related to these medications (whose name I've forgotten) which can cause greater sensitivity to pain. But as this certainly doesn't apply to everyone, I would strongly consider getting back on opioids. 

You're suffering, miserable, depressed, in terrible pain and your quality of life is greatly diminished, issues you shouldn't have to endure given the proper medications. And if you continue on this downward trajectory, even video games might become difficult to play and enjoy.

SI joint dysfunction (I dont walk right when that thing flares and does something to my back no idea what but it gets excruciating and I eat pain pills like candy when it happens). 

EDS- hypermobilty and a touch of vascular. Had to go to EDS clinic (virtual) and pay 600 out of pocket since my insurance didn't cover it and my healthcare clinic had no specialist for it.

2 herninated disc (arthritis)

MCAS - causes so much inflammation and i can't take ibuprofen or gabapentin due to other meds, slight allergy, and diverticulosis. 

Im still working through treatment road which is not over night.

My weight being extra is putting on to much stress. My symptoms got worse over the years of weight gain. I am on a 1400 calorie diet beciae yeah exercise does hurt and is hard to do. I dont have a high metabolism its that of a starving Eastern peasant.

Im so sorry you are going through this. It's hard and frustrating and I get just wanting it to stop. I hope you get some help and resolution.

"heating pad this might not be the right place but long story short, when i was in elementary school i went to physical therapy and there were these heating pads. they were white, i think weighted, maybe had beans or something in them, outline was blue, and the weight was sectioned into like big cylinders. something like this terrible drawing i drew. i‚Äôm looking for something like them because i want the feeling so bad again

white: cylinder shape

"Top 7 Ways to KILL Anxiety Hey guys, I used to be severely anxious and although i still experience it. Its very minor and simple to move past now. 

Here are the top 7 ways I have found to move past anxiety :)

1. Thought-Field-Therapy was the top #1 way hands down. Its similar to acue-puncture can learn to do yourself and so helpful at getting over anxiety easily. 

2. Training myself to breathe from my nose and stomach instead of mouth and chest was huge. 

3. I never cared much for walking, but now its became a daily must. Walking to listening to music. Clears my mind and uplifts my mood. 

4. Meditation, pretty self explanatory

5. The top 4 are the best byt I took ashwaghanda to boost my testosterone higher and found a very noticeable reduction in anxiety!

6. I know much of anxiety feels uncontrollable but if there is some where simple courage can do overcome it, Thats been very good. 

7. Reduce anxiety triggers! Things that often make you anxious that are uncessary to do. Dont limit yourself but if you can easily remove it, do so.

"Going for a walk in the morning does help in making you feel better So I deal with morning anxiety most of the time. I wake up jittery, overthinking, ruminating, etc. I usually just let it go by itself, but yesterday I thought ""no, I won't let it control me"" so I got up, put on my shoes and went outside for a walk. 

There's a park close to my house so I just went there and walked around the park, over and over and over, and it does help. A lot! My anxiety went down, I wasn't ruminating or overthinking and looking around does help in getting your mind off of things. 

Other thing that helped me was to send voice notes to my mom. I just start talking about anything and send it to her. I end up making a full podcast, but she's happy to hear all of it. Since me being alone is one of my triggers for anxiety, talking and being listened (even if it's online) helps in calming me down.

"In Denial Over Medication? I am in an IOP program right now. Part of the program that I‚Äôm in is medication management. I had a conversation with the nurse practitioner who runs the program on Friday. She basically was like ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think your problem is going to be solved just by you doing these different things without medication‚Äù And then went on to ask me how long I‚Äôve been dealing with this. Which I‚Äôve had lifelong anxiety.
And I guess I‚Äôm feeling very mixed about all of this. I told her I feel like we over prescribed people medication she said she agrees.
I guess what I‚Äôm struggling with is when I look back at my life I feel like the first 18 years were really stressful living with my parents. My parents didn‚Äôt have a super healthy relationship growing up. Then the next four years or so I was trying to navigate becoming a young adult And that is also very stressful.  honestly, before Covid hit I was doing really good with my anxiety and depression. I was doing things in life and I wasn‚Äôt questioning them. Then Covid hit and the wheels fell off for everybody. I found it to be especially hard for me to cope with a car accident and an abusive relationship.
Last week I was talking with my therapist about how I‚Äôve been very codependent with my aunt. (Aunt has unmanaged diabeties and talks about spiraling thoughts 24/7) And this has been really hard for me to kind of accept because she‚Äôs not wrong, but I think it makes sense as to what‚Äôs going on and way that I‚Äôm feeling. And I guess I‚Äôve also been in that relationship for the last five years.

So I guess when I‚Äôm sort of getting out here is I think it‚Äôs sort of unfair to say that I need to take a medication for my stress and anxiety. It‚Äôs not like I haven‚Äôt been in very stressful situations the whole time. And I‚Äôm working really hard right now to change my environment. I‚Äôm already starting to feel a lot more independence.

"Does anyone else also have dysautonomia? Hi there,
I've been having a hard time accepting that I have anxiety.
The anxiety attacks feel very similar to dysautonomic flare ups except I can identify there's an emotional trigger. 
Unlike the dysautonomic episodes, I can't just lie down and wait because it can continue when I'm doing all my usual physical manoveres. And I am more distressed because of the, you know, anxiety. 
When I was first diagnosed with dysautonomia and Ehlers danlos syndrome, a lot of community sentiment was that my problems are purely physical. That our my mind at ease and did help my health at the time.
But now I can't escape it. I've got mental illness too. 
Does anyone else have experience with dysautonomia as well? Or another physical condition that they were told by doctors they didn't have to worry because their symptoms are caused by this thing instead. 
How do I accept the anxiety and what measures do I take to relieve anxiety attacks?
Thank you",post,r/Anxiety,Health,3.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1l0bqsg/does_anyone_else_also_have_dysautonomia/

I think you'll get some great advice on navigating anxiety attacks by using the search function. My disorders are all treatment resistant, so I need to take Xanax or Ativan, and that means I won't be much help there.

"Long QT is probably medication induced. It has to run in your family to be the dangerous genetic kind. And because you‚Äôve probably never heard of anyone in your family fainting or dying from long QT syndrome, it‚Äôs more than likely medication induced. Psychiatric medications, antihistamines, a whole range of medications cause long QT syndrome. As soon as you‚Äôre off your Lexapro and you‚Äôve worn your heart monitor for a while. And the QT shortens they then know it was caused by your Lexapro. Because this anomaly showed while you were taking a medication, you will need to google all medication‚Äòs from here on out to determine if they cause long QT syndrome and if they do, you can‚Äôt take them.

It‚Äôs possible that this is true, and the reason he can‚Äôt list examples is because the behaviour is being picked up on by the subconscious (like when you meet someone and they give you bad vibes). It could be the cadence of your voice, how you‚Äôre holding yourself (are you tense?), looking around a lot instead of looking at who‚Äôs talking, things like that. 

Is he saying that you always seem anxious, even when it‚Äôs just the two of you at home? It may be that he‚Äôs overly aware of your anxiety disorder, and so is having his own anxiety about how you‚Äôre feeling, even when you‚Äôre fine.

"Silly and loving it! Using my body to interrupt anxious feelings. I like to incorporate inappropriate yet wholesome bodily actions in my day. These include humming, skipping, dancing, smiling and clapping. These encourage the body to feel joyful (it is not common to be joyful and anxious at the same time).

When smiling on purpose the brain makes me feel better. When clapping like something great is happening, the brain makes me look for things to feel good about. 

Example 1. I go for a nature walk and nobody is around. I use my body to elevate mood. It's actually pretty hard not to feel good when humming and skipping in nature. I am M(41) and do this. :) 

Example 2. Not looking forward to work in the morning. I pause, slowing down my anxious rush. I can humm a tune or play music, and dance while preparing breakfast. Then clap my hands while thinking about the best part of my job, like helping people. On the way to the car, smile and skip.

Offered me temporary relief...

In recent years, it's settled in an interstitial layer of my abdomen, right in front of my bladder, very diffuse, one of which I have no conscious control over, that starts imperceptibly then builds throughout the days without my knowing.

"Redditor in Recovery in need of help/advice/support/wisdom about an upcoming flight & a (potentially) prescribed benzodiazepine. I‚Äôm going to be getting on a flight next week and will be needing to fly back in a few days after that. I‚Äôve done quite a few flights but i‚Äôm terrified of crashing and dying. I‚Äôm worried about having a panic attack at the airport or on the plane. I‚Äôm wondering what the chances of my doctor prescribing just 2 pills one for the way there and one for the flight back.   
  
All that being said, my doctor knows I‚Äôm in recovery and staying in a sober living house. She knows that I was prescribed Alprazolam by my last doctor. She also knows that I was abusing RC benzo pressed pills off the street such as fluaprazolam and or eitizolam or bromazolam or something totally different. She knows I‚Äôm coming up on 8 months clean next week. I‚Äôm already on 1800 mgs of Gabapentin daily, Clonidine, Hydroxyzine and Olanzapine.  
  
 I can‚Äôt/ don‚Äôt want to use CBD/THC or Kava. I‚Äôve already been on Propananol, Buspar. If she does agree to this, what would be the best benzo to ask for? I was prescribe 0.5mg alps but am worried that anything under 1mg won‚Äôt really help. I took Ativan in the past and I think that helps a little bit more but not by much. What about Valium?  Klonopin doesn‚Äôt really help me either. I took Oxazepam a few times in detox and think that really helped me. What do you guys think is best? I‚Äôm also considering buying an Ambien or two off a friend but idk how much those will help (I‚Äôm aware they‚Äôre not actually benzos) as the only other time I‚Äôve taken them was 15 years or so with the goal of tripping. My goal/intent is not catch a buzz or get high in any way. I‚Äôll have 8 months clean next week. I just don‚Äôt want to have a panic attack on the plane. Can anyone relate?

"Anxiety has been absolutely unbearable after accident and during crisis. As the title says my axiety has been unbearable and I'm unsure of what to do. I have tried everything to calm myself down but it just seems like nothing works. I've always had anxiety but it's gotten so much worse than ever before. Everything gets to me and I cannot focus on anything else. I have been diagnosed in the past with Anxiety, depression and PTSD.

My family is going through an extremely hard time right now, but what really triggered it was when I was in a very bad car accident back in October. A truck was coming off the interstate and didn't stop on the ramp and just turned right into traffic going almost 70 mph which was where I was. His truck hit me almost head on where I was passing by when he was exiting the ramp and turning right. I had no time to brake before impact. I was by myself and it was terrifying, thank goodness I was in an explorer because the whole entire front end of my vehicle was caved in and ripped apart. The airbags deployed and I tried to jump out as quickly as possible but my door wouldn't open all the way and I had to squeeze out and somehow I did. 

I was so scared and now to this day I have nightmares about it and wonder what I could have done differently. It totaled our only vehicle we owned and was so disappointing. I have bad panic attacks now and never did before. I cannot afford therapy or a psychiatrist, even if I could I wouldn't have a way there. We have no income at all right now because we both lost our jobs due to not having transportation and I know my situation is just making it even worse, if you want to know how bad our situation is I made another post a while ago and it can be found on my profile, I don't want to go through all that here. I'm also very depressed and just feel hopeless, I miss my old self and I'm afraid I'll never be myself again.

"had my first intervention about my mental health I know it comes from a place of love and concern but I feel more judged and misunderstood than before. My friends have been talking about me behind my back, asking the other to not invite me to things because they noticed I'm withdrawn and quiet and not a part of the conversation and that makes them uncomfortable I guess, that I'm just there? like I thought it was better to atleast show up even if you're not feeling 100%. I know I check out a lot and disassociate lately and haven't been good at initiating conversation or making plans, but instead of asking me what's going on up until right now, its just suddenly I'm just being uninvited to things. I've been feeling like im not valued or people don't care what I have to say all my life, so I have naturally become a quiet person. And I don't have the energy to initiate plans and be social like I used to a couple uears ago when i was in a better place. People change. My mental health has been going downhill for the past couple years. I have fallen into a depressive slump because things in my life just kept getting worse and worse physically and mentally. I'm just now starting medication and counseling and trying to get my life together. I know my friend needed to get their feelings off their chest, but I didn't need an intervention right now. I know she meant well, but some of it came across as insensitive. Nobody knows exactly what the other is going through. She was like ""me and our other friend have full time jobs and still see eachother once a week, you're unemployed at home doing what exactly?""... I just started disassociating and checking out.  That comment felt rude... I have so much on my mind all the time driving me crazy,, I haven't had time for investing in other people as much.

These are things that were recommended by my doctor and therapist. Additionally, see if you can get a vitamin panel done. Being deficient or having too high of something can trigger things. I found out recently I‚Äôm vitamin D deficient.

"Feeling like Nobody Cares? - Mental Health Middleman: Free Advice From a Therapist Welcome to a new little project I'm starting called **Mental Health Middleman**, where I pay for therapy then share the advice I'm given to you - free of charge. I hate when healing is hidden behind a paywall, so if any shred of information I've learned can be helpful to me, I hope that if can help the greater good.

Today's tough topic was **Feeling like Nobody Cares** when you need your friends for support.

\‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

*How today's session went:*  
*I've been experiencing a lot of BIG TRAUMAS\*\***^(TM)* *lately, and it seems like I've been doing nothing but screaming into the void for support. My closest friends pretend everything is normal, moved on way quicker than I would have preferred, and from some -  just radio silence. I shared this with my therapist, kind of at my breaking point feeling like, ""Nobody actually cares. Do they not realize I'm like at my breaking point?""*

Spoiler Alert: They did not, if fact, realize this.

My therapist, who knows me quite well, let me vent before asking, **""If asked, how would your friends describe you?""** Suspiciously, I listed off the words that I heard the most from my friends: **independent, motivated, strong.**

With the joy of winning in her eye, she responds ""Exactly! You're friends know you as the capable one. The one with her s\*\*\* together. The one that *they* go to for support. The fixer. The one who never has asked for help. **They aren't there for you right now, not because they don't want to be - but because they don't** ***think you need it!""***

I wanted to have a comeback, something along the lines of ""no, nobody cares about me blah blah blah"", but it struck me silent. She was right. That is exactly how the people in my life have viewed me - and it was all because that is the image I carefully crafted for myself.

She then introduced me to the **Silent Scream** \- something we have all done (especially if you grew up as a millennial with unmonitored access to social media for the first time). A silent scream is when we do things with the intention to get the attention of others when we are hurting. It's a cry for help without every uttering the words ""I need help"". Some examples might be: 

* Posting sad songs or quotes on social media so that people reach out and ask what is wrong
* Intentionally canceling plans or not showing up without notice so others ask why
* Exaggerating or faking illnesses for sympathy, etc.

Now these things aren't always inherently bad, and rather innocent for the most part, the issue is that we never directly ask for help. While we've all done these things, and to us it might be blatantly clear that we are in crisis - the thing about them is they are *silent.* **So most people, even if they are very close to you, don't even recognize it is happening.** Therefore, the silent scream has no real power. 

\‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

**But what if i am asking - point blank - for help from my friends?**

I asked this, because I truly had gone directly to friends and tried to be blunt about what I was going through. While I was shown a bit of support, I still felt that they were uncomfortable, or rather didn't want to speak on it. 

My therapist had a very insightful response. 

*Whether it is known to them or not, people subconsciously get used to constants in their life - and that includes people's personalities and behaviors. They know, in the back of their mind, that you are the strong and independent one. It is something they can rely on to be as consistent as the grass is green. To see something that they are so fundamentally used to change so drastically kind of puts their own reality into a spin. Humans are wired to fear change. It is not intentional. It‚Äôs more that they don't know how to process that information immediately. And if that person is going through some of their own mental struggles, that unease is exaggerated. That's not to say that you aren't entitled to change, to have your own desire for support and love. But I promise you that they do care*

\‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

So what‚Äôs our takeaway?
When you feel alone, or like you have no one who supports you, remember who you are. How the people around you see you. Be that person. Even when it‚Äôs hard. Even if you don‚Äôt feel like that person anymore. Be the person that they see you as.",post,r/Anxiety,Health,0.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1l0ck1e/feeling_like_nobody_cares_mental_health_middleman/

"Heart palpitation Hey guys! I'm really having hard time with heart palpitation this week. It started with messed up sleep schedule until i couldn't sleep enough anymore, i mean barley 4-6 hours a day.

The other problem is that the  palpitation happens also in day time out of nowhere. 
So please if you had this experience plz any advice would be appreciated, knowing that i'm   really under stress the past years and sometimes i think i migh die and even get some hallucinations that i'm about to faint.

I need someone. I‚Äôm crying in bed right now. If anyone has any tips or up lifting words that could help me right now I would very much appreciate it. I want to feel like myself again.

"Oooff. First of all deep breaths, you got this. 

Second, I would see your doc again. The symptoms you are mentioning yes can be associated with anxiety however it would still be worth talking to your doc about in case there is something physical. There are a few things I can think of that wouldn't be picked up in blood work but would be causing these symptoms. Migraines etc, your doc may want to check out more especially having symptoms for so long. 

Alternatively, I would like to ask, respectfully of course, have you or are you attending counseling? In my personal experience before my PTSD diagnosis I hadn't realized that my anxiety had me running so hard that myself care was lacking. Thus I experience the same symptoms but due to lack of a healthy diet or remembering to eat, no consistent sleep schedule and constant high stress. This unfortunately is not a quick fix however is something that can be overcome.

I am truly sorry you are feeling so unwell right now.",comment_1,r/Anxiety,Health,,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1kzxyi7/i_need_a_hug_please_read/
"Hey, anxiety is the most scariest when you first get it because you dont know what to do and you are overwhelmed with these dreadful sensations you never knew existed. You will 100% find a way to make it better to an acceptable level where you can enjoy life again.

Health anxiety is exhausting. At the peak and beginning of my anxiety, I was OBSESSED with googling symptoms and diagnosing myself of pretty much every illness out there. I would be obsessed with one illness this week, get tests done which show as negative, dont believe doctors or results and then move onto the next illness. 

This was just a symptom of having an anxiety disorder and went away completely after I started anxiety medication (SSRIs - not benzos). 

Nausea is super common when youre anxious and especially in the morning. My primary symptom when I get severe anxiety or panic is vomiting - just violent and repeated dry-retching. But you want to make sure its not something else. I have done a million tests in my gut because I refused to believe it was my mind causing me nausea so I 100% know its my anxiety causing it. So do yours to make sure its not some physiological problem - gastritis or ulcer etc

I have acid reflux so whenever I sleep after a rich meal or overeat, I sometimes wake up in the middle of the night with intense nausea that Id need to start dry-retching. So I always sleep after the food has digested, no nausea and some water. 

Ive never experienced dizziness though. 

Start recording your symptoms. I have over thousands of data points on an excel file where I record my nausea levels, digestion, anxiety and depression throughout the years which have been really helpful to understand patterns and causes. 

Most importantly, accept anxiety. Dont try to play mind tricks to avoid it. Stop trying to make it go away. Let it do its thing to your mind and body. Its bloody scary and hard to do but open the door for it. 

You got this.",comment_2,r/Anxiety,Health,,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1kzxyi7/i_need_a_hug_please_read/

"Psoas Muscle and Anxiety Hello!  I'm a male in my late 30s.  No health issues other than constant anxiety. I recently discovered the connection between anxiety and the Psoas muscle.  Anytime in my life that I experienced anxiety I will always get this weird tightness in my lower abdomen/pelvic area.  It wasn't quite pain but almost like my belt was too tight or was squeezing. It would lead to me becoming more anxious and then more tense....and over and over again.

I researched the psoas muscle and how to locate it and once I felt where it was, I realized they are exactly in the spot where I would feel this muscle.  I also learned it has a lot to do with your breathing and digestive issues that come along with stress and anxiety.  

I wanted to share some of that info with anyone else that may experience that and not know the connection",post,r/Anxiety,Health,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1l0c08e/psoas_muscle_and_anxiety/
"Air hunger OCD I had a panic attack (my first one) a couple months ago after I choked on some food. It sent me into a panic attack & ever since, i‚Äôve had this weird obsession with taking deep breaths. Every 30 seconds I feel the need to take a deep breath. Right when I wake up it‚Äôs all I think about to the time I go to bed. It‚Äôs been going on for a couple months with some days better than others. When i‚Äôm distracted , I don‚Äôt do it or notice it. Has anyone experienced this?

"Literally the same thing. Literally! When it started it was so bad even my back hurt from trying to breath so hard.¬†

Started to work on that, here is what I did:
1. Started taking B complex as a supplement (it helps your nervous system a ton)
2. Was already taking magnesium but continued to do so (makes you relax)
3. Buteyko breathing 3 times a day
4. Exposure reaction therapy 3 times a day
5. Stretching 3 times a day

You will realise that it isn't natural to breath deep all the time, it's just your nervous system ""checking and finding safety"". By those breathing exercises you will show your nervous system that it is okay to breath normally and that not every. single. breath has to be deep.

Even today I still have to ""check"" my breathing every few minutes but now 99% of times my breath is full/deep. Times when I get ""not full"" breath I don't even react, I ignore it completely.¬†

Of course, do medical check ups first to be sure it's anxiety.

"Take the plunge, try something new I‚Äôve been very eh with my long time studio for awhile now. I think it may be partially a me issue changing over the past several years and no longer being into hot classes and the like. I‚Äôve really gotten into the gentle, restorative and yin kind of classes. In general I‚Äôve noticed myself making excuses about going especially if it is a hot or power class, and then over this past month they started to take gentle classes off the schedule altogether during the times I can attend. I‚Äôve been devoted to this place for a long time mainly to support the owner who I‚Äôve known since basically I started yoga 15 years ago.  However when they removed these classes it was a wake up call. I can‚Äôt justify a pricey membership to attend once or twice a week or go to classes I no longer love.

I decided to check out a new studio today and talk about night and day difference in a good way!

The owner actually called me to introduce themself before I signed up for the intro and to get to know me a little. I gave them an idea of when I would be able to begin and they texted to check in right before. (Never have experienced this ever and I think this is amazing to make new people feel at ease). 

When I showed up today they were so friendly and even asked if they could give me a hug to welcome me to the studio.

I felt at ease immediately, the class was exactly as described and what I‚Äôm looking for and I cannot wait to go back for another class.

Other studios I‚Äôve attended I feel like teachers are friendly enough but this was a whole different vibe in such a positive way. I also got a very welcoming vibe with the students who were there.

I just wanted to share because I feel like a lot on this sub people feel committed to a studio and are anxious about changing to somewhere new.

"Can Yoga Be Practiced Without a Flow? I‚Äôm new to yoga and have been following a 20-minute yoga practice posted by a YouTuber for the past month. After doing it regularly, I started to feel really good, and now I‚Äôm thinking about leveling up my practice.

While looking for new routines, I noticed that many yoga videos on YouTube are like a dance ‚Äî you have to remember all the poses in a specific order. I‚Äôd like to know: is it possible to practice yoga using individual poses without following a set flow?",post,r/Yoga,Health,23.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/yoga/comments/1kzt7wh/can_yoga_be_practiced_without_a_flow/
"Hi !
There are different types of yoga, which will have different postural practices: in rhythm, in intention, in objective.

To sum it up quite simply:
In static yoga:
- Hatha Yoga: The postures are performed one after the other (normally in the tradition we return to Tadasana between each). Each posture will be held consciously for 5 breaths. (This is a great practice when you're starting out because it allows you to really take the time to understand your body, to understand the postures and above all to calm your breathing)
- Yin Yoga: There, we settle into postures on the ground, for much longer (3 to 5 minutes, or even more!). It is an introspective yoga that highlights silence and slowness. He works on letting go, ‚Äúdoing nothing‚Äù. The body relaxes and so does the mind.
- Restorative Yoga: Ultra gentle, perfect for nerve recovery. We settle into postures supported by cushions and we stay there, almost in meditation! It‚Äôs a real cocooning moment. Perfect when you're tired.

In dynamic yoga:
- Ashtanga - series of postures linked together always in the same order (there are several series, but the order of the postures never changes). It focuses on alignment + breathing, it is one of the most demanding yogas.
- Vinyasa Yoga: more modern, it is very widespread on social networks (very aesthetic!). It is also a sequence of postures, guided by breathing. But much more creative (teachers create their lessons as they want) it‚Äôs cool for a little change! (You can often find them by typing yoga flow on YouTube)

There are plenty more!
I just wanted to add one last thing, yoga is NOT JUST postural practice! (Otherwise it would be gym) it's the addition of body awareness, withdrawal of the mind and senses, meditation, control of breathing...that makes it yoga!

The goal of postural practice is actually to prepare the body and mind for meditation!

=> So yes! ‚ò∫Ô∏è Yoga can be ‚Äúyoga‚Äù even without a workout! And even by doing a single posture for 50 minutes since you will work the mind, the breath, and the body!

"So a query about Yoga... So I've been doing yoga 4 times a week for the last 3-4 months. I feel healthy and nimble and it's done so much for me. 

My query is whether it can affect someone who practices regularly, that if they don't keep up, they start to get bored and tired - like a general malaise. It's like if I miss a practice or something I feel completely out of kilter, even if I don't miss a practice, I still feel a little out of sorts. 

Does this mean I need to start doing yoga everyday to feel normal? 

Sorry for the random and weird question, just want to see if anyone relates?

"After a 2 week break from any exercise, I finally lowered myself to a chaturanga! I‚Äôm a lifelong wimp and a relative newbie to fitness in general. I‚Äôve been doing a mix of light weightlifting, circuit training, and yoga for the past 3 months semi-regularly, with plenty of rest in between. I put all that on pause for a couple weeks with my husband getting admitted in the ICU. Since he‚Äôs been feeling better and had another person stay with him at the hospital, I felt I could finally relax a little bit and decided to go back to attend my usual heated vinyasa class. 

I‚Äôve always done the knee modification for chaturanga, and even then I had to go down really slowly and exert a lot of effort to lower myself in the correct form. I would attempt the full chaturanga every now and then to no avail. So I came into class yesterday tired and not feeling the best physically and mentally from the husband situation, but for some reason when we went into the first vinyasa, without thinking I lowered myself without the knee modification. To my absolute surprise, I could do it with very little effort! I was elated and wanted to laugh-scream (but didn‚Äôt)! Of course as the class went on I got more tired and I had to revert to the knee modification by the time the fifth vinyasa rolled in. 

But how was this possible? I did absolutely zero exercise during this 2 week period (excluding walking the dog and running errands, which aren‚Äôt much). I didn‚Äôt lose a significant amount of weight, and I‚Äôve been eating more crappy fast food. I expected to be in much worse shape, what with the stress and all.

"Can someone please ELI5 on how strengthening a muscle, like hamstrings, results in greater stretching capacity? I vaguely recall the explanation is that it takes the load off the countering muscle to relax and allow for greater flexibility gains. 

Let's take the ham. It is weak therefore unstable. And so if you attempt to stretch it, it will not stretch because... the countering muscle, say quads/glutes, will actively press back to prevent the stretch? 

Or do i have it wrong? In this case, the quads/glutes must become strong in order for them to pull on the hamstrings, allowing for a deeper stretch. Is that right? Thank you.",post,r/Yoga,Health,6.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/yoga/comments/1kzdsvx/can_someone_please_eli5_on_how_strengthening_a/
I've heard it explained that a stronger muscle doesn't need to contract as hard to get the same amount of stability as a weaker muscle. Thus a stronger muscle is more relaxed and more able to stretch than a constantly tense weaker muscle.,comment_1,r/Yoga,Health,,https://www.reddit.com/r/yoga/comments/1kzdsvx/can_someone_please_eli5_on_how_strengthening_a/
Flexibility is kinda just strength in a wider ROM,comment_2,r/Yoga,Health,,https://www.reddit.com/r/yoga/comments/1kzdsvx/can_someone_please_eli5_on_how_strengthening_a/
"A lot of flexibility doesn‚Äôt come from ‚Äòstretching the muscle‚Äô, rather learn to let go of tension in the incorrect areas and learn to engage the correct muscles to enter the pose. An easy example:

Forward Fold:
- Tight muscles around your feet, groins, hips, even your diaphragm neck and shoulders need to learn to initially loosen
- Strong legs and contracted thighs are required to keep your body standing firmly and balanced, so you are not hyperextending your knees or putting unnecessary weight on your ankles


Your hamstring quad analogy is correct. Because they are opposite muscles, the quad stretches when the hamstring engages and vice versa, the hamstring stretches when the quad engages",comment_3,r/Yoga,Health,,https://www.reddit.com/r/yoga/comments/1kzdsvx/can_someone_please_eli5_on_how_strengthening_a/
"The sign of a healthy muscle is how well it stretches AND contracts. A lot of gym junkies are comparatively weak in this regard because they just ""pump"", or contract muscles over and over again. Compare the power they generate to an Olympic sprinter or gymnast, who may not be as physically big but have real, functional, effortless strength.

It gets complicated but on a physiological level there are many different types of stretches... It doesn't just mean muscle lengthening. In fact it can actually mean the opposite. eg:

An **Isotonic Concentric Contraction** is your classic ""pump""... think of your bicep doing a dumbbell curl. The muscle contracts and gets physically shorter.

But then there's **Isotonic Eccentric Contraction**, where *the muscle's overall length actually increases while the muscle itself contracts*, like when you lower the dumbbell curl. This is why personal trainers tell you to lower weights with control, don't just drop them.

There's also **Isometric Contraction** where the muscle contracts but the overall muscle length stays the same. Like in a high plank, where you're holding tone but the overall length doesn't change.

So the short answer is a healthy muscle is one that is bouncy but also has the ability to hold tone.",comment_4,r/Yoga,Health,,https://www.reddit.com/r/yoga/comments/1kzdsvx/can_someone_please_eli5_on_how_strengthening_a/

"How do you feel afterwards? After the session, an hour later, hours later, a few days?

If you feel overall calmer, better, then yes, you are releasing. (Sometimes, feelings may still peak after practice, so it may even be worth to keep a journal).

Even if you feel better, you don‚Äôt have to go deeper or continue. You can pause for a while or stop entirely. You get the final say in what is right for you.

You can also set an intent before your practice like ‚Äúgentle release only‚Äù, which if you practice setting intents before practice, your mind and body will begin to honor them, so you can continue your practice in a safe way that you get to control better.

But also, if you have never released this, once you start to let go, more things can surface because they see an opportunity for their chance to be ‚Äúheard‚Äù. If more things come up, it doesn‚Äôt mean you are doing anything wrong, you are getting better at creating a supportive space for yourself. Over time you will make progress.

Additionally, trauma is stored in layers, so even if you have a big release, you may find you still have more to work through. It is not a sign that you are not being successful. Trust yourself and how you feel overall.

If you feel worse, overwhelmed, or want more support, you can find a professional to work with. I‚Äôd look for someone who has ‚Äútrauma-informed‚Äù as part of their training. But you can look into somatic work but also possibly psychology like EMDR, whatever is right for you, there are a lot of options and sometimes it takes a few attempts to learn what process is best for you.

If this is not the right time for you to work on this stuff it is ok. You can always return to it at a later time.

"Hurt myself doing shoulder dips from tented-fingertips sphinx pose. Now curious to learn more subtleties/effects of the patterns of the physical body Hello! Years back I was in an accelerative chronic shoulder pain issue. Most days a sharp pain on the top of my shoulder was getting worse, and it was making it hard for me to sleep (yes hello I am a side sleeper). Uneducated on the details of internal and external rotation, and the merits of practicing both, I was developing a bone spur on my collar bone from the friction of my shoulder on my collar bone from an excess of internal rotation. (I am a very internally rotated person, as a climber and a person who‚Äôs had spinal surgery and a kyphotic vertebra). At this point I don‚Äôt think I yet comprehended external rotation, in my physical patterns or even conceptually. 

Prior to taking matters into my own hands I actually got an x ray because the bone spur was sticking out a bit, and all the regular western medicine route had for me was ‚Äúyep, that‚Äôs a bone spur, you can have surgery if it‚Äôs too painful‚Äù‚Äî but I‚Äôm really grateful that I was able to seek support from a friend who‚Äôs a body worker (she is a genius structural integration professional), and yoga teachers who talked about external rotation. They taught me and brought me out and away from acute and intensifying pain. It was a long road de-patterning some of my internal rotation habits, and I still have tender shoulders to this day, but my bone spur stopped growing and the pain lessened within a couple months of diving deep on learning external rotation. I have been much better off ever since. 

I still abstain from dramatic internal rotation extremes, like when planting fingertips off to the side of the mat and doing shoulder dips from cobra or sphinx. This was a move that had felt relieving to my pains before I understood them, but was actually exacerbating my issue! This movement also comes up in goddess, and I skip it‚Äî the shoulder dips are more extreme internal rotation I need in my practice. 

I am telling this story because I am interested to hear of other experiences comparable to this. It could be about any body part, but I‚Äôm interested to hear about movement patterns that were subtly (or not-so-subtly) hurting you, which you may or may not have been able to re-route by educating yourself and/or altering your typical movement patterns.

"Need help with alternative for pigeon pose variations Hello all!

I'm in a bit of a quandary, and I was hoping you'd be able to help me.

Here's my background: I'm a 42 year old male. I lift weights a lot, I walk a lot, I swim once or twice a week, and I go to yoga once or twice a week. I've been active for most of my life, and while I'd never say that I have bad knees because I don't, I will admit to having 42 year old knees.

I started yoga a couple years ago due to some hip and hamstring flexibility issues, and it's been a great help and I've fallen in love with it. 

I have pretty consistently had trouble with resting half pigeon, especially on my left side. Basically, it makes my knee hurt. I worked on the posture, worked on my hip flexibility, and it really improved... on my right side. The left has always been more troublesome. Sometimes resting half pigeon is great, and I feel the stretch fully in my hips. More often, it feels like all the stress is hitting my knee, and no amount of adjusting in the pose seems to help. I will usually move into an alternate pose like seated figure 4 when that happens, and it feels better.

So a couple weeks ago in class, we were doing double pigeon. I took it very slow, had the block ready, and by some apparent miracle, I was able to get into the pose with no pain. It felt great. Until we tried it on the left side. I got in the pose, no knee pain, everything is good, and then my left knee clicks in a way I've never felt it click before. It didn't hurt at all, but I thought, ""I bet I'm gonna feel that tomorrow."" 

Ever since, I've been unable to get into any pigeon variation on my left side without a good amount of pain in my knee. That's the only time it bothers me as well, it's completely fine with everything else.

Today, I was doing some stretching after leg day lifts (none of which have ever caused me any knee issues and my left knee felt great throughout the entire session). I did resting half pigeon on my right side with no problem. Left side: problem. I tried getting into seated figure 4 as an alternative, but that caused knee pain as well.

What I would like to know is this: what alternate poses can I do that stretch the same part of the hip as pigeon but that don't put strain on the knee?

I'm fine with my body being asymmetrical in its ability to do this, but I don't want to have a significant flexibility imbalance. I just want to be able to keep my hips stretched. That's it.

My heel is perilously close to my groin. I teach and have been practicing for 13 years.,comment_2,r/Yoga,Health,,https://www.reddit.com/r/yoga/comments/1kz43ns/need_help_with_alternative_for_pigeon_pose/
"Pigeon pose can seriously mess up your knees.
Think about it: you‚Äôre basically sitting cross-legged, but dumping all your body weight onto one side - and expecting your knee to be happy with that?

Knee pain = too much weight on the joint.
Not your fault. Most teachers don‚Äôt know how to teach pigeon. They tell you to ‚Äúsink into your hips,‚Äù which just means collapse into your knee, instead of ‚Äúlift up and forward‚Äù.

Here‚Äôs what to actually do:

‚Ä¢ Put a block (medium or high) or blankets under the bent-leg hip.

‚Ä¢ Focus on lifting through your spine - stretch up and then forward, not down. Don‚Äôt curl into a ball.

‚Ä¢ Your bent leg should support you and lift you up, not be dead weight.

‚Ä¢ Elongate your low spine and keep space between your ribs all the way to your tailbone - don‚Äôt just flop forward.

Even in reclined figure 4, if you focus more on pulling your leg in without considering your spinal integrity, you will continue to experience knee pain.

Stop sinking. Use props. Fix the form or ditch the pose altogether.

Struggling with bakasana Hi guys! Practicing consistently for about 1.5 years. I‚Äôve been really struggling to get into bakasana. I recently attempted to get into the pose and ended up injuring my bicep tendon in the process. I‚Äôve attempted it many times both practicing in-class and at home and it seems like my body is telling me the pose might not be something I can accomplish. It‚Äôs really frustrating because I want to do inversions and bakasana is a good starting point. Feeling pretty let down with my progress. Anyone have any advice?,post,r/Yoga,Health,7.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/yoga/comments/1kz3e3f/struggling_with_bakasana/
"I‚Äôm not sure Bakasana is that helpful for headstand/ handstand / forearm stand so don‚Äôt be put off trying different things. I know people who find side crow much easier than regular crow, and who can do headstand and pincha mayurasana but can‚Äôt balance in Bakasana (yet). So don‚Äôt feel that if you‚Äôre struggling with this pose then no other inversions or arm balances are available to you - it‚Äôs not a linear progression.¬†

If you want to keep working on Bakasana, then the yogi flight school tutorials on YouTube¬†are very good at explaining the mechanics, imo. What helped me was 1) you have to tip further forward than you think - put a cushion in front of you if you‚Äôre scared. 2) Active fingers stop you from falling, 3) look forward not down, 4) if putting your knees on the back of your arms hurts, widen your legs so your knees are outside your arms.¬†",comment_1,r/Yoga,Health,,https://www.reddit.com/r/yoga/comments/1kz3e3f/struggling_with_bakasana/
"\> injuring my bicep tendon in the process

I think there's a meta problem where you need to prioritize how to practice and progress in a way that minimizes injury. Focus on stability and slowness. Break everything up into steps and only progress to the next step when you're stabilized and prioritized static strength..",comment_2,r/Yoga,Health,,https://www.reddit.com/r/yoga/comments/1kz3e3f/struggling_with_bakasana/
"Personally, I don‚Äôt think bakasana is a good starting point for inversions. I think half handstand would be better. Start in a short down dog facing away from a wall and then walk your feet up the wall until your legs and torso are at right angles. Maybe lift one leg at a time. Stay for a few breaths and then walk the feet down and then rest in child‚Äôs pose. 

As for bakasana, I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôve seen YouTube videos of how to get into the pose. The instructions that helped me was to get your hips up, then to move your head and torso a little forward not to just try lift the feet up. Hope this helps.",comment_3,r/Yoga,Health,,https://www.reddit.com/r/yoga/comments/1kz3e3f/struggling_with_bakasana/

"What would you charge for a puppy yoga class? I volunteer at a severely underfunded animal shelter. We just busted a puppy mill (we are part of city animal control) and have puppies out the wazoo. I only do yoga causally, but my friend is a certified instructor and offered to lead the class. 

All proceeds will go to the shelter. They have a very nice outdoor turf area (that I'll scrub and sanitize myself, lol.) I initially thought like $10/pp, but I'm seeing local puppy yoga places charging $50-100/pp and just keeping the profits or paying the breeders for loaning them puppies. 

We can fit about 30 people, and even a $300 fundraiser would be incredible. But if I can get more, I obviously want to. 

EDIT: thanks for all the helpful responses. I'm thinking a ""$25 suggested donation"" with Venmo codes and cash jars available for extra donations during the class. I'm fairly certain I can get a local business to donate scones and coffee for after the class that I would probably have for a $5 suggested donation. And while I'd love to do multiple classes, hopefully everyone gets adopted after the first one! 

EDIT 2: this is a public, taxpayer funded shelter. A lot of people are suggesting we just sell tickets... that gets tricky. Income has to be from donations or the city. Places like the ASPCA are private and can sell merch, event tickets, etc. We could maybe get away with ""minimum donation"" language, but it has to be clear that it's a voluntary donation. If a yoga studio were hosting it with our animals, then they could sell tickets and donate to us.

"How to prepare a vinyasa class Hi! I have a question, especially for my fellow vinyasa teachers....
Can you tell me more about how you prepare a class? I am not a new teacher, also not super experienced yet, but I feel like I'm still spending so much time preparing the asana flows for my weekly classes. How do you do it? What are your methods to create a flow and be sorta time efficient? Do you sometimes reuse old classes? Do you not prepare at all and just wing half the class right on the spot?

Right now I choose a certain theme or body part of focus, then I pick a few asanas that fit the theme, and then... I think of how I can string them together. Usually i take surya namaskar as a base for all my flows and work from there.

Somehow I spend 2 to 3 hours to prepare a 1-hour class. Im not getting paid for those preparation hours and its starting to bug me. Is it supposed to take this long? Bc then I will know its normal and I will accept it. But if not I'll gladly take any advice to make it quicker. However, im not at the point where I feel comfortable improvising on the spot (sometimes I do for small bits of the class, but certainly not a full flow)

Any insights are welcome!

"Absolutely! The Hanuman Chalisa is a shortened version of a book called Ramayana, which is really really really long.

It‚Äôs usually [sung as a song.](https://youtu.be/gCHDMUAIH1o?si=qz1jIceDEJTOaZRH)

There‚Äôs a [reggae version](https://youtu.be/rS-o--Bl0_A?si=NtGdeFWJN2BoPbU1) too!

In short, Hanuman is the devoted servant of Lord Ram. When Ram‚Äôs wife, Sita, is kidnapped by the demon king Ravana, Hanuman crosses an ocean, faces all kinds of challenges, and ultimately finds her in Lanka. Along the way, he grows in power, courage, and clarity‚Äînot for himself, but out of love and devotion. He becomes the embodiment of bhakti (devotion), shakti (power), and prana (life-force).

In yogic terms, Hanuman represents the breath (prana) and the heart‚Äôs devotion. His leap to Lanka is often seen symbolically as the leap of consciousness across the lower chakras to the higher centers.",comment_1,r/Yoga,Health,,https://i.redd.it/koe6b26zsr3f1.jpeg
"I lived in Taos, New Mexico, for 12 years. It has the only Hanuman Temple in the United States. I spent a lot of time there and have chanted the Chalisa hundreds of times. On Neem Karoli Baba‚Äôs Bhandara, we chanted it from 1:08am to 1:08pm.

"One slightly incorrect thing in your explanation: Hanuman doesn't grow or becomes anything in the Ramayana, he's already a nearly all-powerful being that easily overcome any obstacle, and doesn't change troughout the story. Rama is the protagonist and he learns and fails and gets better along the way. 

Rama is the personification of Atman, the soul which exists because it was once part of the Paramatman. 

Hanuman represents the mind, and the Ramayana as you said is the story of the soul journey, helped by the mind, to retrieve Sita, which stands for the Shakti, unbounded base energy, being held captive by Ravana, which represents the sense with his ten heads (they divided the five senses into passive and active) in Sri Lanka, the perineum where the shakti dwells 

It's a central part of the story that Hanuman could have easily retrieved Sita by himself, in no time, not breaking a single drop of sweat and easily overcoming Ravana and his army, *but he couldn't, because Sita refused to be saved by Hanuman and not by Rama*",comment_5,r/Yoga,Health,,https://i.redd.it/koe6b26zsr3f1.jpeg
"Sitting in an L shape Hi all, I've been practicing yoga regularly for about a year now and I can definitely feel how my body has gotten stronger and more flexible in a lot of ways which is amazing and what keeps me coming back for more. 
However when a class calls for sitting upright with your legs out in front of you, in an L shape, I really struggle! My hips especially get really tight and uncomfortable. I think it seems like it should be such a natural sitting position so I am using the wrong muscles? Even if I sit with my legs a bit bent I still struggle. 
I only do at home yoga atm because I am broke haha, following several different teachers on YouTube. 
I'm wondering what anyone would suggest to work on to make this pose easier? Strengthening certain muscles or just sitting a bit differently?",post,r/Yoga,Health,22.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/yoga/comments/1kyheg3/sitting_in_an_l_shape/
"If you're referring to staff pose, this is a deceptively difficult pose. It requires a mix of flexibility and strength to sit in comfortably. If you sit all day for a desk job, then you likely have shortened and weakened hip flexors, which will contribute to the challenge of the pose.

It's great that you're starting with your legs a bit bent here, I'd recommend bending them even further initially. You can slowly work to straightening them as you build strength and mobility. Working on leg lifts and dead bugs will help strengthen your core and hip flexors to help you sit more comfortably in an L shape. I also recommend working on your forward folds with a straight back to get into your hamstrings. You can even practice the legs up the wall stretch to passively stretch those hamstrings as well.",comment_1,r/Yoga,Health,,https://www.reddit.com/r/yoga/comments/1kyheg3/sitting_in_an_l_shape/

To stretch your hip flexors check out a yin yoga pose called Golden Gate.

"One month, went from unable to touch my toes to being able to touch my forehead to my knees. A few beginner questions too... (question at the end, after this long intro)

I started going to a yoga class at our local rec center between 1 and 3 times per week, typically twice per week, and in a month went from being unable to touch my toes to being able to curl my fingers under my feet and able to touch my forehead to my knees with my knees bent just enough to not lock them.  The change has been phenomenal, I feel so much better than I did before -- was starting to feel the stiffness of age catch up with me, which is what inspired me to start.

I feel like my standing/walking posture is notably better, my balance feels better (even though it wasn't really bad to begin with), and I feel stronger.

Thinking of finding another class that gives a bit more guidance on posture as the teachers where I'm going don't really correct your positions very often -- would prefer a bit more confidence that I'm doing the poses correctly and safely, especially as I get into deeper and deeper stretches.

At the same time I've started to be a bit more cautious of my serving sizes and have lost almost 15 pounds, which is also probably helping a lot.  I wasn't overweight, but I went from BMI of 23.7 (higher end of the normal range) down to 21.9  (6'4"" at 180 lbs), with a target BMI of about 21, so I still have a little way to go.

A few question though... 

How often should I take a break, and for how long?  I do feel like I might have overtrained recently as I feel more sore at the start than I did even after my first few lessons.

Sometimes when doing a straddle we are asked to move side to side into a sideways lunge (sorry, I'm not good with the names, hopefully that makes sense) and I feel an odd sensation on the inside of my straight knee (the edge that would touch the other knee if I were standing with my knees together) when leaning to one side or the other.  What could be contributing to that, and what can I do differently to avoid that feeling?",post,r/Yoga,Health,4.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/yoga/comments/1kybj7c/one_month_went_from_unable_to_touch_my_toes_to/
"Thank you.  The teachers have all asked for consent to make adjustments, and I've always affirmed that I'm OK with it, but they rarely walk around and do so -- that said, the positions can feel vulnerable and adjustments can mean touching in places we're not accustomed to, so I can see why it would be uncomfortable for some.

I was at a coffee shop a few days ago and there was a woman in front of me who left the the line to take some water glasses to her friends and when I offered her spot back to her we started talking and when we got to the topic of yoga she gave me a business card for a studio and said it was good for a free visit with a friend.

"Make sure to always keep a tiny bend in your knee. I've been doing it about a year and it's changed my life so I totally get this post. I didn't take any breaks, even when my knees hurt.  A couple things you can do to answer your questions. One is to simply ask the teacher for corrections, people are weird about being touched now a days so a lot of teachers shy away from the corrections. Also, let the teacher know about the knee thing as well. They are usually trained in modifications to accommodate knees.

See if you can find a local studio that offers many types of yoga, that is where I saw the most benefit, in taking 4-5 different styles and classes in the same studio to get the most well rounded workout possible.

"""Yoga chitta vritti nirodha"" & ADHD Quoting 1.2 Yogasutra here
""Yoga chitta vritti nirodha""
yoga is the stilling/ cessation of the distractions/changes of the mind

Please forgive me if I got this wrong but I guess I have captured the essence. 

Just discovered Yoga a while ago and I am loving it! 

Anyone here with diagnosed ADHD? Care to share your experiences before and after starting yoga? 

I am on 60 mg of Methyphenidate..I guess most of you being Americans, you have a brand name Ritalin. 


EDIT:
Thank you everyone! I had no intention of stopping my meds but just wondered about the one. So far based on what everyone else has said, the meds helped them get even better at the Asanas and with their Yoga journey. 

I especially struggle with morning wake up time impulses. My 20 mg of fast release actually helps me practice and that one hour makes me so calm, so happy...it carries over to most of the day!",post,r/Yoga,Health,11.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/yoga/comments/1kxob5j/yoga_chitta_vritti_nirodha_adhd/
"I find daily asana, breath-work and meditation to be the best medicine by far for my ADHD and c-PTSD. After 10 years of very regular psychiatric input, I was able to be discharged and it was all down to yoga.",comment_1,r/Yoga,Health,,https://www.reddit.com/r/yoga/comments/1kxob5j/yoga_chitta_vritti_nirodha_adhd/
"Yoga is not a substitute for proper medical treatment. And, there are benefits from ""just"" the physical practice. I don't want to diminish the value of hatha or vinyasa or whatever physical practice we maintain.¬†


Beyond this, there are other paths of yoga and there's no limit to how deep you can go. My practices include a lot of bhakti yoga (chanting and devotion). The yoga sutras describe rajas yoga, the royal or effortless path.¬†The eight limbs of yoga are practices which support our ability to:


* Be aware of how our actions affect other people (yamas)


* Maintain positive daily habits (niyamas)


* Regulate our energy levels (pranayama)


* Sit still (asana)


* Detach from external distractions (pratyahara)


* Detach from internal distractions (dharana)


* Stay on-task (dhyana)


* Feel fully present in the moment (samadhi)


For those of us with ADHD (myself included), the ability to do these things either sounds like a dream come true or maybe like some kind of torture ü§£ These are not things which we're automatically good at on our first try. It requires effort. But in time, we can improve in all these categories.


If you want to explore rajas yoga more deeply, I highly recommend working with a qualified neurodivergent-informed meditation teacher or a mindfulness-informed qualified mental health professional.


Good luck!",comment_2,r/Yoga,Health,,https://www.reddit.com/r/yoga/comments/1kxob5j/yoga_chitta_vritti_nirodha_adhd/
I've been practicing yoga regularly for about 2 and a half-ish years. Yoga will not ever replace my medication; it is a wonderful supportive practice for me.

balance issues after weight loss Has anyone ever experienced this? I have lost almost 50lbs in the last year and I'm struggling with basic balances that I used to excel in.

I‚Äôm experiencing the same thing. I‚Äôve 40 pounds since the beginning of the year and found that in my classes my balance is getting worse.

"How to develop real solidness/strength Forgive me if this sounds a little silly, it‚Äôs a bit difficult to explain with text. 

My teacher was talking about having a strong core (not core as in abs etc but more like root or trunk, as in a fundamental solidness to one‚Äôs body) and it struck me as something I‚Äôve felt I‚Äôm missing, although I was never able to verbalise it. 

I (31m) am reasonably strong for my weight (I lift regularly) and have okay core strength, but I am a little skinny and feel I don‚Äôt have that deep, strong solidness that a lot of people my age (esp men - I feel more feminine really, if you can forgive the gender stereotyping) would seem to have.

But I find my body actually feels quite flimsy lol, like a piece or string rather than a piece of wood. 

Does anyone have any insight maybe? Or has felt the same? What sort of practice would help me develop this inner strength/solidness?",post,r/Yoga,Health,12.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/yoga/comments/1kxk36z/how_to_develop_real_solidnessstrength/
"You need to target your iliopsoas. Poses like Parsvakonasana (side angle) but with both arms extended like you're holding a giant beach ball. Handstands are good too. Pilates is a great option.

You are correct in that your abs are definitely not your core, the 6-pack that everyone wants is a superficial group of muscles. For that you just have to starve yourself and do sit ups. For real, effortless core strength like an Olympic gymnast it's all in the iliopsoas.",comment_1,r/Yoga,Health,,https://www.reddit.com/r/yoga/comments/1kxk36z/how_to_develop_real_solidnessstrength/
"There are plenty of skinny female yogi's out there that are insanely strong and you you'd never know it by looking at them. When you get more familiar with your own practice, you will discover certain transitions and poses that require a lot of strength to pull off, you will also find that developing core strength goes far beyond just doing crunches. For me, it's just been yoga 2-3 times a week consistently, and I'm still making progress strength wise. I think yoga itself is good enough for core work but you could look at some of the Pilates stuff, sometimes it's incorporated with yoga classes and it does a good job of targeting the core.",comment_2,r/Yoga,Health,,https://www.reddit.com/r/yoga/comments/1kxk36z/how_to_develop_real_solidnessstrength/

"I listened to a really good podcast with Dr Stuart McGill who is a back and spine doctor, and he explained that since people are built differently the ways they train and build strength should be different too. He described it as some people are more like willow branches, lots of bend but not as much capacity to bear great loads of weight, and some are more like sturdy sticks, can hold weight but you can't bend them as much. Some people are more explosive and some people more suited to steady endurance.

There is no one size fits all when it comes to building strength according to him, but he did mention the Big 3 exercises for core stability which you can find easily on YouTube (McGill big 3). I really enjoyed the podcast because I feel like there is so much pressure to 'lift heavy' these days but ultimately that won't be for everyone. He spoke about the value of banded movements like walking uphill or monster walks with a band to strengthen hips and legs if you are someone who just isn't suited to doing heavy squats for instance.",comment_5,r/Yoga,Health,,https://www.reddit.com/r/yoga/comments/1kxk36z/how_to_develop_real_solidnessstrength/
