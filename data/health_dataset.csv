"I always wondered how people self harm? Do not read if still hurting yourself I know this is like a weird question. I used to harm myself as a teen and young adult, these times are (thankfully) over now.
But the question I kept asking myself back then remains. How do people hurt themselves? Like it's such an intimate moment in a twisted way, nobody every talks about it. 
Like i used to cut, and when i cut myself I couldn't just get a deep cut in one ""slicing"" motion, instead I cut the same cut over and over again until it was deep enough for. I always wondered if others did the same? Especially in for those super deep cuts, do people just get that in one go? 
I know this is super weird, but please feel free to share ""your technique"" of how you did it, I'm so morbidly curious.

And if you're still actively self harming, please find someone to help, there is a life after. It's a hard learning curve, but it is possible to not rely on it anymore.

i still want to kill mine from time to time though. i had a plan sometime in the past about how i could slit my mother's throat in her sleep. i think this distinguished me from that person as not only did i never attempt it but i was raised with enough guilt or fear in myself to only want to do that in private, which i sometimes mistake for the bittersweet oh yes i hate my family but i also love them, which in itself isn't untrue, but didn't apply to the situation. i also now think that since i haven't been abused as severely, or at least i don't remember it, i don't want to seem an overreacting person, even if i am one. that person I've known was really hurt and confused at me for not reacting shocked and even forgetting that they've told me about that occurrence because my brain just shortcutted it out of my memory in a day as a mechanism yet undiscovered.

"The way you feel is definitely something that can be managed. If you are going out with friends, have hobbies, and still feel this way, then you might talk to your therapist about being evaluated for things like depression/anxiety/adhd etc. If not, then talking to them about the way you feel can help you get down to the root cause of why, which can be difficult but will only help you in the long run. 

I understand feeling more alone around your parents. Mine were that way until I finally told them about the way I felt, and now I am able to have a more meaningful relationship with them. It might be worth a try!

I learned, acceptance, in an unusual way.
When I felt acceptance, in my body, 
acceptance... I didn't have to go anywhere...  That's what made me stay. I didnt have to do stuff anymore.

I could just sit here, and feel.. acceptance.
I did that a lot. Sitting. And smoking a cigarette.

Feeling acceptance.
 I sat here.
Feeling acceptance. I am a bit lazy, though.
But. Acceptance ... it felt good...

Acceptance feels better than numb
Acceptance feels better than dispair.
Acceptance. 
I think it's better than dispair.
Do you? Do you think acceptance is better?
Or do you think dispair is better?

I didn't have to get up and do anything, really.
I could just sit here. Feeling "" Acceptance ""
Still sitting. Smoking a cigarette and drinking some coffee.

""Acceptce"" and drinking coffee and smoking...
It just started to feel better...

"" The Emotional Guidance scale""
Acceptance is skyhigh on it.
Close to Joy. Enlightment.

So... yeah. 
Acceptance,
If we could just see that scale 

Enlightment, joy, its on 1.
But acceptance, where is it? it seems to be on 1, too. ( Well, for me it was)

1 is acceptance.
Self-doubt. Its on 22. Write acceptance and self doubt on that emotional scale you just printed out.

"Mental Health Profile ‚Äì Benjamin Rosten Benjamin Rosten is a Christian, pianist, and survivor whose life reflects resilience, vulnerability, and the pursuit of healing. Ben has lived with the complex effects of childhood trauma, near-death experiences, and persistent bullying, which contributed to challenges with self-esteem, social anxiety, bipolar depression, and addiction.

Diagnosed with Bipolar Depression, Ben has been under the care of Dr. Virgona since 2006, with treatment including medications, ECT, and therapeutic hospital stays at Ramsay Health Clinic Campbelltown. He currently receives monthly Paliperidone injections and finds his present medication mix to be effective, especially when paired with exercise and creative expression.

Ben is in recovery from alcohol misuse and a long-term gambling addiction (specifically pokie machines). These behaviors once served as coping mechanisms but are now addressed through therapy, including work with his psychologist Michael. Tools like rectangular box breathing and structured self-reflection have been essential in reducing the intensity of flashbacks, nightmares, and anxiety.

In 2018, Ben underwent gastric sleeve surgery after reaching 170kg. His recovery journey now includes daily cardio and strength training at the gym‚Äîpractices he experiences as deeply spiritual and healing. He currently weighs 100kg and aims to reach 80kg.

Music has always been central to Ben‚Äôs mental wellness. As a jazz pianist and improviser, he uses composition to process emotion, trauma, and spiritual insight. He finds strength in dreams and visualizations involving safe spaces (like his imagined sandcastle sanctuary), divine presence, and support from his late mother, Jesus, and other spiritual figures.

Ben‚Äôs story is not just one of survival, but of rebuilding‚Äîa daily commitment to health, faith, and growth. He brings honesty, creativity, and a compassionate perspective to every space he enters.",post,r/mentalhealth,Health,19.0,https://i.redd.it/i18yny4jvr2f1.jpeg

"How do you deal with quarter life crisis, loneliness and depression? I‚Äôm a 27 year old single male. I have a stable job at a hospital. I live with my parents but I pay my portion of the mortgage and bills, pay for my own car and health insurance, so no I‚Äôm not leeching off of them. I could move out, but in this economy it‚Äôs hard to live solo. My plan was to save up money and move out when I got into a relationship, but looks like it‚Äôs not working out. I tried dating apps, but to no avail. I only have a couple friends, but usually they‚Äôre busy with work or their SO. So most of the time I‚Äôm by myself. I feel so lonely all the time and as introverted as I am, I keep all these feelings to myself. I‚Äôm longing for a relationship which I‚Äôm not getting. I never really dated throughout my 20s. I‚Äôm really insecure of myself and nothing ever works out. I really, really liked this girl in college, whom I did ask out to go on a casual date but she ended up telling me that she didn‚Äôt feel the same way about me. I was devastated and I just gave up after that. I don‚Äôt like to believe in the saying ‚Äúthe right person will come to you eventually‚Äù.

You're doing incredibly well, and one day, a worthwhile woman will come along and see it, too.

In the meantime, I think you'd benefit from self-confidence training. You've already accomplished so much and should feel happy and immensely proud of yourself.

Find a therapist ASAP. Talk it out and find some accountability towards making small steps towards things you want. Find a life outside of work like group activities etc. Making friends allows you to network for dating opportunities. Even try taking dancing classes etc. The loneliness sucks I get it. 

Keep that goal of saving and moving out and when you do you all have that mental resiliency and attitude that‚Äôs going help you in the long run.

Spirituality might be something worth a try.

"NPD fucking sucks. I have NPD. And it isn't ""I think I'm better than you"", it's ""I struggle to experience certain things and I see the world differently than neurotypicals do"". 

I have the emotional maturity of a 2-4 year old child. My emotional growth was stunted at a young age, making it difficult to connect with other people and feel certain things. Thus, I exhibit behaviors, needs, and thoughts similarly to that of a young child (entitlement, selfishness, arrogance, ""tantrums"", etc)

My core is an insecure and traumatized child. I hide her behind a grandiose/ideal persona to cover up the shame and self-hatred I feel. I don't love myself. I love what I want to be.

I am unable to have mature relationships with other people. I automatically assume a ""provider"" role for the other person, feeling entitled to take things from them (mostly their attention). I rarely feel love for others, rather, I love what they can give me. I struggle with empathy and I feel very little, if no remorse at all when my actions end up hurting others. However, I've learned to be more considerate, more kind. I can offer my generosity to people who I think deserve it. I may find it hard to think of them, or to imagine myself in their shoes, but I have the cognitive ability to recognize that they're hurting. I have friends, and their empathy and understanding has allowed me to better myself as a person.

It pains me to see how simplified NPD has become in media. It feels less like a complex disorder and more like a quirky personality trait that goes along the lines of ""X did Y so that means they're Z"". The term ""narcissist"" is thrown around like a fucking volleyball to refer to anyone who shows any kind of arrogant or selfish behavior.",post,r/mentalhealth,Health,5.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1kumfqf/npd_fucking_sucks/

I‚Äôve been working for this since the summer before freshman year. Every single thought, and second has been spent watching content about getting into these schools, planning my schedule and finding resources to get into these. I don‚Äôt care about community college, or state school, I don‚Äôt care about anything other than getting into these schools and the stepping stones I need to make to achieve this goal. I have hired a college consultant from ivy brothers who is helping me write my personal statement and I do math team and robotics and coding club and have a summer internship, but there‚Äôs something missing. 

Awards. I have zero awards or accolades and I need them this year. I don‚Äôt mean national merit scholar or AP scholar or honor roll, I mean International Science Fair, world top 10 in my sport, app challenges, and published papers and qualifying for FRC worlds. 

I can do service and network and become a leader in every club but I can‚Äôt win. I‚Äôm not a winner, I have no natural talent to win any awards other than the awards that hold no prestigious meaning. I‚Äôve been doing math team for 2 years and the most I‚Äôve gotten is 2nd place at a local event, and I placed 2/4. I have to make up dumb honors like first from my club to compete at nationals but I went to nationals and I lost every single match. My average math team score is 22.3/50. I have never done a science fair and I‚Äôm trying to qualify for ISEF. I suck at essay writing and I‚Äôm doing the Scholastic Writing Awards. I have no natural talent so I have no direction or niche or spike to work towards. 

How can this be? I have a sibling who qualified for AIME and ranked top 5 in the Indian math Olympiad, and she placed top 10 at DECA internationals. A dad who went to a top 5 school in India who has such a passion for science and is insanely talented. How am I the youngest in this family? Why was I ever born? Why do I have nothing to show for all of the years of effort and advice and guidance given to me through them. I hear the pity in their voices when they talk abt me to relatives. Nothing to say. Nothing to brag about, nothing to be proud of. Nothing.

"What happened on the train still haunts me Hi everyone,

I had an extremely disturbing experience a few days ago that I can't stop thinking about. It happened during a train journey, and even though it's over, the anxiety hasn't left me. I've been feeling unsafe, on edge, and unable to sleep, so I thought I'd share it here, hoping it might help me process things or at least feel a little less alone.

I was traveling alone from Mumbai to Delhi in a 2nd AC coach. A man in my compartment, probably in his 40s, was visibly drunk, loud, swearing, and vomiting near dinner time. I already felt uneasy, but the next morning it got worse.

Around 5 AM, I was quietly working on my laptop when I saw him sitting across from me, staring directly at me and touching himself inappropriately. I froze. I didn't know how to respond. Later, as I packed my bags, I noticed him staring through a gap in his curtain, and eventually, he exposed himself and mimed an obscene gesture at me while whispering loudly to get my attention. It went on for minutes, and I was just‚Ä¶ paralyzed. I couldn't move. Couldn't speak.

I told my friend, and they filed a complaint on my behalf since I couldn't get through the helpline. Police met me at the station, and thankfully they were kind and helped me get out of the train safely. That man later confessed but when asked why he did it, he said:  
""She was wearing makeup. She was asking for it.""

That sentence keeps echoing in my head. I was wearing a cardigan, yoga pants, and crocs. I just touched up my face a bit in the morning. That's it. I don't know why we live in a world where the way a woman dresses or looks is still used to excuse this kind of behavior.

I filed the complaint. I did what I could. But now I'm left with this overwhelming anxiety. The fear hasn't left. I keep playing it all over again in my mind, what he did, how I felt frozen, what could have happened if things went differently. I feel on edge, like I'm not even safe in places that should be routine or harmless.

And I can't even talk to my parents about it.

Today, I was sitting next to my mom, not doing anything, just quiet, and she suddenly asked me, ""You have something to tell me, right?"" I had tears in my eyes. But I couldn't say a word. I just sat there. I didn't want to worry her, or see the pain in her eyes, or feel like I'd broken some unspoken trust. I know she would support me. But I still couldn't do it.

So here I am, sharing this with strangers online, because I don't know where else to put these feelings. I just want to vent. I want to feel understood. I want the thoughts to slow down. I want the anxiety to fade.

If anyone has advice on coping with trauma like this, or even just kind words, I'd really appreciate it. I feel like I'm carrying this alone, and it's heavier than I expected.

"How old are you that you think they would find out? Usually therapists only talk to someone else about what you say in therapy if you say you want to kill someone or you‚Äôre self harming. So they will not know about it. 

About the talking about it. I totally understand that it must be difficult to talk about it, because oftentimes we shut those parts of us down and try to hide it. Like we‚Äôre some kind of robot.

Judging from what you said if you hadn't done what you just did your mental health could have gotten a whole lot worse. There is also nothing wrong with you for relapsing. The best course of action for you right now is probably just trying to reduce stress or seek professional help or just talk to a friend. Don't be too harsh on yourself. I hope you can get past this wall. I wish you the best of luck.,comment_1,r/mentalhealth,Health,,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1kus2io/i_just_left_my_job_ive_had_for_a_month/

Symptomsnof mania??? What is mania??,post,r/mentalhealth,Health,3.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1kupncz/symptomsnof_mania/
"Mania is a mental and emotional state where a person feels extremely energized, excited, or irritable, often in ways that are out of proportion to what's going on around them and  lasting at least one week, and not explained by substance use or another condition. It‚Äôs not just ""being in a good mood"" or ""having lots of energy"" ‚Äî it‚Äôs a profound shift in how someone thinks, feels, and behaves. Mania is very common in disorders like bipolar disorder or schizoaffective disorder (more commonly mania and psychosis comorbidly).

Mania causes a lot of symptoms. Below is a list; the first two are **needed** for it to be considered a manic episode:

\- **Mood disturbances:** Manic episodes **must** cause a very high or euphoric mood, high confidence levels but can also cause irritability.

\- **Increased activity and/or energy levels:** Manic episodes **must** cause high levels of energy or increased activity

Other possible symptoms: 

\- **Psychomotor agitation (**restlessness and irritability)

\- **Higher self-esteem and/or confidence**

\- **Difficulty sleeping or sleeping less**

**- Hallucinations**

**- Racing thoughts**

**- more easily distracted**

**- wanting goal-oriented activities more frequently** 

**- More talkative** 

**- Difficulties or impairment in social, occupational, or financial functioning**.

**- Delusions**

**- psychosis**

Mania is a serious mental state, and often requires hospitalization. **If you believe that you have mania I highly recommend going to see a mental health professional and possibly getting treatment.** I hope this helps!",comment_1,r/mentalhealth,Health,,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1kupncz/symptomsnof_mania/

"My sister creates false memories she 100% believes to be true, anyone else ever meet anyone who does this? I just want to know if anyone else has experienced this. My sister (35f) has autism and ADHD. Now idk if this has anything to do with autism or adhd (i think it‚Äôs unlikely) but my younger sister has done this since she was a child. I remember being little and having a serious argument with her about her recalling a trip to Disney World that had never occurred. 

Now that she‚Äôs older idk if it‚Äôs just become more obvious or if it‚Äôs simply increasing in frequency. She‚Äôs been saying outlandish things about our parents that I know to be untrue but I‚Äôve not challenged her on them because I don‚Äôt want to fight. We were adopted young by an older couple so they were elderly most of our lives. 

She has been claiming our adopted father had trained her to be a nazi when she was a teen. Which is crazy. Dad had emphysema and heart issues, he couldn‚Äôt train her to do anything even if he wanted to and he wasn‚Äôt a Nazi. The only thing I can think of that would be related is that they both had an interest in WW2. 

Now she‚Äôs claiming our mother was severely emotionally abusive to her when in fact she was the beloved baby of the family. She was mom‚Äôs little sidekick. She always had to be next to her. Like we had assigned seats at the dinner table because I wasn‚Äôt allowed to sit next to mom. She was very possessive of mom. So idk where this is coming from. 

My sister has a husband that refuses to acknowledge her audhd diagnosis and now she‚Äôs convinced she never had it. I think maybe blaming mom became a necessity to explain her neurospicy behavior to her husband. Has anyone else had any issue with someone that actually believes the crazy things they say happened to them when the opposite can be proven true??",post,r/mentalhealth,Health,5.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1kum6v9/my_sister_creates_false_memories_she_100_believes/

"Myself!

It's not on that extreme, but maybe it's because your sister is older than me, but anyway I have memories that just aren't true and things I completly forget even if I'm being told it happens. like you forget something, but if someone explains what happenned or tells you about it you'd go like ""oh yea I remember this"".. Well I don't. I just have a VERY specific memory which is very annoying and burdensome.

I have a very precise memory of me in middleschool, leaving the house with my family dog for a walk in the week end when my grandmother (she lives 12hrs away from my family so she's there on vacation) comes by our house with her dog, tiny dog My family's dog is a big one, the kind that pulls you when you go on a walk  
I remember tiny dog trying to bite me and my dog just casually trying to bite it to death cause it hurt me, I remember where it happened, how, when, everything. But talking to my dad about it years later, he told me this dog never made it to this house. I was so confused.

Another time I was hanging out with a friend to our highschool's city. They live in that city and I walk with them to their house a few times so I know where it is. That one time, I text them ""i'm outside your house, i'm waiting"" and they said they'll be there shortly, then texted me ""where are you, you're not near my house at all"". So i answered where i was and they told me their house wasn't here at all. And this time, i had the single memory of a specific street we turned to which was at the opposite of where i was. But that's all. To the opposite, i had a LOT of little memories of her at this window in the appartment i was waiting at, and left very confused as to how i messed this up

this also happenned a number of times in class where i would remember things or forget others that was very important but either fake or just don't have the info.

I wanna say that I am not living this well. I have others things that does not pair well with this memory thing, but biggest issue i have with it is that i'm just so lost, every single minute. I never know if a memory i have is true until i mention it and someone confirms it. I never know if i did something, made it up, or didn't do it. And i just don't know what is true or not. I have excessive doubts too which makes me feel like a giant emotional fraud and it's not pleasant, everytime i talk about myself i don't know what true or not.

"Living with Bipolar and Weight Struggles: My Journey Toward Health and Self-Compassion Hi Reddit,

I‚Äôm Benjamin Rosten. I‚Äôm 48 now, and I wanted to open up about something deeply personal that I know a lot of others struggle with too: living with bipolar disorder and the complicated relationship with weight, body image, and self-worth that often comes with it.

I was diagnosed with bipolar depression back in 2006. Since then, it‚Äôs been a long road involving medications, hospital stays, ECT, therapy, and learning to cope with the cycles of highs and crushing lows. One of the hardest parts has been the side effects of medications‚Äîespecially the weight gain.

At my heaviest, I was 170kg (375 lbs). I felt trapped in a body that didn‚Äôt match who I wanted to be. In 2018, I made the decision to have gastric sleeve surgery. It wasn‚Äôt an easy choice, but it gave me a new start. I‚Äôve lost 70kg since then, and I‚Äôm now hovering around 100kg (220 lbs), aiming for 80kg. But let me be real: it hasn‚Äôt been a straight line, and the emotional weight sometimes feels heavier than the physical.

The gym has become a sanctuary for me. It‚Äôs not just about the treadmill or weights‚Äîit‚Äôs a space where I reconnect with myself, sweat out the pain, and feel in control. I also play piano, and since my surgery and ongoing recovery, I‚Äôve felt a freedom in my improvisations that reflects the emotional weight I‚Äôve shed.

There‚Äôs still stigma around mental illness, especially when it intersects with things like obesity or addiction. I used to rely on alcohol and pokie machines to escape, but I‚Äôve come a long way in recovery. I‚Äôm still learning to be gentle with myself, to accept that health is a journey, not a destination.

If you‚Äôre out there navigating something similar‚Äîwhether it‚Äôs bipolar, weight struggles, addiction, or all of the above‚Äîyou‚Äôre not alone. I see you.

I‚Äôd love to hear your stories too. How do you manage the mental and physical aspects of healing? What‚Äôs helped you stay on the path?

Thanks for listening.

"I don‚Äôt have a escape from all my responsibilities anymore When I was a kid, I had a pretty turbulent upbringing. Games, especially World of Warcraft were my escape. They weren‚Äôt just entertainment. They were my safe haven. I could log in, forget about responsibilities, and just be in another world where nothing demanded anything of me.

Now I‚Äôm an adult. I‚Äôve been through several education programs I ended up dropping out of. I‚Äôm working full time and carry responsibilities every day. When I finally get home and try to play a game, even the ones I used to love, it just doesn‚Äôt feel the same. I log in, and within 10 minutes, I log out again. It all feels dull or pointless. I overthink everything and can‚Äôt immerse myself anymore. It‚Äôs really frustrating.

The digital world was always my go-to escape, the only place that wasn‚Äôt stressful. But now even that doesn‚Äôt feel like an escape. I keep wondering: why can‚Äôt I feel what I used to? Why can‚Äôt I enjoy it again? Why do I feel so disconnected all the time?

I feel like I‚Äôve lost the one place where I could just be myself without pressure. People say ‚Äúfind a new outlet‚Äù or ‚Äúgo outside‚Äù or ‚Äútry new things‚Äù, but honestly, nothing else ever gave me that same feeling of peace. I don‚Äôt even know what I‚Äôm looking for anymore.

"What the fuck am i supposed to do Slight waning this is going to be VERY vent-y, but i really do want advice. I dont know what to do anymore

I graduated college a little over a year ago and my life has been absolute shit ever since. I dont want to work, i CANT work. I have literally no desire at all to have a job and i feel so goddamn awful about it. Im chronically ill (fibro) and am just so fucked up mentally.

Ive gone to therapy for years now and have taken meds for years and i dont understand why im not better or farther along. I just sleep and play video games/draw and waste away every week until i can finally go to therapy again, only once a week because we cant afford to go more even though i think i desperately need it. 

My parents are so pissed at me and they pay for nearly everything. Im drowning in debt from college and im too stupid and spoiled and tired to just suck it up and get a job. What the fuck am i supposed to do other than just rot away for my whole life? I cant live by myself or take care of myself without help.

Thats not even starting about the state of the us right now. Whats the point of anything? Im just supposed to waste literally all of my life doing something i fucking hate, trapped in a stupid job and not having the energy for anything else? And then what? After 50 years of soul crushing labor i retire when my body is so fucked up and in pain that i cant even do half of the stuff i want? And then we just die? What a miserable existence. 

I genuinely dont know what to do or where im going or if i should just give up and become a basement dwelling, video game playing, useless daughter that lives with her parents because i literally dont think i can handle anything. Every job ive had in the past i very quickly developed such a bad seething hatred and terrible dread of it that i had to quit. 

What is a person like me supposed to even do? My happiness is like a shattered glass vase kept together with cheap shitty glue and even one wrong gust of breath just fucks it up beyond repair. One thing goes wrong and i just collapse. I feel like such a sensitive spoiled brat when i say all of this and it just makes it worse.

It is hard being alone. It can get dark, if you find something to occupy your mind it may help, like gaming or binge watching a series, are you much of an out going person? Or more in doors?

Over time you will naturally become less lonely, so don't worry too much, maybe seeing your family could help? Or doing something with them like fishing or just something to remember you know? 

Something to pass the time or occupy your mind is what I'm getting at really, maybe find new hobbies? Maybe getting lessons for an instrument is a good idea? Or going to a gym? That way your kindof killing 3 or 4 birds with one stone, you are learning something new, socializing, getting a new skill and so on.

It can also be infuriating to watch other people give you false platitudes when they have no idea what you're dealing with and how it's personally affecting you.

"Don't want to get better (kinda vent) Fyi: burner accnt 

So as the title says, I just don't wanna get better. I'm on a horrible roller coaster of 20 on 30 off days of being happy then depression constantly. And the happiness isn't truly happiness it's just more a slightly above the other one/mediocre mood. 

So my thought is why try? I've struggled with self harm and parents know but why should I even try to get better anymore? Only thing keeping me from self harming again is the summer and lack of first aid and there is going to be a point where I gotta relapse like last time. 

I also just don't feel like getting better, I wanna test the limits of that bottom. I wanna try drugs, drink, smoke, do whatever and just fall deeper. Even now in my higher mood it's like this. 

I don't have anyone to talk to about this anymore in my life, don't wanna tell adults ofc and I have no close friends. Things aren't easy to get over without socialization a bit at least. Another reason I wanna get worse cuz nobody is close enough to me to care besides my parents but it doesn't rlly matter to me cuz I can hide it. 

I also wanna feel terrible too, like lose blood to dangerous levels, get no sleep, starve, just feel all of that. Maybe just to feel something idfk.

I'm gonna die anyway."" or ""Why bother even enjoying life? When I'm going to die one day."" At last, I couldn't handle it anymore, so I took it upon myself to finally accept it.

Last week, I watched Hospice videos, Terminally ill patients, and what old people generally think about death. I even watched funeral videos. In conclusion, after hundreds of videos, I basically accepted death, better yet, I felt happy! 

I thought accepting death was enough to live my life normally again, but I realised I just can't stop thinking about it, I had recurring thoughts about me or my family members dying, how much I would cry after my parents died, and about my last days on earth, My mind is full of death and it's driving me crazy, I just want to stop thinking about it and think normally but it's all I can think about, It has become a huge problem because I can't focus on anything else.

What do I do? I'm scared this is going to be my mindset forever.. I just want to think normally, like what's for dinner tonight? Or I should study for this test! not constant death thoughts.

"After Back Pain and Burnout, Nord Pilates Helped Me Feel Capable Again I work in tech and sit for 10‚Äì12 hours a day. Last year, I started getting really bad lower back pain. Not enough to need a doctor, but enough to affect sleep, mood, and even how I walked. I tried stretching videos, but nothing stuck ‚Äî and lifting at the gym felt risky.



That‚Äôs when I tried Nord Pilates ‚Äî mostly out of curiosity, partly out of desperation.



The first few sessions were humbling. Even the gentle movements activated muscles I didn‚Äôt know I had. But they were manageable. And more importantly: they worked.



What changed after 4 weeks:



My back pain reduced significantly (especially after their ‚Äúcore + posture‚Äù series)



I started sitting and standing differently ‚Äî taller, more balanced



I felt more in control of my body again



I actually craved the sessions ‚Äî they became my reset between work and evening



There‚Äôs also a mental calmness that comes from their audio sessions. No pressure, no push ‚Äî just movement and breath. I‚Äôve since tried their Cortisol Detox and Menopause guides (for my wife too) ‚Äî and they‚Äôve both made a noticeable impact.



We don‚Äôt talk enough about fitness being gentle. This was the first time I felt like movement healed me rather than punished me.

I have been finding it difficult to walk or sit down at various sporadic parts of the day, with no clear pattern as to when the issue will strike. I am a veteran with a long list of health conditions as well as anxiety disorders and ptsd but something is different here and im sure the issue is not entirely in my head although i imagine stress could be an aggravating factor. The only thing that is clear when the condition strikes is the emergence of a large and firm poonis from between my cheeks and legs which makes walking and sitting normally suddenly very complicated and difficult. I cant turn to family or friends for support due to the nature of the issue and doctors wont take me seriously, so here I am.

"Low carb liquid diet, for the rest of my life. Need help figuring it out! So I have a very rare and serious health condition that affects my bowel, and means I have to keep 'fermenting foods' to a minimum. That's mostly carbs, like grain, but also some veg, legumes, etc.

I've been referred to a dietitian but unfortunately as it's on the NHS that will take a few weeks to get; maybe a couple of months even. I have been told to switch to a liquid diet in the mean time and have been blending my food, using a food processor.

From looking into it a bit, I think that I am looking for something akin to a keto diet - I think.

But the aim is to gain weight, or at least to have a diet that would make a normal person gain weight. Realistically I wont be eating all of the food and I will likely vomit some up and not absorb a lot of it, so I need to aim for 3000+ calories per day.

Please could somebody help me find a diet that fits these requirements? Honestly, my life could depend on it (if I got especially unlucky).

I will have to be on this diet permanently so I need to try and get all my nutrients with these strict limitations. It's a pain in the butt and so far I've been failing and my bowel is getting angry :c So i'm pretty desperate for some help, can anybody give me some recipes for meals that fit these requirements?

"Thank you! Yes, I'll speak to my dietician about this. I actually suspect they'll be moving towards an elemental diet, once I have appointments with them. Somebody else mentioned the same thing and I think this is what my gastroenterologist is discussing in his communications with the dietician. Although I don't have a copy of that, I was just sat with him when he sent the referral. 

If it helps me, I don't care if it tastes bad. Honestly I don't enjoy food anymore anyway, I think the fact it makes me feel nauseous and my bowel doesn't accept it properly means that I have zero appetite and things taste kind of bad for me. 

I appreciate your help, I will definitely go in this direction and speak to my dietician about this. I'm hesitant to switch now before speaking to them, but maybe it would be best to try it now (since my bowel is pretty angry, atm) I would guess that this liquid food is much better for my bowel than what I'm eating at the moment.",comment_1,r/Dietandhealth,Health,,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dietandhealth/comments/1km31gl/low_carb_liquid_diet_for_the_rest_of_my_life_need/

If your weight is holding steady you can drop a hundred calories from your daily intake and see if your weight starts to go down after a week of eating that reduced amount. If it doesn‚Äôt drop try dropping another 100 calories.

Yes you will certainly feel better if you eat healthier at that same calorie range. If you‚Äôre mainly eating junk food you‚Äôre likely not getting enough protein which could really affect your energy. Staying away from sugar can also help. I would recommend sticking to things such as rice and other grains for your carbs. Sugar provides a quick jolt and crash while healthy carbs give you a more consistent source of energy. If you mix in some weightlifting and cardio you can raise your metabolism which can allow you to stay skinny but eat more. Even just going on a 30 min walk outside every day will make a huge difference I promise. I‚Äôve been weightlifting for years and it is insane the impact it has on your metabolism. It has given me much more leeway with my diet. I would also recommend going to the doctor to get a blood test to see if you have any deficiencies that you could take care of with vitamins. Vitamin D is a likely one that you could be deficient in that would affect your energy. Also keep in mind that eating healthy is eating balanced.

"No not really, not to the extent you are.  Your body is telling you this.  Yes eating junk makes you feel like junk,  but this is just as much a result of your lack of calories and healthy body fat as your lack of nutrients. Women need a certain amount of body fat (higher than men) to have a healthy hormonal balance, and humans need a certain level of body fat to properly process certain nutrients. 

Healthy foods or not, if you add exercise to your current calorie intake you're also going to exacerbated the issue. More movement means higher calorie needs, if you're unable to function on what you're eating while sedentary you're not going to be able to do it with more movement. 

You need to eat healthy foods and stop tracking calories. Get help for your ED if you can before you do potentially permanent damage to your body",comment_3,r/Dietandhealth,Health,,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dietandhealth/comments/1kldd54/is_it_possible_to_stay_underweight_and_still_be/

Anyway we both now do some exercise but nothing crazy, eat mostly meat, fish, eggs and dairy and have no issues whatsoever with being under or over weight, it's life changingly good!

"Other possibly reasons for fatigue around meals..

Insulin Sensitivity Issues:

Even if your blood tests are normal, you could have mild insulin resistance, causing post-meal fatigue. A glucose tolerance test (or wearing a continuous glucose monitor for a few weeks) could help identify this.

Autonomic Nervous System Imbalance:

Excessive bulking and cutting can sometimes dysregulate your autonomic nervous system, leading to poor transitions between sympathetic (active) and parasympathetic (rest) states, causing you to feel drained after eating.

Postprandial Hypotension:

This is a drop in blood pressure after eating, which can make you feel tired or lightheaded. It‚Äôs more common than people realize, especially in tall or athletic individuals.

Food Sensitivities or Intolerances:

Sometimes, fatigue after meals is a subtle sign of food sensitivities (e.g., gluten, dairy, or specific grains). An elimination diet might help identify triggers.

Mitochondrial Fatigue:

If your cells aren‚Äôt efficiently converting food to energy (ATP), you can feel wiped out even after eating plenty. This can sometimes be linked to chronic overtraining or nutrient deficiencies like CoQ10.

Hormonal Imbalances:

Chronic dieting and heavy training can sometimes throw off thyroid function or cortisol rhythms. Did your doctor check thyroid markers like TSH, T3, and T4?

Blood Flow Diversion (Splanchnic Circulation):

After eating, blood is redirected to your digestive system, which can cause fatigue if your body isn‚Äôt handling that transition smoothly.",comment_3,r/Dietandhealth,Health,,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dietandhealth/comments/1kl5v4c/diet_issues/

- After 4 days of water fasting I learned about that Peter Attia changed his views on water only fasting because of Muscle Atrophy
- I decided to do 16:8 instead consistently as long as I can
- After the 4 days water fasting I lost 6 kgs(82kg last I check then 76 on the 4th day), then when I get back on eating, my weight is consistent on 78.
- Last week, I started my training on 5k run with a Garmin Coach(Greg)

Some of the best weight loss experiences i have come across are where the weight loss was so slow, they didn't even really realize the weight was coming off.

One person said they cleaned up their diet, walked daily, and 5 years later . . . much less weight.  Ten years later, still at that lighter weight.

"Ok so here are some options for all 3 meals that contain suitable amounts of each food group, you can find recipes online and portion to your liking. I‚Äôm a very big fan of getting 10g fibre per meal and 20g protein. 

- Chia pudding or overnight oats are great for meal prep, or you can combine the two for a balanced fibre/carb ratio. Adding greek yoghurt or protein powder to these can bulk them up with protein, and you can add fruit and honey for flavour (or whatever sweet options you like!). cereals and granolas shouldn‚Äôt be your overall go-to because a lot of the time they‚Äôre just sugary with little fibre in. Toast is good if coupled with beans , eggs , peanut butter - Just make sure to add more fibre to the meal (fruits high in fibre are raspberries and blackberries) 

- For lunch I‚Äôd say if you like salad , then salad is a great option for you. Leafy greens are great but you‚Äôre better of filling the salad with beans and legumes more than just vegetables - Maybe type in ‚Äúdense bean salad‚Äù on google and it‚Äôll have a great recipe that‚Äôll last you about 4/5 days. Sandwiches are great too with a protein filling , and you can keep your fibre on the side (some breads contain lots of fibre if you wanna have a look at those). 

- Dinner you can basically have anything as long as it fits your 10g fibre and 20g protein. Sometimes if you‚Äôve missed certain nutrients during the day, it‚Äôs easy to make them up during this meal. If you‚Äôre ever struggling to come up with a good dinner option , salmon with rice and broccoli is always a staple in my house! I cook the salmon in honey and chilli , fry some onion in the rice with some peas , and roast the broccoli next to the salmon.

Could the anti-inflammatory diet help my colitis? Lately I have been considering dieting to improve my health and lose weight. After doing some research I discovered the anti-inflammatory diet and I am wondering if it will help my colitis or if this diet was created for another purpose. Any advice or recommendations regarding this?

"I am not sure what the anti-inflammatory diet means, but I'm also not sure if all colitis is the same, so what works for one person may not work for another. 

I wouldn't say that I follow any particular diet myself,  but one thing I've found useful is logging my foods once in a while to see if I'm doing okay with getting vitamins and minerals.  The site I use most often is [myfooddata.com](http://myfooddata.com) (which is free)  and it also gives you an ""inflammation score"", for which lower is supposed to be better.

"An app that helps you eating healthier Hey everyone, I just wanted to share something I've been working on for a while.¬†

I've built an iOS app called \*MealSnap\* that helps you log your meals and keep track of your calories, but I‚Äôve really tried to make it as simple and quick as possible. I‚Äôve gone through so many versions of it, and this latest versions (since v4) is built around a nutrition model I‚Äôve trained myself, called NutriAI.

The goal for me wasn‚Äôt to add a bunch of fancy features, but just to make something that gets the job done without wasting time. You log your meals (including drinks), it counts your calories automatically, and if your diet is looking a bit off or you're going over your daily limit, it gives you suggestions.. I've been using it myself daily and keep tweaking it, but I‚Äôd love to get feedback from others, especially people here who care about nutrition and healthy eating.

Now, would this kind of app help you stay on track with your diet? I know calorie tracking apps can sometimes be over-complicated or annoying to use.

If anyone wants to check it out, it's on the App Store here: [https://apps.apple.com/app/mealsnap-ai-food-log-tracker/id6475162854](https://apps.apple.com/app/mealsnap-ai-food-log-tracker/id6475162854) ¬†

I weighted 49 kg before and today I weight 55kg or a little more. Not too much but I'm content with the results especially because I did not work out at all to get here. Most of the weight went to my legs and ass which is a good thing but obviously some of it made its way to my belly and what worries me the most: the face. I know I have to exercise now to keep my ass and slim my waist a little, but I just wondered what kind of foods I should be eating and what kind of diet I should do to help keep my ass and legs, slim my waist, slim my face, and also keep my stomach and face from bloating so much.

Why does rapeseed/canola oil make me smell bad? Why does rapeseed/canola oil make me smell bad?,post,r/Dietandhealth,Health,3.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dietandhealth/comments/1jrhl94/why_does_rapeseedcanola_oil_make_me_smell_bad/

"I have never heard of this, but this is an ai-generated answer:

  
""Rapeseed/canola oil can sometimes cause a bad smell due to certain compounds called glucosinolates that are present in the seeds. These compounds can break down and release volatile sulfur compounds, leading to a pungent, sulfurous odor, according to Taylor & Francis Online. Additionally, some individuals may experience an allergic or intolerant reaction to rapeseed oil, which could manifest as bodily odors, according to Check My Body Health UK. 

Here's a more detailed explanation:

Glucosinolates and Sulfur Compounds:

Rapeseed belongs to the Brassica family, which also includes cabbage, broccoli, and other vegetables with strong sulfur-containing odors. Glucosinolates in rapeseed can break down into various compounds, including isothiocyanates and other sulfur compounds. These compounds contribute to the pungent, sulfurous aroma often associated with rapeseed oil. 

Allergies and Intolerances:

Some people may experience an allergic or intolerant reaction to rapeseed oil, which could lead to various symptoms, including changes in body odor. If you suspect you have an allergy or intolerance, it's important to seek medical advice and get tested, according to Check My Body Health UK. 

Processing and Quality:

The smell of rapeseed oil can also vary depending on how it's processed. Refined rapeseed oil is typically less likely to have a strong smell than cold-pressed or unrefined varieties, according to a Reddit post.""

Plenty of fiber, protein and water, and some fats. Typical main meal: cucumber slices with pepper and salt, slice of chedder cheese, bell pepper half, tin of tuna or mackerel in sunflower oil, black unsweetened tea.

I'm utterly hopeless at fasting, so trying pigging out on stuff with zero sugar, and occasional complex carbs like kidney beans.

So, does it ruin my progress to have a slice of bread at the end of the day? Am I just programming myself to put on fat when I *do* get some carbs? Or do I need *some* of them?",post,r/Dietandhealth,Health,2.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dietandhealth/comments/1jmxrzh/lowcarb_or_no_carb/

"What is your height and sex? 

I personally think carbs are fine as long as they are complex carbs. So avoid simple sugars but all vegetables and whole grains are fine. You are going to hear from keto folks that all carbs are bad. I think any diet that completely cuts out a food group is not a good idea and you have to think of the long term question ‚Äúcan you eat this way forever?‚Äù Because if you lose weight eating some specific restrictive way and you can‚Äôt sustain it you‚Äôll end up gaining all the weight back. 

Learn to eat in a way that is healthy and sustainable and keeps you in a MODERATE calorie deficit.

"I agree with the person above. As someone who has studied this and also watched people that were obese slim down, it is important to count your calorie intake for at least 2 weeks to have a basic understanding of what your body needs and where you may be over indulging.  For example, beans are typically high in calories due to carbs and fat, but they are a healthy food, however if you are eating too much, you may be working against yourself.

The point of using free apps like Cronometer are that you can see what valuable nutrients those foods give you. It isn‚Äôt just about the calories. You need balance of proteins, carbs, and fats. Also learning to understand Macros may be worth investing in.

Learn a skill for life, not for a short term. Understand what your body needs. Eating not enough calories can be just as damaging as eating too many. You should slowly taper off calories by 50-100 every 2-4 weeks until you get to the target calorie limit you need to be at and this will help you from bingeing . Allow yourself some flexibility and don‚Äôt cut everything out. Indulge occasionally in moderation. Allow yourself that slice of cake.

"Hi it is good fo hear you wanna lose weight and workout sadly there is no shortcut for losing weight there are supplements like green tea and cafeine wich help losing weight but both give very limiting effects were as cafeine can give you energy to do cardio or weight lifting thus increasing your activity making you burn more calories so cafeine can be worth it but also don't take tomuch.

 And like i said there is truly no shortcut for losing weight when i say this i mean if you are gona fast for a long period of time while exercising you might lose alot of weight but the weight will not only be fat the end goal should be body fat,
 it might be a good idea to have it tested and make an appointment to test it again so you have something to strive you should also not do anything expensive you can buy skinfold caliper yourself that is not to expensive and have someone you know do it.

This would give you about a week between working the same muscle again which will hopefully give it some time to recover.

"Day 1 I did it! After a few weeks of saying I wanted to go to our apartment gym, tonight I finally decided to go. Dragged my partner along with me, and he showed me how to use the machines. Half a mile walking there and back, 40 lat pull-downs, 10 rows and like two turny arm pull things before my shoulder started making a bad grinding feeling. It's not much, but I haven't really worked out since I was a kid so I'm proud. 

Tomorrow I'll do some walking in the pool, which is easier on my bad knee. Right now we agreed to twice a week in the gym, ramping up over two months or so. I'm thinking 3 days of pool, 2 of gym, 2 resting for the next week. 

It's not really about weight for me, even though I am certainly fat. Right now I'm at 260 after losing 50 from what we think was an ulcer making me super sick. Mostly I want stronger muscles so I'm in less pain. If that means losing weight it's fine, but I love my body in any shape it takes. 

I would like to have a stronger lower back especially, since my lower back has hurt since puberty hit. I tried looking up videos, but a lot of what I saw seems rough on the knees. My right knee had a mystery injury from a fall a few years ago, and it made me use a walker for a year before one day it  popped crazy loud and I could walk again. My doctor still doesn't understand exactly what was wrong. Even when it looked like a grapefruit, imaging didn't show anything torn or burst. I can walk now and even do single flights of stairs, but I'm worried about making it stop working again. 

Anyway, sorry for the ramble, but I'd love some advice. Back stuff would help a lot, but I also think a bit more muscle everywhere could help. I'm not strong (yet!) but I am determined. Are there any good starter exercises I should be focusing on? We have a few weight machines for arms (rowing, pulldowns, and one that adjusts to high, medium, and low for different arm pull things) and one for legs (you sit in it and then lift with your lower legs). Other machines will have to wait until we figure out transport to our nearest planet fitness.

"Chest issues Hello there, some context: I am 18 years old and have been going to the gym, losing weight, etc for about 8ish months now.

I have been doing PR‚Äôs for bench press since starting and flew up in weight, I easily hit 2 pr‚Äôs in one session one night, 87.5 -> 90 & 90 -> 92.5.

I attempted 95 as I had a huge ego, going up by 5kg in one session. During the lift on the way down, my chest sort of gave out and I thought nothing of it. Since then; I have been weaker than ever in my chest, benching wise, I can barely lift 85kg and I can physically feel every chest-related movement is weaker. 

Any tips/advice on what I can do to improve again and or any insight on what might‚Äôve happened? Thanks.",post,r/Workingout,Health,3.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Workingout/comments/1kqonb6/chest_issues/

If you don't think it's injury related, I would certainly just back off the heavy work for a while, probably at least a month. Aside from the heavy work, even on your higher rep sets I would leave a lot of reps on the table, say 5-6 RIR and work up from there. Basically, just not training your chest super hard for a while and build your base up again.

Bro splits are really outdated and basically no one should be doing them. They only make sense if you‚Äôre training every day. You have no excuse to not be hitting legs.

"Since you‚Äôve taken my suggestion imma write out a sample format for you.

Upper
Horizontal Pull
Horizontal push
Vertical pull
Vertical Push

Any movement for side delts

Legs/ arms
Squat
Hinge
(I would also try to do a lunge or any single leg squat if you have it in you) 
Quad isolation
Hamstring isolation
Calves

Pull day (back and biceps)
Vertical Pull
Horizontal Pull
Some sort of pullover
(Consider adding rear delt work after this if you need it)

1 movement for the short head of the biceps (preacher curls, standing curls)
1 movement for the long head (incline curls, Bayesian curls)
1 movement for the forearms/ brachialis (hammer curls or reverse curls are good options)

Push Day
Horizontal Push
Horizontal Pull
Chest fly
Side felt work

1 push down contraction focused movement for the triceps (you could start the workout with these)
1 overhead tricep extensions movement (overhead dumbbell or cable extension)

Now in your post you talked about doing some more arms on leg day and I think that‚Äôs a good idea, but you could also put them on your upper body day too if you wanted. 

Just one movement for your biceps and one for your triceps would do it on either on your upper or your lower day. I would say the day you decide to do arms, whether it be the upper or the lower, in the other day do some core work.

"You can comfortably think of the exercise as independent of your weight goals. If you keep your diet the same you will be the same weight more or less, total calories is the key factor when it comes to your bodyweight. Resistance training will not have a huge effect on that, and honestly I'd focus on just getting in the gym consistently before anything.

That being said, the big change I would look to make for your diet would definitely be higher protein intake, that will help a lot when it comes to recovery and building muscle. If you're trying to gain weight, then higher macros across the board will give you that. You just need to find your TDEE and track accurately.

As far as your training goes, just begin a basic online resistance training program or hire a coach/trainer if you need a good starting point.

Cable Machine  here you can do bicep curls and tricep push down or overhead extensions also for tricep. You can adjust the height of the cables and keep the weight light at first.

Assisted Pull-Up/Dip Machine  you can use this for dips wich mostly targets your triceps, chin ups here are also great they target your biceps quite a bit. (on this machine you can also do pull ups as well if you wanna target you back more.)

Vertical Traction Machine This mainly works your back, but it also helps build your biceps.

Shoulder Press  It works shoulders and triceps. Use light weights, and it can really help with overall arm tone,

Chest Press  Not just for chest  it also works your triceps, which are a big part of arm strength.

I don't eat a lot of sweets. But I would have no problem eating a honey bun or some loaf cake from the bakery at the end of the night with a glass of milk to get my calorie count up there.

Is this okay to do? I'm definitely not getting enough. I figured getting calories from an unhealthier source while trying to bulk some is better then not getting any at all. Will this effect my gains negatively? Will this effect hypertrophy negatively?

A food that i eat as a snack that isn't just terrible for you but easy to get calories are uncrustables or a peanut butter sandwich. It'll help you get between 200 and 500 extra calories per sandwich. I've been bulking for about 5 months trying to get to my target weight of 195lbs. I am currently 26 6'1 and weigh 185.5lbs. I started at 163 in January. I have found that it is easier for me to dirty bulk and gain weight. It is easy for me to cut fat so I don't really care about the fat gain I have while bulking.,comment_1,r/Workingout,Health,,https://www.reddit.com/r/Workingout/comments/1kpw4th/meeting_calorie_needs/
"26M, 122lbs (55kg), 5'7""(170cm). Need guidance for body transformation. I want to start transformation and need advice on workout/gym routine, calories/macros, work out and supplements. Can you guide me how do I start? 

I checked on online calories counter, my maintenance calories are ~2200 and to gain they are ~2800. I have been skinny throughout my life. The problem is I get full very quickly. But, I'm ready to consume. 

My major focus is weight gain, and muscled up in a span of 6 months (lmk if I'm being too ambitious). I follow Indian non vegetarian diet, but open to options.

Any suggestions would be extremely helpful. I have uploaded my pics. TIA.

Squats with Dumbbell or Medicine Ball, Resistance Band Rows, Glute Bridges, Push-Ups (for push ups there are alot of diffrent stances you could do more target diffrent muscles), Planks, Lateral Band Walks.

the key would be to increase repetitions  and keep consistency.

you can also look for a outside gym like a calisthenics park which is free for public, on that note you don't need a gym to get stronger but it really does make things easier.

"Hi there!

First of all, it‚Äôs great that you‚Äôre taking steps to prioritize your health, both physically and mentally. Here are a few recommendations to help you get started

Set Clear, Realistic Goals: consider setting small, achievable goals leading toward that range rather than focusing on the full amount at once. This can keep you motivated.


Start with a Balanced Workout Plan: Cardio,Strength Training,  Since you have a gym membership, machines can be a safe way to start until you‚Äôre comfortable with free weights.


Focusing on Nutrition, you already have got a decent diabetes management wich is great!, you can consider tracking your meals amd snacks for a week to get an idea of what you are actually eating, you should focus on balanced meals with lean proteins, and healthy fats. You can also consider talking  with a dietition who specializes  in diabetes for a better meal plan that fits you better.


And stay Consistent Despite a Busy Schedule, Since you‚Äôre working full-time, try scheduling your workouts like any other important appointment. Even short 20-minute workouts can make a difference!

And any progress is progress, no matter how small.
You've got this!

"Hey man - here‚Äôs what worked for me. But before I get into it remember everyone‚Äôs body is a bit different and folks respond differently across the board sometimes what works well for folks ‚Äúon average‚Äù might not be best for you specifically if you can‚Äôt consistently see progress or lift with comfort. That being said here‚Äôs what I‚Äôve done over the past 3-5 years to effectively double my chest size (I started pretty skinny so that helped lol). 

I hit chest 2x per week. And do a hybrid ppl split. On the first day that I hit chest I start with 4x8 of heavy bench press. I focus on progressively overloading here and never go above 12 reps or below 5 reps. 

Second exercise is smith machine incline bench press. I really like the stability and stretch this gives me and it‚Äôs an excellent upper chest builder. If I have a partner I like to drop set close to failure on the last set.

The third exercise I do is a decline cable fly. Typically 3 or 4 sets depending on how much time I have and how my chest is feeling.


On my second chest day I flip it around a bit and hit incline first so that I can overload better. So I‚Äôll do:

4x8 of incline barbell bench press (or smith machine or dumbbell whichever you prefer)

Then 4x8 dumbbell bench press or normal bench press

And finally heavy weighted dips but never fewer than 6 reps (these will change your life)

I‚Äôm by no means saying this is perfect or science based etc. but it has been incredibly effective for me. Specifically tracking and progressive overloading on that first day‚Äôs chest exercises.

"Incredible progress dude!! I would definitely be more consistent with sleep. 

How much of a deficit are you in? Remember as you lose weight, the maintenance gets lower, so you have to reduce calories further. 

On a cut, I always use the macros of my goal weight and once I hit it I reduce further. 

What struggles are you currently having?",comment_1,r/WorkoutRoutines,Health,,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1kuc1c1
"There's no need to cut carbs entirely and no ""magic"" happens when you do.  You're correct, carbs are your body's preferred energy source during training and necessary to drive performance. You've made great progress, you just need to keep going and be patient.

Like another commenter said above, you should try to dial in your sleep; minimum of eight hours per night if possible.  Your maintenance calories decrease with the decreasing body mass, so you will need to lower calories a little bit every month or so.

Make sure to take diet breaks when you're feeling particularly drained, hungry, aren't performing in the gym, or you just feel like giving up.  It can be a good idea to not count calories during these breaks - but eat reasonably - to give your mind a break too.

Good luck bro, you're doing great.",comment_2,r/WorkoutRoutines,Health,,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1kuc1c1
"I‚Äôd say a 600 calorie deficit. I‚Äôve added low intensity cardio 5 days a week instead of lowering food intake further as I am becoming a lot hungrier.

"18 months of progress, with most of the change coming in the last 6 months 
I was the fattest I‚Äôve ever been in 2023. Never weighed myself but based on the picture I‚Äôd say maybe 250? Not exactly sure. I‚Äôm 180 now
(5‚Äô10) 

In 2024 I made it a point to eat less and try to only eat ‚Äúnormal‚Äù foods with a good macro balance. More protein, less simple carbs, only healthy fats. 

I was still drinking heavily though, and so I‚Äôd say I lost maybe 15 pounds in 2024. 

This year I decided to stop drinking for a month which turned into 2 which turned into the whole year so far. Of course drinking less is a tried and true method for losing fat but I hadn‚Äôt realized just how much damage I was causing my body (heavy alcoholic).

Not drinking allowed me to exercise almost daily and actually get stronger and improve my cardiovascular health. I also learned how to time my macronutrients to try and optimize MPS. (200+ grams protein a day, ~40g per meal every ~2.5 hours, protein-sparing carbs with the meal) 

For workouts I did a Push/Pull split based on how I felt that day and aimed for 6 sessions a week, sometimes only did 5. 

I received a lot of pushback from my ‚Äúgym elders‚Äù for not having a set schedule but I tried that years before and quit after a few weeks because forcing myself to go on days I didn‚Äôt feel okay was tiring and I had less discipline. 

Typically, the split would be something like:

Day 1 Pull
- pull ups
- lat pull downs
- chin ups 
- isolated bicep exercises 

Day 2 Push
- Bench (2 grips)
- triceps push down? (Not sure if correct name)
- calisthenics-type dips for chest (once I was a bit stronger)
- military press
- isolated shoulder dumbbell exercises 

Day 3 Pull
- barbell rows
- deadlifts
- row machine (?)
- low-rep high-weight bicep work

Day 4 Push
- inclined chest press 
- chest fly (dumbbell and angled cable) 
- shoulder press
- skullcrushers 

Day 5 Pull 
- usually the same as day 1, variations depending on how my muscles felt 

Day 6 Push
- usually the same as day 2, variations depending on how my muscles felt 

Day 7 Rest

I would try to do about 60-90 minutes of LISS spin cycle in the evenings and resistance train in the morning. If I was going to be walking a lot on certain days I would skip the LISS and admittedly sometimes skipped LISS even when I didn‚Äôt haven‚Äôt excuse. (But very rarely skipped resistance training)

I wanted to train more and weight for even more impressive results but unfortunately I lost access to the gym for cost-saving measures. So it‚Äôll be body weight exercises and significantly less protein for the foreseeable future. I figured this would be the best time to show results then since my physique will likely suffer in the coming months.

Any critiques welcome! I‚Äôm not very well versed in the fitness world and always want to learn and try to optimize when I can. I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôll be able to regain gym access around 2026 or 2027 so hopefully muscle memory will help me",post,r/WorkoutRoutines,Health,482.0,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ktnraz

something? I leave my physique so you can see if it is

I like to train with low volume and low reps but I feel that the torso leg is accumulating a lot of exercises and this intra-workout fatigue happens.

In either case, if you want to get out of the gym quicker, sure, going one more day per week is one way of doing that.

"If you want strength, heavy compound movements are king. All the single leg and dumbbell stuff you got there is nice to have and helpful, but it should be centered around the big movements, which drive the actual progress.

Especially if you only have limited days to workout, which eliminates the main disadvantage of taking long to recover.",comment_1,r/WorkoutRoutines,Health,,https://www.reddit.com/r/WorkoutRoutines/comments/1kua1ei/full_body_functional_strength_and_athletic_program/

"Need help choosing the right split for badminton + gym training? I‚Äôve been working out for **1.5 years** and recently started playing **badminton every morning**. I tried continuing my **bro split** in the evenings for a week, but started experiencing **back pain and fatigue**, especially on back days.

Thinking of switching to **PPL** split to better manage recovery while playing badminton daily.

Here‚Äôs what my current bro split looks like:

* **Chest**: Incline dumbbell press, chest press, pec deck, cable flys, dips
* **Back**: Lat pulldown, bent-over barbell rows, pull-ups, seated rows
* **Shoulders**: Machine shoulder press, lateral raises, rear delts (pec fly), shrugs
* **Arms**: Tricep pushdown, preacher curl, skull crushers, hammer curls
* **Legs**: Squats, leg press, leg raises, hamstring curl, calf raises

"Looking for advice on my new workout schedule. Just getting back into the gym. Looking for reviews on workout routine and advice. 

Currently I‚Äôm doing a 6 day a week workout routine just getting back into it. 

Twice a week I‚Äôm doing a pull up workout (I want to improve pull-ups and grip strength specifically). This is usually wide grip pull ups, close grip pull ups, scapula retractions, and one or two ab exercises (usually hanging leg raises). 

I‚Äôm also doing incline bench press twice a week. Alongside bench press I do shoulder shrugs and sometimes dumbbell raises for shoulders but I take the dumbbells above my head. 

I squat twice a week. ATG squats. On squat days I usually either only do squats or do squats and hit abs as well (depends how my abs feel).",post,r/WorkoutRoutines,Health,2.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/WorkoutRoutines/comments/1ku2t77/looking_for_advice_on_my_new_workout_schedule/

"Good foundation. I have a similar routine, plus i do overhead press, rows, and Romanian deadlift.

Idea is to push and pull up, pouch and pull flat, and push and pull with legs. I do the important one first then follow with the opposite (example: pull ups the OHP).

Also, for abs, I do groundwork. Not sure if better than hanging - I weigh 210 and need my grip strength for everything else, plus I want the movement to be hardest when my abs are more stretched. Crunches on a decline bench get me a little extra challenge and ROM, and leg raises are like a crunch from the other direction (feet moving instead of head).",comment_2,r/WorkoutRoutines,Health,,https://www.reddit.com/r/WorkoutRoutines/comments/1ku2t77/looking_for_advice_on_my_new_workout_schedule/

"Beginner at hitting the gym, Looking for Feedback & Advice to make sure I'm doing things right Hey everyone! First-time poster here.

I recently started working out. For the entire month of April, I got back into swimming every weekend, using different strokes. I used to be a swimmer back in high school, and my initial goal was just to tone my body. But then I thought, why not hit the gym and try muscle gaining too?

What motivates me now is the fact that my lifestyle has become very sedentary ever since I graduated from college. I‚Äôm an engineer, and most of my work revolves around office and paperwork. It became even more sedentary when I got assigned outbase where I now stay 5 days a week in a staff house ‚Äî no commuting, no walking, and still stuck with office work. On top of that, this is also the first time in years that I‚Äôve been single again, and I don‚Äôt plan to get into another relationship anytime soon. So I figured now is the perfect time to focus on physical fitness since I don‚Äôt have many other activities going on.

I‚Äôve wanted to start going to the gym since I stopped growing in height. But I often felt intimidated, unconfident, or I‚Äôd wait around for a buddy to join me. Too many dates and a few past relationships also got in the way, I didn‚Äôt even set foot in a gym once, hahaha. Then I finally asked myself, when will I ever start? Am I just going to keep wasting my free time lying on bed and playing mobile games?...

Anyway! I finally started going to the gym two weeks ago. Every weekend I go back home from my outbase location. I have a condo there that‚Äôs still my main home, and I use the gym in the building because I don‚Äôt want to commit to a retail gym membership yet. I‚Äôm mixing gym workouts with swimming. Of course, since I'm a beginner and I don‚Äôt have a personal trainer, I‚Äôm organizing everything on my own with input from friends who‚Äôve worked out before. I‚Äôm posting here now to hear more advice and perspectives beyond the people I know.

A bit of background:

I‚Äôm 29, male, East Asian phenotype, and 5'7 (171 cm) tall. I‚Äôve historically been skinny since I was a kid through college. I gained about 10 kg after college ‚Äî from around 47-50 kg up to 58-60 kg ‚Äî because I decided to start eating heavily just to bulk up a bit but no exercise or whatsoever. In about 6 months back in 2018, I made my body look average-built. Thankfully, the weight I gained was evenly distributed. I‚Äôve maintained a weight of 57-60 kg ever since.

My diet consists of 3 main meals a day ‚Äî light breakfast, heavy lunch, heavy dinner. I‚Äôve never really been into snacking or junk food.

My goal isn‚Äôt to be a bodybuilder. I just want to gain enough muscle, especially in my shoulders, I want to make them to be wider/broader but still proportionate to my overall build that suits my phenotype. Of course, I‚Äôll include my lower body for proportionality, and work on my core since I‚Äôd like to have visible abs. I used to have abs when I was a swimmer in high school, but mostly because I was skinny back then, hahaha.

You can *check my photo here* in this link: [https://prnt.sc/SIkp0uT-aqAW](https://prnt.sc/SIkp0uT-aqAW) for reference. It was taken just a week ago. This is not yet a progress pic but just a reference of how my body looks like as a beginner.

* Butterfly/Chest Press
* Leg Press
* Dead Hang Bar
* Treadmill

**Diet:**

I aim for 2200‚Äì2500 calories on sedentary days and 2500‚Äì2900 on workout days, as well as 90‚Äì120g of protein daily. I haven‚Äôt added supplements like whey or creatine, keeping things all natural for now. But I‚Äôm curious, do you think either of these (or both) are necessary, or totally optional? I'm following a calorie-surplus diet now for muscle gaining.

Last time I weighed myself (2 weeks ago), I thought I was 60 kg already because I noticed fat accumulation, especially around my chest and tummy, one reason I finally pushed myself to work out. But I was surprised to find I was only 57 kg. Although, I didn‚Äôt get to check my weight before I started swimming again in April, so perhaps it made me lose some weight.

**Questions:**

1. When do you usually increase your weights? What system do you use to decide?
2. What‚Äôs your best method for managing or shortening DOMS? Or does it just naturally fade as your body adapts?
3. Is it okay to take a capsule of ibuprofen when dealing with DOMS?
4. Should I consider whey or creatine? Or is sticking with a natural diet enough?

What do you think of my overall program? I‚Äôd love to hear your thoughts and suggestions. I‚Äôm really hoping to see visible progress in 2 months and significant results in 6 months!

TL;DR:

Just started working out after years of being sedentary. I‚Äôm 29, male, East Asian features, 5‚Äô7 (171 cm), 57 kg. Made a beginner-friendly gym and swim program using my condo gym. Would love feedback, advice, and thoughts! Full routine and questions above.

Thanks in advance! I‚Äôll appreciate your comments.",post,r/WorkoutRoutines,Health,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/WorkoutRoutines/comments/1ku3tg1/beginner_at_hitting_the_gym_looking_for_feedback/
"Massive respect for the detail and commitment you‚Äôre putting in ‚Äî seriously. You‚Äôve already done something most people never get past: you *started*, and you‚Äôve stuck with it. You‚Äôre building the foundation the right way.

Your plan looks great for your goals. You‚Äôre balancing swimming with gym work, using compound lifts, and even doing core separately ‚Äî it‚Äôs clear you‚Äôre thinking intentionally.

A few thoughts that might help:

* **Progressive overload:** Every 2‚Äì3 weeks, bump either reps or weight slightly if a set starts to feel ‚Äúcomfortable.‚Äù Tiny progress is still progress.
* **DOMS:** Ibuprofen is okay occasionally, but consistent soreness will fade as your body adapts. Sleep, hydration, and light movement (like swimming or walking) help most.
* **Creatine:** Totally safe and effective if you want to support muscle growth. 3‚Äì5g/day. Whey? Optional ‚Äî only if you struggle to hit your protein needs through food.

And if you want a tool that helps keep everything consistent without overcomplicating things, I built [**NudgeFit+**](https://nudgefit.app/) (https://nudgefit.app/) for exactly that. It keeps your focus on *doing the work regularly*, with nudges, habit tracking, and structure to build discipline ‚Äî especially when life or motivation dips.

Keep going, man. With your mindset and routine, you‚Äôre 100% going to see results.",comment_1,r/WorkoutRoutines,Health,,https://www.reddit.com/r/WorkoutRoutines/comments/1ku3tg1/beginner_at_hitting_the_gym_looking_for_feedback/
"Workout Routine Help Hey everyone,

I‚Äôve been training consistently for almost a year now and wanted to share my current workout plan‚Äîsomething I built from scratch after struggling with other programs. I‚Äôve gone through several different workout programs and splits‚ÄîPush/Pull/Legs, Full Body‚Äîbut I always ran into the same issue: rotating exercises every few weeks. I know variety has its place, but constantly swapping lifts made me feel like I was starting from scratch each time. I prefer sticking with the same core movements so I can get better at them over time, track progress more effectively, and not waste energy learning new form cues every month.

26 M - 5'9"" - 250 lbs

Primary Goals: Fat loss, improved overall health, and decent muscle mass/strength

Split: Upper/Lower (2 days each, 4-day weekly structure)

Cardio: 2‚Äì3 light/moderate sessions per week

Time Limit: Max. 60 mins

I‚Äôve been running this for a few weeks and it feels great so far, but I‚Äôd love to hear if you see any imbalances, redundancies, or missed opportunities in this setup? Would appreciate any tweaks or suggestions you might offer!

Thanks in advance!

"Not a direct answer to your question, but as an aside, I know it feels daunting at first. My experience was that spending a minimum of 8-10 weeks with a routine made me feel very competent in those movements. Then switching to a new one made every workout take longer, having to look stuff up, not having a good feel for how to use or setup the machine, what weight to use, etc.

I will say though, now that I‚Äôve spent about 8 months working out, and having gone through 3 full programs, it gets MUCH easier to incorporate new stuff. The variety early on means that now, I feel super comfortable reaching for cable machines, free weights, whatever. It means that, when I look at a program to compare notes, I can pick and choose what I enjoy doing, knowing I have kind of a mental library of exercises to target any particular muscle group.

For instance, you may want to increase your bench, or work on your lats a bit more, or maybe your triceps. That comes with time. In my opinion

  
Beginning split should be push/pull/legs (what you have), and just working on getting in the habit of the gym and getting your form. Do this for 6 weeks and then split to something a bit more advanced.

"Another user on here put me onto the idea of doing a 100 hour fast (4 days) of only water while still exercising at high frequency. These are the results after 70 hours. Wow. 100 hours - water only. Not to prove anything. Just to see if I could. Leading up to this, Ive read the studies, listened to podcasts, and experimented with different fasting methods the past year. However, nothing I've read or felt prior truly prepared me for the mental side of it.

Hunger isn‚Äôt just physical. It creeps into your mind, takes up space, and slows time. Every hour becomes a quiet negotiation with yourself. Thoughts get loud. Food becomes less about craving and more about habit, distraction, or reward. Still, I kept going. Until I didn‚Äôt.

I chose to stop at 70 hours. Not out of weakness, or even hunger, but from something more innate: listening. My body said this is far enough. And I respected that.
The shift was subtle, but real. I feel lighter not just in my body, but in my mind. More focused. Like something static had cleared.

To the Redditor who inspired this, thank you! Your post lit a fire I didn‚Äôt know I needed. I didn‚Äôt walk the whole road, but I saw enough of it to know that I'm able, so it's only a matter of time.

"Doctor here - you‚Äôre on the right track but not quite there. 

Autophagy is a catabolic pathway found in all living cells. By definition, it is a lysosomal mediated self-digestion of a cell‚Äôs cytoplasmic contents into life‚Äôs basic elements to allow for recycling of limited resources. ‚ÄòInducing autophagy‚Äô is a fancy way of saying you‚Äôre ‚Äôinducing catabolism‚Äô which is a fancy way of saying that your energy in is less than your energy out. In the absence of fuel, your body begins burning itself to fuel more crucial functions - like your internal organs. 

You‚Äôre correct that autophagy improves cellular health by essentially recycling old machinery. You‚Äôre also correct that autophagy can be triggered by starvation or intense exercise. It‚Äôs important to remember acuity chronicity. Chronic autophagy brought on by progressive overload leads to recycling of muscle cells into stronger, newer muscle cells. Acute autophagy, which you‚Äôre hoping to achieve with 4 days of starvation, recycles your muscles into energy for your brain, heart, lungs etc. since your skeletal muscles aren‚Äôt essential for life. 

It‚Äôs also important to remember that catabolism is brought on by hormones typically released during times of physiologic stress - cortisol, epinephrine (adrenaline as you might know it), renin/aldosterone etc. In the acute setting, they‚Äôll suppress your anabolic hormones but the axis quickly shuts off and healthy homeostasis is maintained. That‚Äôs kinda how ‚Äòchronic autophagy‚Äô works. 

What you risk doing is prolonging the activation of your stress pathways, which leads your body to believe it‚Äôs chronically under stress. So it holds onto water, prefers to store calories as fats vs proteins (fats are much more efficient in terms of energy access) and elevates your blood pressure to keep the train chugging as fast as possible. Where you‚Äôre incorrect is that it ‚Äòreduces inflammation.‚Äô Catabolism is inherently a pro-inflammatory state, which in the short term is great, but long term, not so much. (In terms of cells, short/long term is essentially >18h) 

TLDR: though you look nice after 4d of starvation, you‚Äôve worsened your overall cardiovascular/physiologic health. If you continue this cycle, you will end up losing gains in the long run.

"Shoulder exercises to complement lateral raises? I have bad shoulders from sleeping on my stomach with my arm up and 15 years of grappling... Lat raises are the only shoulder exercise I've found that isn't incredibly uncomfortable in my joint and my shoulders are very very weak compared to other muscle groups. Tried overhead press with barbells and dumbbells, shoulder press machines, upright rows and they all hurt and not in the good way... If just doubling up on lat raises is a feasible solution I'm fine with that but I usually prefer to have at least 2 movements per muscle group.

Anyone else with shoulder issues able to weigh in?",post,r/WorkoutRoutines,Health,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/WorkoutRoutines/comments/1ksybk2/shoulder_exercises_to_complement_lateral_raises/
"Lateral raises are super fine but for variation you can take a look at cable lateral raises, cable/dumbbell Y raises, lean-in lateral raises, lying lateral raises. Most don't require a lot of load and that can be an advantage for you. Also, face pulls and reverse dumbbell/machine/cable flys for rear delts.",comment_1,r/WorkoutRoutines,Health,,https://www.reddit.com/r/WorkoutRoutines/comments/1ksybk2/shoulder_exercises_to_complement_lateral_raises/

"I'm in the same boat. But, since you don't need to rest that much between sides they don't have to take that long. Lean in lateral raises can be done with dumbbells too. Also, look at dual cable lateral raises. It's bilateral. Set the cable height at the very bottom for now and see how your shoulders feel.

"Day 100 update! I have made a post before on here showing pictures from day 0 to day 50. Since then I have stuck to my diet, gym-routine and continued walking a lot. I had promised to make a follow-up post on day 100, today is that day.

My current workout split is a semi-traditional push-pull-legs split where I aim to hit two days of gym with an off day in between resulting in going to the gym for resistance-training around 4-5 times a week. On the off days from the gym I tend to run a 4-mile. Every day I also try to walk at least 10.000 steps, which has significantly helped me lose a little more weight.

Weight:
Day 0: 131.5KG
Day 50: 115.1KG
Day 100: 104.2KG Total weight lost: -27.3KG (~60 lbs)

Feel free to ask questions! I will try to answer all questions!

My current daily calorie-intake is around 2300 calories, reverse-dieting from 1700 at the point of starting my cut.

"To be fair with regards to my energy levels I feel like they haven't really changed much at all. Throughout the whole process I've only had like 5 days where I felt as though my energy was drained. To answer your question about go-to meals; I eat a 500g serving of what we call 'kwark' here twice a day; high in protein, no fats and super satiating, they carry me throughout the day. Other then that I feel like my diet is mostly pretty normal, I have a regular sandwich for lunch, some high protein snack before dinner (think chicken or like a protein shake) and just have some regular dutch-style dinner. A typical dinner would be something like potatoes, boiled veggies like broccoli and a decent serving of meat, be it fish, pork or beef. I also tend to drink a lot to stay 'full' if that makes sense.

"Hi Chloe :).
  
Been suffering for a few years now.  It's manifestations can be awful and really debilitating.
  
Mine works in waves or cycles.
  
First of all you'll notice a symptom or bodily sensation that might be real or just a normal symptom (headache, tiredness, ache after exercise).  Your brain immediately goes to the worst case scenario with these symptoms.  It's never I have a leg ache because I had a hard run last night, it's immediately what if that's a tumour, what if that's a metastatic cancer.
  
You then spend the next hours/days and weeks checking this leg ache, checking if your calves are the same size, measuring them taking photos.  Long after the initial symptoms should have gone (but haven't due to constantly touching and rubbing them), you then over analyse how you walk, how your leg feels all throughout the day, your leg nerves and muscles are the loudest possible sensations in your body 
  
All while this is going on, you seek reassurance so you search forums, go on Google, ask friends in a roundabout way and you come across an anecdote or story about a random person dying of leg cancer and their symptoms were leg cancer and shortness of breath.
  
The next day your body makes you short of breath, so you start breathing funny, analysing your breathing and it starts to give you chest pains.  Well you remember from a googling session months ago that this could be the sign of a blood clot on the lung.  

Before long you've forgotten your leg cancer and you're obsessed with your imminent death from a PE.
  
This is my life day to day, I have good days and bad days.  Imagine the above story that bounces around my whole body.  Not believing doctors, getting side effects from medication after reading the pamphlet.
  
It's a cruel disease, I'm in therapy and take SSRIs, which are definitely helping...",comment_1,r/HealthAnxiety,Health,,https://www.reddit.com/r/HealthAnxiety/comments/1kn38l4/journalist_reporting_on_health_anxiety/
"I‚Äôm sure you have plenty of great testimony at this point, but if I had to make one ask, it‚Äôs that you call out the fact that health anxiety is a form of OCD the DSM does not yet recognize‚Ä¶ and needs to desperately catch up. The treatments for OCD are so much more effective (ICBT, ERP) in dealing with ‚Äúhealth anxiety‚Äù than normal CBT or DBT. I have struggled with OCD since I was fourteen, manifesting in multiple sub-types (harm, relationship, etc) and eventually it turned into health-related OCD. I do not consider it ‚Äúanxiety.‚Äù It behaves the same way as OCD. Ruminating, looping thoughts, defining your entire life by the obsession, compulsions (checking, avoiding, reassurance seeking)‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs a beast of a condition. If you could somehow include a mention of the parallel between OCD and ‚Äúhealth anxiety‚Äù, you would be doing right by many many people and I bet more people would get the proper diagnosis/effective treatments.

"It‚Äôs so interesting how many of us understand exactly what is meant by ‚Äúhealth anxiety‚Äù and the impacts it has on our life, but how many of us have received different diagnoses. 

My diagnosis is just ‚Äúanxiety‚Äù, but all of my ruminations center on health issues. Over the past few years, as I‚Äôve done therapy and learned more vocabulary to explain what is happening in my brain, several practitioners have begun to say ‚ÄúHmm, that actually sounds like OCD to me.‚Äù This tracks for me‚ÄîI read ‚ÄúTurtles All the Way Down‚Äù by John Green a few years ago and have never related to a fictional character more in my life. 

The thing that is trickiest for me is that my health anxiety is born out of *actual* health issues‚Äîa couple of traumatic health events that I witnessed as a child AND a couple of health events of my own (cancer, twice). So, sometimes it‚Äôs hard to parse out what are reasonable concerns given my health history and what are compulsions/ruminations.

"AI is the single best thing for health anxiety Hear me out. I have always had awful health anxiety where I get pulled into the internet spiral of doom. AI has helped me so much with this. I use ChatGPT 4o, so I‚Äôm not sure about the simpler models, but basically for any worry, I outline the concern, I explain I‚Äôm concerned, and then I ask for odds on what the cause is. 

I could be wrong, but I assume other worriers are also fairly analytical and are helped by seeing odds repeatedly for reassurance.  

With AI, you can get the answers you need to those ridiculous questions only we think about. For example, I recently learned that I‚Äôd used non food grade tubing on a reverse osmosis system.  It was only a couple of feet, but I began to freak out about chemicals. Using AI, I was able to do ridiculously tedious things like determine the possible chemicals, the risks, the actual water amount that might have sat in the tube (.3 ounces), and learned probably far too much about how tube classifications work. Now obviously, this is overkill for most people, but for health worriers, it‚Äôs awesome to have a calm and knowledgeable tool that can answer any ridiculous question, while not pointing to stupid Google sites - I.e healthline. 

I will never again use Google for searches if I can help it.",post,r/HealthAnxiety,Health,432.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/HealthAnxiety/comments/1hpqyxp/ai_is_the_single_best_thing_for_health_anxiety/
"Unfortunately, this is the exact opposite thing you should be doing if you ever want to truly manage and overcome health anxiety. 

I understand the appeal of having what is essentially a 24/7, on-call reassurance machine, and it might calm you in the moment, but reassurance seeking will only dig you deeper into the anxiety hole and make it that much harder to climb out. And as others here have mentioned, the information you‚Äôre getting has the ~~strong~~ possibility of being wrong. 

Therapeutic treatment for health anxiety is largely the same as therapeutic treatment for OCD, with rule No. 1 being that it is essential to learn to live with the uncertainty of your fears. Using an LLM to quell your fears is really no different than constant googling, constant checking with family/friends, or repeated, unnecessary doctor visits.

My unsolicited advice would be to curb your AI usage and see if you can meet with an OCD specialist if you‚Äôre not seeing one already.

"Took my first ambulance to the hospital Sunday. The way the staff treated me is something I can‚Äôt shake. It was traumatic TLDR on bottom. 

On Sunday evening, I suddenly developed crushing chest pain, tremors in my chest, clammy skin, dizziness, shortness of breath, confusion, and numbness in my face and arm while cooking dinner. My heart rate was over 150 bpm. I was so disoriented I couldn‚Äôt shut off the stove. My husband called 911, and they instructed him to give me four aspirin before the ambulance arrived. I left the house in only a long T-shirt and socks cause I could barely walk. This was the first time I had ever needed emergency transport.

Triage notes falsely claimed my symptoms lasted a few minutes and resolved. That is not true‚ÄîI was still symptomatic upon discharge. 

There is no EMS report in my file, despite my elevated heart rate, blood pressure and QTc during transport. I requested to go to one hospital when they asked my preference, but they brought me to a different one instead. 

During transport, the EMT repeatedly insisted it was ‚Äújust anxiety‚Äù and that ‚Äúthis happens to women your age.‚Äù He continued minimizing my symptoms in the ER waiting room. Another EMT questioned the significance of my EKG but was ignored. I mentioned my iron deficiency and how my PCP has been fighting for me to get an infusion, but it was dismissed. While in the waiting room, the EMT came back and again told me ‚ÄúI guarantee it‚Äôs anxiety!‚Äù

At the hospital, my BP was 164/102 and my HR was still 132 bpm. My EKG showed a QTc of 596 ms. My hemoglobin, RBC, and potassium were the lowest they‚Äôve ever been to date. Despite this, I received minimal care. The hospital EKG tech and phlebotomist casually discussed being hungover from the night before. 

When I couldn‚Äôt walk to X-ray, the male nurse rolled his eyes and said, ‚ÄúI guess the wheelchair it is.‚Äù While bringing me to X-ray, he asked me to leave the hospital a 5-star review.

I only saw the nurse who discharged me twice. Once for IV fluids and a potassium pill and again to rush me home. No one asked how I was feeling or investigated my chest pain further. When I asked if my low CBC and Potassium could‚Äôve contributed to what happened, I was simply told to ‚Äúeat healthier,‚Äù even after explaining I already eat an iron-rich diet, take supplements, and drink around 2 liters of water daily. The nurse admitted he hadn‚Äôt personally  reviewed my labs and dismissed the flagged EKG results. He said ‚ÄúIf there was anything abnormal, they would‚Äôve told me.‚Äù

At the sign out desk, my IV site began gushing blood, soaking through the bandage, my clothes, and pooling on the floor. It looked like a crime seen. A nurse eventually replaced the bandage without asking how I‚Äôm feeling. The lady at the sign out desk randomly started talking about buying Louis Vuitton on Amazon while my IV site was running like a faucet. The nurse said ‚ÄúNext time maybe you should use your words to tell them you bleed a lot so this type of things doesn‚Äôt happen.‚Äù I told her I made them aware of how I‚Äôm due for iron infusions and that I have anemia and she said ‚ÄúYou probably just think you told them.‚Äù Then she asked the woman at the sign out desk to page housekeeping to ‚Äúclean up this mess.‚Äù 

No one offered me anything to clean up. I left the hospital covered in blood, in a blood soaked shirt and bloody socks. Three people including security asked if I needed help and if everything was okay on my way out. At that point I was so traumatized I just wanted to go home‚Ä¶. 

The hospital told my PCP I was simply seen for ‚Äúdizziness,‚Äù which is untrue. My triage notes said ‚Äúpatient had chest pressure and claims she experienced a ‚Äúwave‚Äù of dizziness that resolved in minutes before calling EMS.‚Äù

At my PCP follow-up, I was told to go back to the ER due to new right-sided chest pain when inhaling that began the day after discharge. But after this recent experience, I‚Äôm too scared. All it took was an EMT who thought I was anxious to set the tone for the rest of my visit. I could never imagine treating someone in such a way. 


TL;DR:
I was rushed to the ER with crushing chest pain, numbness, a 150+ bpm heart rate, dizziness, clammy skin, high blood pressure and numbness. EMS and ER staff dismissed it as anxiety despite a QTc of 596 ms and my lowest-ever blood counts to date. I was treated rudely, not properly examined, and discharged still symptomatic. At the sign out desk, my IV site bled all over me and the floor only to get scolded by the nurse as if it was my fault. They gave me nothing to clean up with. I was sent home in a blood soaked t shirt and socks. My record falsely says I went in for ‚Äúdizziness‚Äù that resolved in minutes before contacting EMS. This experience worsened my PTSD from prior medical neglect, including a mismanaged CSF leak that left me suffering for over a year.",post,r/ChronicIllness,Health,156.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChronicIllness/comments/1kughbl/took_my_first_ambulance_to_the_hospital_sunday/

"I‚Äôm in the US.  Before I got my iron transfusions we had to wait on my insurance.  

I had to prove that not only was I anemic enough (my iron bottomed out) because they won‚Äôt do it if your iron isn‚Äôt below a certain threshold, I also had to prove that I didn‚Äôt respond to dietary changes (I did not, I ate a high iron diet, avoided anything that would inhibit iron at mealtimes, and ate foods to boost iron absorption with my iron rich foods!)  

I also had to try iron supplements as well and prove those didn‚Äôt work (iron pills made me very ill and didn‚Äôt raise my iron level, liquid iron I tolerated better but it also was ineffective at raising my iron).  

After all that, and my iron getting lower, my insurance denied the first type of iron iv treatment we requested (and we had to wait to hear from them), and then approved the second type (again had to wait to hear back).

So it took a bit from the initial, ‚Äúoh JFC, you are so ungodly anemic you need iron literally right now,‚Äù until I was actually able to get it.  And that was the second time we knew my iron had dropped low like that (the first time was like a decade earlier when I tried going vegetarian, and we first learned iron pills were ineffective and made me ill, and that dietary changes were the only way I could control my iron dependably, and even then I still tended towards anemia.

I've seen characters in shows get checked out because they think they're having a heart attack and it turns out to be a panic attack. My panic attacks have never felt like what I imagine a heart attack would feel like. Have any of yours?,post,r/ChronicIllness,Health,47.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChronicIllness/comments/1kuiawe/ive_seen_characters_in_shows_get_checked_out/
"I have had both. 

What I felt during my heart attack was so minor, all I felt was the urgent need to sit down and a tightness right behind my sternum. The second heart attack was in the hospital and I laughed at the doctor when she told me and said ""wait, wait, wait I need to call my husband and have you tell him because he won't believe me"" he would have thought I was pranking him.

A panic attack felt more like what I would expect a heart attack to feel like.",comment_1,r/ChronicIllness,Health,,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChronicIllness/comments/1kuiawe/ive_seen_characters_in_shows_get_checked_out/
"Not like a heart attack. 

But my very first panic attack was at 18. And I had no idea what was happening. Couldn't catch my breath, my heart was pounding, my mind was racing. 

Now, I was with a good friend, and she was able to help me calm down. 

She had had panic attacks before and recognized it. I eventually got help. 

I think the trope is for folks older in life who get their first panic attack. They too don't know what's happening the first time around. They just know it's hard to catch their breath, maybe their chest or body feels tight, and something feels very, very wrong. 

At that age, one of your biggest fears is dying of a heart attack because that's what killed your mom or dad. So you assume that's what it is. And we know how panic works - feed the brain a fear - it makes it happen. So now you are afraid you are having a heart attack just like dad did. So your chest starts feeling tighter. It's a loop.

"No but my costochondritis has. 

My panic attacks are usually very jittery (like after too many inhaler puffs type jittery), hyperventilating, tachycardia, very emotionally distressed sometimes with hysterical sobbing or rocking. 

I believe panic attacks can feel different depending on the individual. For some, it might feel like chest pain, for others it might feel like a physical explosion of anxiety. 

My electrophysiologist told me a good way to tell if it‚Äôs ‚Äúthe big one‚Äù vs a musculoskeletal issue is if you can point to the pain, it‚Äôs probably musculoskeletal, as cardiac pain is pretty diffuse.",comment_5,r/ChronicIllness,Health,,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChronicIllness/comments/1kuiawe/ive_seen_characters_in_shows_get_checked_out/
"Mother told me I caused my own disability 
She legit said it was my fault that I have Crohn's disease because I hurt my body with oral/patch birth control instead of listening to her.

It's only going to stop my periods, not the other issues my pcos causes but whatever. 

She also only won me over to do it after I was told I could get sedation. I got sedation, threw up after but was relatively fine. Screamed at me for getting sedation and blamed me for vomiting. Like bro YOU told me to get sedation.

Then she related me to her Bipolar brother and said I never listen to her and that's why I wasted my life and could have been graduated right now. My dad literally stole my college fund...so um. I think it's his fault, perchance.

"I've had several endoscopies and colonoscopies. The prep kinda sucks but it's livable. I can't drink the regular colonoscopy prep stuff (texture issues make me vomit) so they give me pills now. The pills cause more cramping than the drink but I'm happy to make that sacrifice. My advice is to get some wipes (don't flush them no matter what the package says) if you don't have a bidet. You're gonna be going a lot and the toilet paper starts to irritate the skin. 

The colonoscopy itself is a breeze. They'll give you a hospital gown that's open in the back. Then they'll get you on a gurney, ask you a bunch of questions, start an IV, and wheel you back to the procedure room. You'll meet your whole team, they'll ask you some more questions, then they'll ask you to roll onto your side and they'll start the anaesthetic. When you wake up you'll probably be a little groggy with a sore throat. They'll give you some water while you wake up fully. Then your doctor will discuss the results with you and let you get dressed. I advise taking the day off and just resting as much as possible. You may experience some bleeding (especially if they took any biopsies) but it shouldn't be a lot. 

Endoscopy procedures are super similar once you get to the medical center. Same thing with the gown, gurney, IV, questions, etc. Afterwards the doctor will discuss the results and you can go home. You're more likely to have a sore throat.

"I don't date. Probably not the answer you want to hear and would be interested in hearing others.

But every time I even consider trying to date and spin up a dating app or anything I am exhausted just thinking about it. Admittedly this may depend on your chronic illness but at least for me I use up all my energy just existing, holding down a job, and maybe the occasional social event with a friend I don't have the energy to pursue a relationship. I also struggle with self esteem a lot due to my illnesses--adaptations I am embarrassed about needing because they come off as too quirky,  weight gains due to medications and illnesses, not having time to pursue hobbies and be ""interesting"" enough to date, etc. 

But obviously these are all just personal reasons to me. If you think you can pursue and manage a relationship in addition to your illness I see no reason not to date. For me it's just not something I can really manage at the moment and as much as I hate that, it's just how it is right now.",comment_1,r/ChronicIllness,Health,,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChronicIllness/comments/1kuf867/how_do_yall_navigate_dating_with_unpredictable/

"When my conditions were unstable, and I used to date, I was extremely selective. And I‚Äôm gonna be real, I didn‚Äôt go on very many dates.

Depending on your illness(es), and how much you‚Äôre willing to disclose and how early on, you just have to accept that some people are gonna be ok with unpredictable, but justifiable ‚Äúflaking,‚Äù ‚Äújust‚Äù hanging out, and others are not. Some might seem ok with it at first, but when they see this isn‚Äôt a temporary thing, they start to drift. A lot of people want consistency, predictability, and excitement in the dating phase.

And then there are snakes who will seem accommodating, but will see you as an easy target for manipulation because of your condition. And if you are disabled? You are SIGNIFICANTLY more likely to experience intimate partner violence than an abled person.

Bottom line: Date cautiously. Be selective. Don‚Äôt get too attached too soon. Be prepared for decent people to disappoint you too. Remember that that‚Äôs ok. People can still be decent people but have their own needs that don‚Äôt converge with yours. Quality over quantity. Try not to feel sad if you don‚Äôt go on as many dates as you‚Äôd like. It‚Äôs better not to waste your time with people who aren‚Äôt worth it. And don‚Äôt feel guilty for ‚Äúflaking‚Äù because of your illness. We have to always put ourselves first. Other people will always come and go, and in the end we are the only people we have to know we can rely on.

But also allow people the opportunity to surprise you with how kind and awesome they can be.",comment_3,r/ChronicIllness,Health,,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChronicIllness/comments/1kuf867/how_do_yall_navigate_dating_with_unpredictable/

"How to keep going with severe medical fatigue Hey everyone, 

Thanks in advance for reading. I‚Äôm open to suggestions and advice as well as commiseration. 

I‚Äôm coming off a stretch of medium-bad doctor appointments. Nothing earth shatteringly awful, just the standard not being believed/helped stuff.

I‚Äôve had so many medical issues, appointments, treatments, etc. and I‚Äôm feeling exhausted deep in my soul. Like if I could keep living while doing nothing medical, I would. I know part of it is due to having a major surgery and developing CRPS afterwards. That suuuuucked, but the surgery itself was successful and it was expected to improve or even cure several of my major health problems. And it kind of did, at least for awhile, but new and old/back burner stuff have risen to fill in that space. 

I‚Äôm in therapy (and a therapist myself), have supportive friends and family, a career I like, two children who I love more than anything, and a GREAT pcp finally, and yet it‚Äôs all feeling like too much. 

So, how do you keep keeping on?

My issue besides getting my dad to hekonme set up downstairs before I'm gray is I'm having major issues getting around with just a stupid cane... I have a chair camped out in my kitchen because any exertion and my back goes to an 8 and I have to immediately sit... Plus I've never managed proper timing between my feet and arm lol. I'm not sure how to get around downstairs between it being a fight to get off the couch without sorts rolling off because my core is a joke and making it from the couch to the bathroom off the kitchen is exhausting. I'm not sure what I can use to get around as the standing rollator will be too heavy to get up the front steps probably as I can barely handle the regular 15lb one I have.

I'm not able to do so many things and the waiting lists for other doctors are sooooo long!  I myself think its mild ME/CFS, or something similar., but on the other hand I don't feel like I'm sick ""enough"", yes I can't do a lot of things, but I read other peoples experience and I start doubting myself. The only way I've delt with this is, I don't think anymore that I'll become healthy again(I'm not sure if this is smart or not, but I kind of have just accepted, this is my life now, live with it). Try focusing on all the small moments of joy in everyday life! Just seeing the sun shine, or hearing a bird sing is great! Try focusing on what you can do, instead of what you cannot.

"Weird neurological symptoms? Hey everyone‚Äî

I‚Äôm trying to figure out if what I‚Äôm experiencing could be???

Over the past couple weeks, I‚Äôve had a cluster of strange neurological symptoms that don‚Äôt feel like anxiety or typical migraines, and I‚Äôm hoping someone here might relate. These ‚Äúepisodes‚Äù are currently occurring every 1-3 min, and only last for about 15 seconds but the continuous cycle has me exhausted, feeling defeated, and hard to make it thru the day.

Here‚Äôs what I‚Äôve been dealing with:
-A sudden squeezing/pressure weird feeling in brain (also feels like my brain internally has a chill in addition to this)
-Sudden adrenaline rushes that feel like my whole body goes into fight-or-flight mode
-altered sound perception during the episode, like my ears are clogged or full of water
-I have no idea how to explain it but my eyes feel just weird during the episode and one pupil has consistently been visibly larger than the other recently
-light/sound sensitivity (this is also consistent)
-Moments where I completely forget what I was doing or saying mid-task
-Occasional difficulty finding words or using the wrong word in a sentence
-Emotional shifts (confusion, fear, or blankness) that come out of nowhere
-A sensation like my body ‚Äúforgets what to do‚Äù for a second‚Äîalmost like a lag or stutter in coordination
-my short term memory has suddenly became shot, which has been super hard because I‚Äôve always had the memory of an elephant.
-These episodes often leave me foggy, exhausted, or spaced out afterward

For context:
-Migraine meds (both Fioricet and Reglan) haven‚Äôt helped. I‚Äôve tried these taken with Benadryl as well with no help.
-I went to the ER two days ago and got the ‚Äúyour CT and labs look fine so you‚Äôre not dying‚Äù and they suggested some weird migraine. They said I shouldn‚Äôt be concerned about my left pupil because my CT was normal.
-I have a neuro appointment on the 29th and a 30 min EEG scheduled before the appointment. This is my first visit to neurology ever.
-I‚Äôve seen cardio, was started on midridine for low blood pressure and ‚ÄúPOTS-Y‚Äù like symptoms but haven‚Äôt started it yet. Did a poor man‚Äôs tilt test in office at cardio and PCP and showed major changes in BP/HR. 
-I also randomly have full body adrenaline rush type feelings, body temperature dis regulation, and I pass out about once a week.
-I have inflammatory arthritis, Ankylosing spondylitis, coronary spasms (prinzmetal angina) history of Migranes with kaleidoscope auroras, and degenerative disc disease in my neck.",post,r/ChronicIllness,Health,3.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChronicIllness/comments/1kuai7f/weird_neurological_symptoms/

"has anyone been in the same situation? hi everyone! this is my first time posting in this group, i feel so alone and i just need someone to vent to or to gain some advice?

so, i was born with symptomatic intestinal malrotation, my kidneys and bladder have always hated me. my first symptoms was at 3 months old when i had a uti, then again and 10 months old and from then it‚Äôs been between every 3 weeks to a month of week long uti‚Äôs. from age 3 i was put on proflyaxis(?) medication but i‚Äôve now become resistant to mostly all of them. i‚Äôve had every test done under the book and have been on any medication you can think of, absolutely nothing has worked.

fast forward to now, im 22 and two months ago i went into full urinary retention at 1.4L and the only pain i had was back discomfort, i‚Äôm so used to pain that im now a risk to myself because i just don‚Äôt know when im not well, i haven‚Äôt had a fever since i was very young. i was admitted overnight and sent home with a flip flow catheter that has now been taken out and i self catheterise twice a day to keep retention at bay.

a week ago i started to notice pain in my urethra, which is an immediate red flag for me. i phoned my GP and said that i have a uti but i‚Äôm resistant to everything down to Cipro and i‚Äôm in a lot of pain and i have flu symptoms. she prescribed me a medication im resistant, im allergic to penicillin so a lot of meds are off the table for me. 

fast forward even more to today, im sweating without a fever, cannot go to the toilet at all (yes, everything is at a standstill) and the abx im on aren‚Äôt touching the sides, i phone 111 and get an ooh appointment and luckily, the doctor i saw is absolutely wonderful, she really listened and understood what i was saying. she did my dip sick and before it even finished i was flashing up for different bacteria‚Äôs and blood, she even said ‚Äúwoah this is a full blown uti‚Äù. she had to put me on a abx that im resistant to but has put a note on my chart to say that if this doesn‚Äôt work i need to be admitted because my bp readings are really low and with the flu symptoms not shifting, she‚Äôs worried i cant fight any infections and i can go into sepsis. 

i had a urodynamic study done four days ago, they called the specialist in while i was in the room to make sure it was safe for me to go home and they said they think i have fowlers syndrome and im being referred to a different city to see a specialist.

now this is bit is what‚Äôs hard for me, i live with my best friend and she says i just need to ‚Äúpush‚Äù it all out. she got defensive when i called her dense as she‚Äôs been my main support through this and she‚Äôs been absolutely wonderful, she‚Äôs sat in a&e with me for hours, was helping me when i was ill and she‚Äôs just been all around brilliant, it‚Äôs just the comments she‚Äôs making is making me feel stupid i guess? am i being dramatic? is it the pain talking? 

sorry for such a long one, i just needed to get it off my chest. any info or even a pick me up would be greatly appreciated :)",post,r/ChronicIllness,Health,3.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChronicIllness/comments/1kua12a/has_anyone_been_in_the_same_situation/
"That's really rough, I'm sorry.

I don't have any advice about your illness, but it sounds like you're doing everything you can to get the support you need. I hope you feel better soon and get over this infection. 

About your friend, I think this is normal for both of you. It's a stressful time for you, and she's not really sensitive to it since she's not going through it and doesn't know what it's like to have your condition. It's normal for her to say insensitive things, and it's normal for you to be upset at her for it. Hopefully you both can come back and resolve the issue once you tell her how her comments make you feel.

"Ugh. Sounds awful. The only thing that might be remotely helpful is that I somewhat recently learned that childhood penicillin allergies are often outgrown as adults. 

Due to my lung issues I am on antibiotics a lot. I had rashes as a child with some sort of penicillin (maybe Nafcillin) and even had anaphylaxis with Cephtrixone. I was deemed allergic to all penicillins. I went through maybe a decade plus where every hospital admission started with desensitization in the PICU in order to take IV Meropenem and Ceftazadime (the only drugs that my bacteria were sensitive to). It was literal hell. I also could never do home IV due to being allergic to these meds, which was so unfortunate as my mom was a nurse.

I‚Äôm 28 now and Ceftazadime/Avycaz is really my only sensitive IV antibiotic. I‚Äôm not allergic to it anymore tho and I routinely do home IV (infusion pharmacy literally just ships me meds and I access my own port so I can forgo the hospital all together) with both Mero and Ceftaz. Haven‚Äôt gotten antibiotic rashes or allergy signs in decades. 

Of course the risk for spontaneous allergy is alway there, it may be helpful to know that a childhood penicillin allergy doesn‚Äôt mean that you may never be able to tolerate that drug.",comment_3,r/ChronicIllness,Health,,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChronicIllness/comments/1kua12a/has_anyone_been_in_the_same_situation/

"My partner and I are also long distance, we‚Äôve been together for almost three years now and my chronic illnesses have worsened exponentially since then. I‚Äôm constantly feeling guilty for not being the same person I was when we started dating. I‚Äôm in the same slightly agoraphobic boat as you‚Äî I miss being able to go out and do things, but not being able to fully trust my body has made doing anything out of the house anxiety inducing for me. 

The wonderful thing about having an understanding and supportive partner is that they are constantly encouraging me to use my mobility aids and accommodate myself so I can live as fully as I could before my health declined. I really suggest having an open conversation with your partner about what you feel may be limiting your ability to go out and do things, and then trying to work together to come up with ways to make going out and doing things more accessible to you again. Mobility aids, a personal neck fan, pacing yourself, or scheduling breaks to rest during outings are all things that are helpful to me, but everyone‚Äôs different. 

I can‚Äôt speak for you, but being chronically ill tends to make me feel lonely and isolated. I know how hard it can be to figure out what accommodations work for you, especially if/when it starts to feel like a burden (I feel that way about myself sometimes). But I promise you‚Äî asking for what you need doesn‚Äôt make you a burden. It sounds like your partner is understanding, and if that‚Äôs the case then I have a feeling that she‚Äôd be more than willing to help you work through this. Because not only does it mean she gets to go out and do things with you again, but it means that the person she loves and cares for can live a fuller life again.

I‚Äôm homeless and staying with a friend, can‚Äôt afford therapy, and was just diagnosed with a life limiting disease that causes organ failure(cardiac amyloidosis). I have many other illnesses that are causing adult failure to thrive, i‚Äôm starting palliative care, and this traumatic event is making me want to stop all treatments. I was immensely struggling already and it‚Äôs the last straw. There were complications with my port placement (the dr muttered that it was the hardest time he's had with one as he was cutting me while I was awake, with a tent over my head silently sobbing) I was tied down and they operated with me awake and not completely numb, they ignored me patiently asking for numbing and to be put to sleep, saying that it was my fault I was still awake and that I should relax more, until I completely freaked out(yelled that it hurt and that we needed to stop)  and then they gave me way too much fentanyl and versed and knocked me out. I'm still bleeding today and have to go to the er tomorrow if I get worse. They did an extra cut and didn't stitch or glue it so it's causing issues I'm trying to get into trauma therapy to deal with everything.
I was patient and calm in adovocating for myself and i'm completely disgusted with the way I was treated. I asked to be put to sleep before this was even scheduled and was ignored and told no one‚Äôs ever needed to sleep in the schedulers 30 years working there. I told the nurses the day of I had anxiety and autism, aswell as the scheduler and everyone I made contact with. I told the anesthesiologist I wanted everyone to wait to start until I fell asleep. They were in a hurry because the dr didn‚Äôt understand what a J tube was and didn‚Äôt want to put me to sleep when my feeds had been running even though I had prior authorization, so they postponed my procedure. Once they finally started he rushed. This isn't the first time things like this has happened to me, and I hate how i'm treated as an autistic black woman. They blame my anxiety when they knew damn well they shouldn't have been doing what they were. I'm still bleeding and i'm not doing well but i'm too afraid to go back to the hospital.

"Need some words of comfort My mental health is pretty bad right now. Middle of last year, I was diagnosed with Celiacs and then in March I was diagnosed with Rheumatoid Arthritis and Ankylosing Spondylitis. It's all been a lot. Going gluten free has been harder than I realized and I am in constant pain because of AS. Not to mention the plethora of gastrointestinal symptoms. And fatigue.

I am trying to stay positive and do things that I am capable of. But it's so hard.

"Dad insults my ""illness"" I 17f have had stomach pain and chronic nausea for roughly ten years  

I tried to communicate to my parent when i was little but obviously as a child i simply couldnt explain and so i gave up and just dealt with it hid all sysmptoms 

Recently this last year i brought it back up and my mum was worried and has been helping to move investigation on 

I have had so many blood tests had low b12 and folic acid also vit d but unrelated.  Ive had endoscopy mild gastritis (not enough to cause sysmptoms according to gastroenterologist) had ct nothing apparent on that . 

Have been tried in a few different prazoles for stomach pain now on famotidine vitamin supps and ondansetron for nausea . 

But the other day my dad said something about how im on all these pills cus i have a shit diet and now i just want to crawl i a hole and never mention it again .

I dont think this is as simple as diet and it felt so demeaning.  

Sorry for the long ass post lol

Check out the gastritis subreddit. A lot of people in there are diagnosed with mild gastritis. PPIs, certain supplements, and a low acid diet can help if gastritis is the cause of your pain.

I say this as someone who also has gastritis. All three of those things in combination make the biggest difference for me. If you already have a healthy diet feel free to ignore this. Also if your dad felt like a diet change could help you, he did not go about it in a good way. 

I also don‚Äôt know if this is the time to say this. Being on PPIs for a long time messed me up. That doesn‚Äôt mean it will mess you up, just make sure to ask your doctor how long you can be on it.

I also feel like others think I‚Äôm a hypochondriac because I am constantly mentioning a new physical problem, but I swear! My body keeps inventing them faster than I can keep up. In the past year: migraines with auras so bad I got admitted, visual snow syndrome, sciatic pain to the point I need to bring a chair cushion around with me, pelvic floor issues, overactive bladder, nerve pain/neuropathy of hands and feet, frequent neck or muscle spasms, ocular hypertension, knee arthritis after a surgery, valve prolapse in my heart with frequent palpatations, irregular cycles, and SIBO symptoms (waiting on test results.)

"Ongoing symptoms with no concrete diagnosis? Hi everyone! I'm needing some advice surrounding my diagnosis/if anyone has anything similar that has happened/knows that this is. So I got Covid in 2020 and haven't recovered since - at this time i was living abroad in South Africa. I got diagnosed with POTS at the end of 2020 after suffering from fainting episodes and an erratic heart rate. I had body pain at the time but was told it's fibro. Going into 2021 I was somewhat doing alright but had constant stomach issues - my guess caused by my POTS. But then in 2022 I started to have more localized joint pain and eventually saw a rheumatologist who looked at my joints, saw they were incredibly swollen, and diagnosed me with psoriatric arthritis and ME/CFS as my fatigue and brain fog were really bad - however nothing came up on my blood work for inflemation markers or arthritis markers despite my joints being super swollen. During my flare ups for joint pain, my eye lids also swell up and become red and tender. I took pictures of all of this.  I tried a whole bunch of different meds for my arthritis (including methotrexate) but nothing seemed to really help. In 2024 I decided to get a second opinion from another doctor who said it couldn't be psoriatric arthritis because the medications would have worked if it was and said it could be non sero genitive arthritis - basically arthritis that causes inflammation but there's no blood markers. After this consultation, I was referred for a MRI due to hip issues (possibly caused by the arthritis but they say it's structural however it's gotten worse the more my arthritis as progressed). There was quite severe Bursitis on both hips and I needed to be referred to a hip specialist to do a key hole surgery. At the time, I was just about to move back to the UK so I decided not to pursue it further until I had settled down. I finally saw a rheumatologist here in the UK and was dismissed saying all of my symptoms were not connected but Coincidences. So again, my joint pain, hip issues, eye lids that swell when my joint pain is bad, and my fatigue is all not related even though they occur together because my blood work doesn't show anything. Recently I started wearing my fit but to bed and everyday I have my Heart rate variability score (which is between 0 to 100) be in the 30s - this score basically will tell you how ready you are to do exercise and a lower score means you need to recover - funny thing is i havent done any exercise or very little movement but need to recover - my guess is its due to whatever I have going on. I'm in a flare up at the moment and my fit bit is telling me to actively rest because I'm over doing my exercise. I have no idea what to do from here on out because whatever I have seems to be dismissed here but doctors but I don't know if this is some weird other mutation of something that we don't have blood testing for yet?

"A Rant about ""positivity"" Hey guys, ok why do people who don't have health issues tell us to 'just be more positive.' Our can't ignore our health issues and at least with me there are times where the limits it puts on me frustrates me. Not only that but most of the time it's pretty painful. 

I am not saying I let my health issues consume me and I am dark like a emo person of the 2000's but come one. I have a right to say look it hurts and I hate it without having to have a smile on my face. Also I think saying hey I am in pain today isn't being negative it's being honest. I am sure there have been multiple people here who have said they are fine and pushed themself when they weren't fine. 

I understand that people who care don't want to see us in pain but saying that is upsetting and almost makes it worse. If there was some way that we could get over this, we would.

I have really bad OCD and I obsess over my health so I definitely don‚Äôt need any new conditions to obsess over. I just need to feel less alone in my issues. 

For the past two years I‚Äôve been battling chronic nausea, dizziness, light headedness, stomach pains etc. almost every single day I go through episodes of feeling like I‚Äôm going to vomit and pass out seemingly out of no where with little to do to help expect just wait for it to hopefully pass. It‚Äôs completely derailed my life. I can rarely go out with my friends or family, struggle a lot at the gym, etc. On top of that I‚Äôve been out of college for a year and just now gotten the courage to get a job that‚Äôs perfect for my career goals but also very intense and I honestly may have to quit if my symptoms get in the way of my work.

I‚Äôve been to the doctor a million times gotten a ton of tests and at least on paper I‚Äôm pretty much completely healthy. Which I guess is good but also leave me no where with figuring out how to improve my condition.

"Hey, while you say you don't want any suggestions, and confirm that there's nothing physically wrong with you, have you spoken to someone that can help in determining if you ""have anxiety which can cause the symptoms"", or, if ""your symptoms are giving you anxiety""? Those are two different things, so knowing which one applies can perhaps give you a path you can go on. 
Your symptoms are real, and they can be isolating, but, now that you've found a good place to work at, are you sure that you don't have any options left other than considering quitting? Have you spoken to them about your issues? Is it so black or white that they can't accommodate your needs?

"Health anxiety is an entirely real thing, and a super reasonable one! We're all heard stories or have had bad experiences, it's kinda amazing we aren't all freaking out 24/7.

I have OCD and POTS, so from someone who has both reasonable and OCD anxiety get mixed up sometimes, I have advice...

Get organized. Keep data about your health all together... Track what you've been screened for... And then you choose to only look at it once a week, bi-weekly, monthly, etc. (it's it's really bad, you might have to start by saying, ""Only between 7:30-8 daily) And then you don't look at it other times except for tossing notes on the pile to organize later at the predetermined times.

OCD thrives on ""now, now, now"" compulsion, so when the OCD is about important stuff we need to anchor by laying down rules of engagement. Health OCD thought pops up, you tell yourself ""I'm supposed to worry about that Wednesday, not right now"".

A therapist would be much better at helping you develop a more you-specific plan, or you could customize the suggestion I offered... A patient advocate could be a way to ""hand off"" the responsibility, you just tell them symptoms and you let them handle taking to the doctors and making sure your needs and interests are looked after without making you feel like you need to be hypervigilant/research all the time/worrying about taking to the doctors ever so perfectly/etc.",comment_2,r/ChronicIllness,Health,,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChronicIllness/comments/1ktvvzz/looking_for_support/
"Your symptoms are real - anxiety can‚Äôt create the specific combination of nausea, dizziness, and stomach pain you‚Äôre describing. Even if stress plays a role, there‚Äôs likely an underlying physical cause.

You‚Äôre not gaslighting yourself. The fact that symptoms come ‚Äúout of nowhere‚Äù and significantly impact your function means this isn‚Äôt just stress. Stress doesn‚Äôt usually cause such consistent, predictable symptom patterns.

Some conditions take years to diagnose because they don‚Äôt show up on standard tests. Your experience of feeling like you might vomit/pass out suggests something specific is happening with your nervous system or blood pressure regulation.

You‚Äôre being incredibly strong taking on a new job while dealing with this. Don‚Äôt quit immediately - see if you can work with your employer on accommodations if needed.

"That sounds super frustrating, that's a big impact on your life!! 

I can relate to your situation, I have an anxiety disorder with OCD like symptoms (compulsions, thought spirals, ect). And man it's hard with health stuff. I have been on the side where it makes you think every little thing is a horrible problem and I have been on the side of where it makes you think no way it can be a problem since it's probably anxiety. Both suck and it's definitely not helped by doctors diminishing experiences due to having a mental health condition. 

Anyway, the thing that has helped me the most is learing that two things can be true at once. You can be having real physical symptoms and the mental illness can be making them worse or more noticeable. Either way it's still real and affecting you. Another thing is is that sometimes our bodies are whack and doctors Can't find an easy diagnosis so they say it's our mental illness. (Had that happen last week smh) 

For physical symptoms- maybe see if you can get a referral to an internal medicine doctor. It's a specialist so if there's something funky that those tests can't find maybe they can point you in the right direction. 

For mental health- honestly DBT has helped a LOT for me with a lot of the symptoms I get. Especially the distress tolerance, mindfulness, and wisemind parts. Medication has also changed my life for the better, it was like I used to be living life on hard mode and now it's a lot easier. But I also get that it's not for everyone and some people don't want to be on it. Therapy helps but also venting or talking to people helps a lot too if you have someone who has the space for it. Another therapy that has helped me is EMDR but that is more for trauma. 

Just day to day living- 
-i spoke to an occupational therapist recently about fatigue. She gave me some advice about doing the things I enjoy just in smaller and more manageable doses. So hanging out at my house with my friends for like an hour instead of going out all over town all day. Or instead of watching a big beefy TV show with a lot going on, watch something you have seen before or something less stimulating like an old tv show. She also reminded me to do body scans and take time to focus on more sensory things. When you are really stressed out or going through something medical or both your brain kinda goes crazy and you have to remind it to slow down and focus on your physical feelings. 
-meal prep on good days so you don't have to cook on bad ones, always have one or two freezer meals for backup.
-set a timer for cleaning, 5-10min, and do what you can in that time then be done or take a break. It's crazy how much you can do in that time.
- write. I hate that it works but it helps. Even if it's on your phone it feels good to get it out of your head. 

Sorry for the word vomit. But I hope some of this helps or at least makes you feel a little seen. I know how crappy it all is dealing with this stuff and I hope you find answers or at least something that helps get you back to where you want to be.",comment_4,r/ChronicIllness,Health,,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChronicIllness/comments/1ktvvzz/looking_for_support/

"Everything keeps coming back normal? 20 y/o female. I‚Äôve seen specialists for Dermatology, ENT, Ophthalmology, and Gastroenterology & the most I‚Äôve learned is that everything is fine but chronically inflamed. ANA, CMP, & all other blood tests pcp ordered also came back normal. I thought it might be a thyroid condition bc my mother has hypo, but two rounds of labs and an ultrasound showed nothing. Kept being told I needed to go to Neurology, did & had a 3T MRI and 2 MRAs done, but just found out those came back normal too. My Neuro told me it ‚Äúcould just be adhd‚Äù and insinuated I‚Äôm faking so I don‚Äôt exactly trust him to give me any reliable information or advice. I just don‚Äôt know where to go from here. 

My first symptoms appeared around July, 2023. I started having severe nausea and vomiting literally daily. I couldn‚Äôt eat anything but was somehow gaining (notable) weight. Until in Jan of 2024 when it reversed & I started rapidly losing weight (still unable to eat & dealing w/ the nausea & vomiting). Lost over 30lbs in the next six months. 

Around march the nausea & vomiting stopped entirely. Instead I began to rapidly develop a lot of new symptoms that quickly culminated in a (roughly) month long flare. The symptoms were severe hyperalgesia & allodynia, temperature dysregulation, raynauds, full body muscle & joint aches and pains- to the point I was using multiple pain patches at once, muscle seizing, severe morning headaches, malar rash (I‚Äôd been diagnosed w/ rosacea, but it was suddenly near-constant and unbearably warm & painful), hyperhidrosis suddenly got far worse, hair damaged & shedding like crazy, shortness of breath, general weakness- to the point lifting my blankets felt heavy, balance issues, severe fatigue, brain fog, and feeling it was hard to hold up my head. 

Since the flare ended different symptoms have come and gone, while others stayed consistent. It‚Äôs seemed like a kind of relapsing/remitting thing? The symptoms that‚Äôve stayed most consistently are my malar rash, fatigue, brain fog, short-term memory loss, hyperalgesia & allodynia, headaches, crepitus, muscle seizing/pain, and raynauds. I also developed new symptoms: randomly hot hands & feet (& now knees as well), frequent sinus infections, strained dry eyes, arthritis, aphasia-like speech problems, legs/knees suddenly wobbling, clumisiness- esp in my hands (frequently dropping small things, struggling to make precise hand movements), and numbness/ a feeling of disconnection (like bluetooth) in mostly my lower legs. Back in jan I had an instance where half my face went numb & tingly, I‚Äôve also had the tip of my nose a few times. That was what finally got me a referral to Neurology. 

I hoped I‚Äôd at least get *some* kind of information from the MRI and MRAs, but it seems I‚Äôm back at square one. Apt I feel totally lost as to what could be going on with me and why it‚Äôs not showing up on any tests. Has anyone here had similar symptoms/experiences?

"Hi hun. Some of your symptoms sound led suspiciously like mine - but not all of them.  I have MCTD. 

Based on the symptom pattern, this sounds like autoimmune connective tissue disease - specifically lupus (SLE) or maybe a mixed connective tissue disease (MCTD) but I would more strongly suggest SLE.

Key indicators:
	‚Ä¢	Malar rash (butterfly rash across cheeks)
	‚Ä¢	Raynaud‚Äôs phenomenon
	‚Ä¢	Multi-system inflammation
	‚Ä¢	Relapsing-remitting pattern
	‚Ä¢	Joint/muscle pain
	‚Ä¢	Neurological symptoms

The problem: Standard ANA tests miss about 5%-10% of lupus cases on average. You need:
	‚Ä¢	Anti-dsDNA antibodies
	‚Ä¢	Anti-Sm antibodies
	‚Ä¢	Complement levels (C3, C4)
	‚Ä¢	Anti-SSA/SSB antibodies
	‚Ä¢	Anti-RNP antibodies
Next steps:
	1.	Rheumatology referral (not neurology - that doc was wrong)
	2.	Request the specific antibody panel above
	3.	Ask about seronegative lupus (lupus with negative ANA)

The weight gain followed by rapid loss, plus chronic inflammation everywhere, screams autoimmune. Many rheumatologists will diagnose based on clinical presentation even with negative initial labs.

Why tests were ‚Äúnormal‚Äù: Early autoimmune disease often doesn‚Äôt show up on basic panels. The inflammation is there (as specialists confirmed) but the specific markers need targeted testing.

You need a rheumatologist who specializes in lupus/connective tissue diseases, not a general one.‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã",comment_3,r/ChronicIllness,Health,,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChronicIllness/comments/1ktvhov/everything_keeps_coming_back_normal/
"Would my mysterious dizziness affect my TTT? I have a weird dizziness situation that comes with throat and chest tightness and happens basically only when I lie down- the more I recline, the worse it gets. I take betahistine for it everyday, it was the only thing I figured out helps me and otherwise I wouldn't be able to sleep at all. 

I'm required to go through a TTT for dysautonomia and this is really important to me, but since dizziness is sometimes related to dysautonomia, even though this specific dizziness seems something of its own, do you guys think it would affect my TTT? Or would betahistine affect it at all?

"The dizziness getting worse when lying down is backwards - that‚Äôs not typical dysautonomia. Usually POTS/dysautonomia causes dizziness when standing up, not lying down.

Here are some maybes:
- Intracranial hypertension (increased pressure in skull)
- CSF leak (cerebrospinal fluid leak)
- Cardiac issue (blood backing up when horizontal)

Betahistine impact on TTT will have a minimal effect - it‚Äôs mainly for inner ear/vestibular issues and it won‚Äôt mask dysautonomia - TTT measures heart rate/BP response to position changes not dizziness itself. 

You might have two separate conditions - the lying-down dizziness AND dysautonomia.

i was in the car after getting my hair done and my mom did not like the expression on my face. i told her i was fine because it was a 170 dollar thing and i wanted to be grateful.

she kept on bugging me about it and after repeatingly telling her to stop she wouldn‚Äôt listen so i started to cry. then she started to make fun of my because i‚Äôm 17 years old and crying. as she‚Äôs making fun of my and bad mouthing me to herself i try asking her to stop making fun of me and if she could please try to my kind to me. but because i‚Äôm pretty much less that human my word means nothing.

"The problem is that, one way or another you can‚Äôt really boil these things down to specific characteristics akin to everyone who suffers these things (unlike what anyone with a Diagnostic Manual might tell you). 

Classically, we would consider any mental health disorder as any mental symptom that deeply disrupts the daily routine and basis of an individual, affecting either in an emotional, behavioral or mental way, or a combination of them. 
Depression is classically considered to be a profound state of negative feelings or hightened feelings , such as sadness, guilt or any others. For most people, even if this emotional/mental state can (and most likely will) disrupt their behavior, some other people can still have a depressive state and carry on with their normal routine, thus having what we could describe as a ‚Äúhigh functioning depression‚Äù, in which someone will present the classical mental state or feelings of a depressed person, but still being a functional individual carrying on through their lives, although most likely feeling miserable.

If you‚Äôre suspecting that either you or someone you know is depressed, it should be evaluated by a mental health profesional, due to how differently the symptoms appear depending on each individual person.

"Yes, individuals can certainly experience depression and still manage work, school, and daily activities... this situation often describes what people call ""high-functioning depression."" It isn't a formal clinical diagnosis, but it reflects a genuine experience.

Essentially, they are struggling internally, often quite significantly. However, they manage to continue with their responsibilities, sometimes due to a strong sense of duty, well-developed coping mechanisms, or because their symptoms, while distressing, don't completely halt their ability to function. It‚Äôs like they're trying to swim carrying extra weight... they might keep moving, but it demands considerable internal effort and leads to exhaustion.

Regarding not showing ""standard symptoms,"" they frequently do experience them internally ‚Äì such as persistent sadness, reduced energy, or a diminished interest in things ‚Äì but these may not be as apparent to others. They might become adept at concealing their feelings. Alternatively, the symptoms could be more chronic and persistent, as seen in Persistent Depressive Disorder (PDD), rather than an acute, severe episode. The outward ""functioning"" is present, but so is the depression and the internal struggle.

It remains a challenging condition. A mental health prof can help clarify what's happening and discuss management strategies. The presentation of depression isn't always obvious.

I really struggle with focusing on things, doing just about anything. I feel disabled and like I can't be successful at anything or do the things I need to do. Please help.",post,r/mentalillness,Health,4.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalillness/comments/1kudjmy/what_helped_your_adhd/
"How do I stop being this way? Hi. I‚Äôm someone who has a history of CSA, among other types of abuse.

I don‚Äôt know what to do with my life anymore besides face the inevitable end because living a normal life feels impossible.

I have extremely low self esteem, I‚Äôm not good looking, and I‚Äôm a bad person as well as a lazy one.

I was physically abusive to my little siblings as a child and teen, I was also a bad friend to all of my friends. I‚Äôm self absorbed and selfish, I hate it. I don‚Äôt know how to change. I‚Äôm behind all of my peers emotionally, intellectually, and mentally (ambition wise). I used to have anger issues and temper tantrums, and I was really mean to people I saw as ‚Äúbelow‚Äù me in highschool (people that no one liked, even though no one likes me) to have some sense of control. I used to be severely bullied mentally and physically by boys and girls.

I have mood swings and I don‚Äôt recognize myself in the mirror. I just don‚Äôt know where to go now, I want to be something but I‚Äôm so lazy that I can‚Äôt even get up to work on it. I used to love art but now I can‚Äôt bring myself to draw anything without comparing how behind I am to my friends. I‚Äôm not funny, or ambitious. I‚Äôm not smart either, I put relatively no effort into anything.

I refused to do chores as a teenager but I would spend all my parents money because I was selfish.

I don‚Äôt know what to do. I feel like I‚Äôm in a hole, like I‚Äôm trying to catch up to people in a race that isn‚Äôt even made for me. I feel disconnected from my peers and I hate myself. How do I change? I just want people to love and like me like they like everyone else, I‚Äôve never had a romantic partner, or a best friend, no one ever wants to get close to me or talk to me.

How do I stop being so awful and shallow? I just want to change and be good, I want to win award for my academics and awards like other people. I‚Äôve never done anything with my life and I want to change. Please help.",post,r/mentalillness,Health,2.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalillness/comments/1kukags/how_do_i_stop_being_this_way/
" I think it's extremely important to give yourself credit for how much you actually care. It may not always outwardly show, but it's clear that you're more aware than most, of how your actions have impacted others. I'm no therapist, so take it or leave it but it sounds, to me, like you spend an extraordinary amount of time and energy on beating yourself up for things that you've done (or haven't done). It doesn't sound like you lack a good heart or willingness to move forward but you live in a state of defense which is not only exhausting but it then carries over to the people around you.In my experience people (including myself) treat others as a projection of how they treat themselves. Best advice I can give, is to start by giving yourself a break. Acknowledge the fact that you clearly have a heart that you've built a tough exterior around to preserve, in a world that values shallowness over kindness. Be more mindful of how your inner dialogue sounds. It sounds corny and cliche, but be gentle and kind with yourself, and the rest will follow.",comment_1,r/mentalillness,Health,,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalillness/comments/1kukags/how_do_i_stop_being_this_way/

"What to do when you think you were misdiagnosed/have the wrong disorder or possibly have more than the disorder you have? To keep it short, simple and sweet. I‚Äôm 17 and when I was 8 I was diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder but I never really got treatment for it both medicine and therapy wise, and my parents relied on myself to try and ‚Äúget better‚Äù, so my whole life I was the one to try and better my disorder. I remember when I was 8 I was given medication and took it for only about a year, but I never really worked since my mom would give me less than the recommended dosage (I can‚Äôt remember my childhood life well and things are foggy so please take this with a grain of salt!) and I did go to therapy but my therapist was a lying bitch and would coerce me into telling her my secrets and then after ever session she would lock me outside of her office and tell my parents everything I had told her, including my secrets. My second therapist, one who I like better, told me what she did was wrong and at some point she did in fact break doctor-patient confidentiality. I don‚Äôt see my second therapist anymore. But over the years, ever since 2018, I always figured I was misdiagnosed or had more than one disorder. I would always bring it up to my parents and they‚Äôd brush it off. I remember in 2022 I got tested for autism but the guy who tested me instead retested me for GAD and told me I have GAD and not autism (wow what a fucking shocker! It‚Äôs almost like you didn‚Äôt test me for autism lmfao!) he also said he didn‚Äôt take ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know‚Äù for an answer and said that everybody does things for a reason, and he‚Äôd coerce me into stuff etc. but ever since 2024 many of my friends (online mainly) have told me they suspect I have some sort of schizophrenia or schizotypical/schizoaffective disorder or some sort of personality disorder (mainly bipolar or borderline), and before people say ‚Äúerm!! You can‚Äôt self diagnose because you fit the symptoms!!‚Äù I actually take a psych class now and we went over different disorders, from personality ones to ones that affect the nervous system etc, and I fit many. My one friend (irl this time) said that she personally believes that I don‚Äôt and that I probably just have GAD and I probably just experience symptoms that overlap with other disorders. For anybody‚Äôs interest, when I was younger I‚Äôd cry going to school, cry during school, cry coming home and cry at home and couldn‚Äôt be comforted, I‚Äôd vomit, have sleep paralysis, nightmares, night terrors, I would wet myself occasionally, even had suicidal thoughts, etc. then when middle school hit I began to have nightmares, flashbacks(?) (I don‚Äôt know if they are but basically I would do things that would remind me of the times I‚Äôd get severely bullied in school and I‚Äôd have to stop doing that thing and distract myself to feel better. I called them ‚Äúbad memories‚Äù frequently, and even brought it up to my mom before and she said that I‚Äôd grow out of them, but they still continue.), I also started horrible mood swings/splitting(?), i then began to experience auditory and visual hallucinations (which i still have to this day), I had trust issues (still do), and then I would have delusions, extreme paranoia, (i still have delusions and paranoia now), and today, in high school, my brain blocks out ‚Äúthe good memories‚Äù and all I can remember are the bad ones, I still get these flashbacks, I still have terrors, I still hallucinate, I still have paranoia, I have memory issues, and my mental health got so bad in 2024 that I was convinced I was dead/walking dead (Cotards syndrome, look it up if you wish, it‚Äôs hella sick in the since of ‚Äúit‚Äôs interesting that the brain can convince somebody it‚Äôs dead.‚Äù) but I recovered from it. I don‚Äôt trust the medical system because of my autism ‚Äúassessment‚Äù, I‚Äôm scared to bring things up with my parents, I always am. Even when I was younger I would be scared to bring things up to my parents, like I remember one time I told my mom I thought I had ADHD since my whole life I was fidgedy and struggled to focus in class and I still do to the point where a specialist teacher had to sit next to me to help me focus in class. I also have constant cat/wife eyes (mania) and I also experience sprouts of depression and mania. I remember in 2024 I went 3 months with being depressed and then after a few weeks in mania (and then my Cotards syndrome began), I felt numb and no emotions. Sometimes I still do. Words or actions or bullying don‚Äôt ‚Äúhurt‚Äù me anymore. It stings for a bit and then I just go tingly and numb. I always have a history of asking my online friends if I‚Äôm a bad person, or controversial. I also have had delusions that the government is out to get me. And also I kind of hate when I‚Äôm not ‚Äúright‚Äù and stuff like having to apologize. (probably because when I was younger, I would complain and tell my mom about me being severely bullied by my peers and teachers and she would commonly take my teachers side. The same teachers that would bully me. It‚Äôs no excuse really. I still accept the fact that in arguments I can be wrong and I also apologize to people when I hurt them emotionally or verbally, like when I accidentally say something rude to someone). I‚Äôm convinced that my GAD has either sprouted into something more major and severe or I have more than one disorder. My parents aren‚Äôt against mental health, I just don‚Äôt think they know how to properly deal with it?? I don‚Äôt think they expected to have a child who struggles with mental health and disorders and illnesses. They don‚Äôt even know about my symptoms/issues I‚Äôve experience in middle school to now, they only know about the stuff I experienced in elementary school. I don‚Äôt want to say anything to them, but I also don‚Äôt know that once I‚Äôm 18 and graduate high school, if I‚Äôll be able to afford a doctors appointment since no place seems to want to hire me for a job (I‚Äôm 17 and a junior in high school aka I‚Äôm fucked and doomed).

"How is severe paranoia developed? I'm talking about the type where you believe everyone around you is plotting against you, planning your demise. The type where you always look for subtleties in people's worlds and create arguments in your head justifying this world view.

"That is called persecutory paranoia, and there are many ways that it can develop in a person. The factors are emotional, behavioral, cognitive, environmental, social, and developmental. 

**The threatening appraisal of ambiguous information:** Is when someone is interpreting unclear situations as dangerous, increasing the likelihood of developing paranoia. 

**Low self esteem:** People with low self esteem view themselves negatively, which can make them believe others view them the way they view themselves, increasing the chances of persecutory delusions and paranoia. 

**Unjustafyable rapid judgment:** When poelpe jump to conclusions without thinking logically first they are at increased risk for becoming paranoid. 

**Anxiety:** People with anxiety can be afraid of everyday events, including people trying to harm them. 

**Persecutory delusions:** Some people with delusional disorder have persecutory delusions making them believe they are being targeted for harm, this closely related to persecutory paranoia, and they are often seen in each other. 

**Overactive dopamine levels in the mesolimbic system:** When the mesolymbic system has high levels of dopamine the brain may have an altered process of attributing significance to stimuli. Meaning individuals may perceive or react to stimuli that are not typically considered important or relevant. 

**Brain damage or dysfunction in prefrontal cortex:** The prefrontal cortex is responsible for viewing things logically and realistically, if it is not working properly peoples perception of reality can become distorted. 

**Trauma (especially during childhood):** Trauma can cause people to become distrustful and hypervigilant of others. Especially if the trauma was assault or abuse directed at them. 

**Substance abuse:** Substances, especially deliriants and stimulants, can cause hallucinations, psychosis, dissociative states, and schizophrenic symptoms. These can all lead to paranoia. 

**Mental illness:** Certain mental illnesses (especially psychotic, anxiety, schizophrenic spectrum, and personality disorders) can cause paranoia. 

The development of severe persecutory paranoia is likely a combination of many of these factors.",comment_1,r/mentalillness,Health,,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalillness/comments/1kuf6jw/how_is_severe_paranoia_developed/

"I don't know if I have a paraphilia This post mentions SH and grooming 


I think I should start saying that I'm actually a minor, I'm 16, lately I've been having a lot of thoughts a about pdphilia and I'm so fucking tired and scared, most than anything in the world I want to live as a normal person. It started like maybe 4 months ago but intensified lately, I don't what happened, but Everytime I see fucking child my mind goes ""you're probably a pedophile"" because I did experienced thoughts of it before, I hate them, I can't tolerate them, I don't know why I got them in first place, I Never tried to indulge in the thoughts, I avoid That type of content like the plague, Idc if it's fiction I'm just too scared to stare at it accidentally and that I will like it, my brain usually dont flashes me with disgusting images unless I'm thinking of it like in this moment but i would do anything to make them go away. 

It's not the first time that something like this happens to me, maybe 2 years ago I began to epxerience the same exact thoughts but with animals, I owned a cat for the first time because I really wanted one, I was maybe 14 almost to become 15, I remembered seeing a thread on Twitter about a girl who would abuse their dog for OF and it still haunts me, My brain flashed me with that kind of thoughts involuntarily and my body would unwillingly response, to the point that I would had to self harm repeatedly to make it go away, I don't have those thoughts anymore, my body has no response to them at all and never consumed any content related to it. 

I really hope this is some form of OCD or something like that, my mother got me into therapy for the self harm but I stopped going after she was asked to 400usd for an evaluation? Maybe diagnosis? I don't know she never told me, I want to be normal more than anything else in this world, I wanted to have kids and become a father but I just can't tolerate seeing children anymore because my brain goes to the same exact place

I was groomed when I was 7-13 by the same Dude, I don't think it affected me deeply but I think it's worthy to mention + I wouldn't considerate myself an age regressor but my brain sometimes just goes to an involuntary ""little space"", I do not engage in the actives regularly O willingly


I have diagnosed adhd and apparently my first and last psychologist asked me a bunch of questions that U normally get asked for autism or smth like that

"Having BPD doesn't require you to be on meds as treating BPD has more to do with learning how to feel, process and regulate emotions. That's typically done through a behavioral therapy called DBT (Dialectical Behavioral therapy). Sometimes it can be beneficial to be on a mood stabilizer due to the common occurrence with BPD of quick shifting emotions and moods, but it's not mandatory. The medication can help stabilize your mood so you're better able to take hold of therapy to also work on regulating your mood, and managing other symptoms of BPD. If several people have told you that they are concerned about you possibly having BPD, go and get evaluated. Either a psychologist or therapist can give that diagnosis and suggest the best treatment plan for that as it pertains to you. It's not a death sentence and it's not something that's bad, but if left untreated it can become worse or continue to or create issues with your sense of self, relationships, how you view things that happen in your life, etc. You can always go for an evaluation, but treatment and doing something about it if you really do have BPD will always be your choice.",comment_1,r/mentalillness,Health,,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalillness/comments/1kuihcx/i_think_i_have_bpd/

"Coworker behaviour? Hi, I'm at wits end and really looking for any insight, advice, help with this situation. I never thought I would encounter a situation like this but here it goes.

I work in a full remote job. There was a people shuffle at my job and a male coworker in his late 30's joined our team. He's married with a 1 year old daughter (I know this because at one point they seemed to be showing off their baby to try and elicit a reaction from me). Instantly I felt something really off about him, and my gut/nervous system felt it, even though I suffer from anxiety.

He instantly locked in on me, with this dead stare. He pinned my face during Microsoft team meetings Here's a list of things I shared as evidence and documented:

First week: Noticed unusual attention but ignored it and didn‚Äôt think much of it at first.

¬†Second week: At team meeting: During the middle of team meeting, this person changed their team background to match mine.

At informal team chat, received a phone call and left the team meeting. This person followed. I came back to my desk 10-15 minutes later and saw my colleagues were still in the chat. I re-joined and this person followed. This really spooked me - he followed me out then BACK IN an optional virtual meeting infront of everyone.

Second and third week:

* Noticed that this person is monitoring my MS teams status and schedule on daily or almost daily basis. Copies when I log on, log off, go away exactly. It seems they think log ons and offs, going away etc. are some type of morse code/signal, and they somehow sense I was aware which made it worse. yes I noticed because of my anxiety which turned into hyper awareness.
* Updated my privacy setting on outlook calendar. Right after I did this, this person then put a team status as ‚ÄúLunch, back at 1.45‚Äù

HR and management do not see how off this person is. They kept mentally escalating as the weeks went on with weird attention seeking, mimicking, and tracking. I sent them a warning message with my manager that they make me uncomfortable - they denied it and acted confused. They said there's not enough for harassment/inappropriate behaviour and only offered me a team move.

Since confronting them and my team move, they still haven't stopped tracking my ms teams and syncing with my log on and log offs. It seems they think I'm playing hard to get, or they feel entitled to my attention and keep doing weird, subtle, deniable things. I go from thinking they're delusion to thinking they know what they're doing. No behavioural issues came up when managers asked around about them which shocked me as it seems to be a practised pattern of behaviour. I think this person might suffer from autism,adhd, OCD, and NPD but is really good at masking around others but that's my best guess. I've never been the type to complain and have problems with others. I'm introverted, nice, and a hard worker. I've hid how much this has really affected me at work and remained calm.

I'll be fully honest this was been a very disturbing and distressing experience. I had to go on SSRI medication, therapy, and unpaid leave from work for months. I really feel I am sharing a workspace with my stalker. I don't know what else to do or why they're doing this.

"How to cope with homicidal ideation without visiting a therapist? I think about it 24/7. It may be the only thing on my mind along with my political opinions and things that make me angry. It causes me headaches that don't go away with pain killers too (or it may be something else, who knows). My life has absolutely no other meaning.

"I also have my own experience. I really have a deep vendetta with my family, for my own reasons.

Sometimes I get these intrusive thoughts where I would imagine how I would kill my mother, father, and others, brutally.

Though I'm not sure if those are counted as homicidal ideation, but my psychotherapist has helped me on how to speak to my mother to understand me, and at least it reduced my tendency significantly (I'm still cynical af, but I really couldn't bother).

So based on my experience, I think I would suggest considering a psychotherapist, if you have never been to assuming the case. But if you have, (cuz Imma be real) your therapist should've been more insightful and understanding towards you because (again, at least in my experience) a therapist should respect, be considerate and know how to help you besides keeping you happy. They should know what topics, advice and insights to give to their clients' based on their clients' history.

"How to escape a state where I've been doxxed since I was 18? I think Im still being stalked and I'm suspicious that I know who it is, and that they've been telling people not to date me and calling me a rapist online and on tinder as soon as I match, since 18.

I was 1 year out of high school when I liked a 17 year old who had graduated high school that day and was going to UT Arlington the following semester and she was a redhead.

Within 3 minutes we planned on living together as roommates and stuff because I was planning on going to UTA too the following semester and she and her mom turned on me because I got another message on tinder saying I like a 17 year old and I was a pedophile for it and that it was illegal (age of consent is 17 and she was literally moving out of her parents just like me over 15 miles away to college)

They all doxxed me online immediately and I got called a pedophile again by a 21 year old that I matched with minutes later and I have never been able to get a date since.

I never found out who they were and this happened in 2014 in Johnson county Texas.

I had never even had sex, I was a virgin, and a rape victim who was told I couldn't be with anyone anymore because of this and your county sickens me because of this.

"Knowing that I should be seeing a psychiatrist but refusing too I live in a country where poor mental health services are a know issue, I also grew up involved with a service similar to the child protection services in America and I've recently came of age. The services I was involved with have an adult program to where they help further education among other aspects of adult life too but it's mostly irrelevant to what I'm talking about now.

As I was coming out of state care I was asked by the agent I was currently assigned to attend a therapist of some sort for PTSD, depression and a stress disorder I've since forgotten the name of. I attended once but I don't like them and it's a bother to travel there too.

I should've mentioned this previously but despite being in care I never actually left my family as they fought hard to keep me staying with other family members and I would've returned home alot too, I was taken something like 30 times throughout my childhood and another thing is mental illness has a long running history in my family as close as my mother with DID, my father was never diagnosed with anything but he's been in and out of prison since he was 12 and both struggle with addiction (another thing that my family has history of)

My mother tried to get me to attend something too Which I also refused as my family has often fought for control over me and I've already been diagnosed with ASD and ADHD and any further diagnosis' could lead to me being deemed incapable of otherwise used against me, thought I believe my mother still has some guardianship over me. 

Despite all this I know that there is something wrong besides the PTSD and stress thing I avoided getting diagnosed. The PTSD was always apparent and I collapsed unconscious and tried to refuse treatment but they refused to leave me go without them (paramedics can have you arrested and brought to the hospital if you refuse to go with them in my country, you won't be charged unless you assault someone but I decided it wasn't worth the trouble as they didn't want to take me to the hospital and the doctor came to me) and was seen by two doctors and another pending who attributed it to stress and poor self care.

I've gotten to a point where I know I can't refuse treatment much longer as I know there's a serious underlying issue and I will soon lose the right to refuse treatment regardless but i still don't want to be diagnosed and treated as incompetent, incapable of have it affect my daily life or opportunities in any other way.

of course I'm not a doctor and I don't want to make assumptions or try and figure it out myself but especially recently I'm starting to believe I'm developing schizophrenia or it's related disorder that I can't remember the name of at the moment. It runs in my family and a relative asked me about it a few years ago and I laughed but I've had the early signs for a while now and it's getting worse. I've always had a stressful life too and in fairness had good reason to be paranoid but the last few months I've noticed my paranoid episodes seem more like the norm on top of hearing things that weren't said or seeing this out of the corner of my eye becoming daily rather than the normal happens to everyone occasionally kind of situation. I've always had issues with memory and impulse control (especially escalation to violence) due to brain damage I received when I was a child and had mostly recovered and I know being diagnosed already with ADHD that some symptoms overlap but regardless of all this I know I can't avoid facing it forever.

Any advice on how to navigate this without regretting it would be heavily appreciated as I can't find a way out and I don't need to scare my girlfriend who's already told my mother she's scared for me and I have siblings and other people too who I can't afford to fail. I've had a rough enough life and I'm trying to help give my siblings and the other people around me an easier time but I'm losing my grip as it is, the way my mother spoke to me the other night she seems to think I'm suicidal again and as I'm asking for advice and trying to give as much information I can I want to say I am not, it's not an option as much as I'd like an eternal nap I can't afford it and I wouldn't ever do that to my girlfriend.

"Anti Social (?) And at a Lose Self diagnosis, so take everything below with a grain of salt.

Last few months I've come to a realization. My whole life, I've felt empty, and as though feelings aren't quite effecting me right. I looked into muted emotional states and illnesses back during my hypochondriac phases, but always decided that I didn't fit the bill. Maybe I was right, maybe it was imposter syndrome, I don't know.

But, I've made the discovery in myself that I may be in some manner anti social. Not asocial, as in the personality disorder. Psychopathy, but not exactly. And the more I look around, the more alone I feel. The only person in my life willing/allowed to listen is my partner. But when I tell them I've never felt love properly (a simplification of the actual conversations) they get exceptionally concerned. So I have no one I feel safe talking to. Then I turn to the internet, and people talk about it as if it's not real, or just psychopath things. An evil thing.

What do I do? Where do I go? I can't find support groups from the emotionally muted, I can't talk to anyone in my life, and I'm so worried that if I go to a therapist they'll treat me like some dumb kid all over again. I don't even know if there are medications that help that sort of thing, not as though that can be suggested here anyways.

"Hydroxyzine changed my life For years, I‚Äôve had this awful combination of anxiety and physical symptoms that no one really took seriously. People think anxiety is just ‚Äúworrying too much.‚Äù For me, it was like my whole body was glitching. My skin would start burning‚Äînot like a sunburn, but like fire under the surface. And it would itch. So much. Like ants crawling all over me. Sometimes it got so bad I couldn‚Äôt sleep. Or think. Or exist without feeling like I was trapped in my own skin.

I‚Äôd scratch until I bled. I‚Äôd sit there shaking, trying not to cry, trying to distract myself with music or games or whatever. Nothing helped. And when I told doctors, they‚Äôd brush it off. ‚ÄúJust stress,‚Äù they said. ‚ÄúTry to relax.‚Äù

Cool. Thanks.

Then one doctor‚Äîjust one‚Äîactually listened and mentioned hydroxyzine. I‚Äôd never heard of it. I figured it‚Äôd be like all the other stuff that didn‚Äôt work. But I was so tired I said fine.

First time I took it, I didn‚Äôt feel ‚Äúbetter.‚Äù I didn‚Äôt feel anything, really. But then I noticed something weird: my skin wasn‚Äôt on fire. My thoughts weren‚Äôt racing. I didn‚Äôt feel like I was going to jump out of my body. I could just sit there. And breathe.

That was the first time in years that I felt calm.

It didn‚Äôt make everything perfect. I still have rough days. Sometimes I still get itchy or anxious. But hydroxyzine gave me relief. Real, physical relief. Not just in my brain, but in my body. And honestly, when you‚Äôre struggling every day, a little relief is everything.

So yeah. I‚Äôm not saying it‚Äôs a miracle drug or that it‚Äôll work for everyone. But for me? It helped. And I‚Äôm grateful for that.

Cooking, walking, leaving the house, or doing hobbies can become chores that aren't worthy of your time, or in some cases that you aren't worthy to pursue.

Just know, there are ways to get past it, and you sincerly would see someone about it. If I am right, and you continue doing as you have been, this could be your normal. Feeling like you do may overtake your normal life and make things far harder for you.

Again, I am not a professional, and I don't know your situation. All I can say is if you are at all worried about it, talk to a doctor. Even just a regular doctor can get you down the path to feeling like yourself again.",comment_1,r/mentalillness,Health,,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalillness/comments/1ktxsg8/im_i_lossing_my_mind/

"Anyone else with MDD? HOW DOES IT AFFECT YOU SOCIALLY AND MENTALLY? I got diagnosed with MDD back in 2024 and it has been very difficult trying to process and talk about. Thoughts that I can't help, like feeling bad for things I can't control or with others, and I can be an emotional wreck or not that emotional at all, I can be depressed whenever and I want to know if there is anyone who can relate and maybe say what has helped them or if it was difficult, I also have trouble staying focused on things sometimes when it stresses me out I tune it out and it's not healthy but I'm not sure how to help the issue.

"Did i just experience a mental episode of some kind? Hey all looking for advice as i think i may have just experienced some sort of mental attack, So basically i was just walking home from my girlfriends house (I didnt have any alcohol or drugs and i was there for about 40 mins staying outside the whole time this will be important later) when i got the weird compelling feeling to just start playing random music that i would never usually listen too one example being ""Merry go round of life"" i swear i would never listen to anything remotely similar to that normally but it just felt right for whatever reason.

As i continue walking i begin to feel slightly sick in my stomach like im gonna throw up but my house is a very short walk about 10 minutes if im taking my time. After that i began to get weird thoughts like the street light down the road was actually a creature, the cars had no one driving them and they were alive and gonna kill me, the trees were alive and gonna squish me and that houses were gonna be alive aswell. I keep walking being slightly confused as i begin to randomly start to giggle at literally thin air before not finding anything funny again. I couldn't help but stare at the cars as they would drive by i was just infatuated with them as they drove by. I kept walking having more and more weird thoughts like when i walked by a stop sign i thought it was alive and gonna fall on me on purpose and cut my head in half. Eventually as im getting closer and closer to my house everything starts getting weirder, i would see faces in the dark, i would randomly flinch at nothing, i would see figures etc. And now just a little bit before my house i can barely walk im stumbling and feel dizzy, i need to stand still for a little bit and just standing still staring at the cars go by feeling the cold breeze felt amazing, A car then drives by and parks a little bit up my street and im paranoid thinking different things like the car is alive and its trying to kill me or the person in the car is watching me or that a group of people are gonna kidnap me, so i eventually keep walking and this car is still sitting there and for some reason i begin to get mad, as i speed walk up the hill to this car holding my keys ready to approach the people, luckily they drove away i continued following for a little bit until getting outside my house and realizing its not worth it.

Finally, im outside my house and i begin to go up my walkway but at this point im too dizzy so i need to have a break so i just rest my head on the fence for a minute or two feeling like im gonna throw up before continuing to the stairwell that leads me to my garage where i just sit down on the stairs, im now paranoid seeing faces in the dark, i feel like im gonna throw up, my hands and legs are shaking and im starting to get hot but not like temperature hot as its a cold night the sort of heat you feel when your embarrassed. I then stand up and walk down the steps to the gate that leads to my garage and i pull out my keys and the paranoia just peeks as i turn and see the top of the stairwell is pitch black dark. Now for anyone else this wouldn't be scary at all but for whatever reason im so paranoid i think some demon or monster is about to come out from the darkness and kill me i keep imagining faces or dark figures as i struggle to put in my keys and i swear this was the scariest moment of my life even though nothing was actually happening, it was exactly like a horror movie where the main character is being chased and struggling to get the keys in the door and open the door (with the exception that nothing was acctually there for me). I get inside quickly shut the door feeling like i was mere moments away from something charging down the stairs, final weird thing that happens is i see a face in a shadow (which was just a clump of trash formed into a face) and as im opening my door i begin to get scared that my house is alive or i will go inside and it will just be pitch black darkness and something will happen not sure what i thought would happen but yeah.

I got inside about half a hour ago and im writing this down, im fine now just curios was this some sort of mental attack i endured? i mentioned earlier that i hadn't drunk any alcohol or taken any drugs so this wasn't some drug related episode. I have done this walk so many times it gets boring sometimes as i have done it so much, so it wasn't some fear of being in a new area. I thought it was a panic attack at first but after typing out everything that happened none of this sounds like a panic attack but i've never had one before so i would never know. Please anyone if you have any idea what i could have been experience and its cause please let me know!",post,r/mentalillness,Health,3.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalillness/comments/1ktjjl3/did_i_just_experience_a_mental_episode_of_some/

"Im trying to become more accepting of qeer people I'm still not sure if I'd consider myself gay, at least not yet. But I'm trying to stay open. I told my therapist about my homophobia, and they‚Äôve since stopped letting me attend church in person, though they still allow me to watch the sermons at home.


I'm friends with one queer person now, and he's interesting to me. We share similar interests, and gay people no longer feel like aliens. I honestly don‚Äôt know what I think about queer people anymore. Where I live, everyone hates them. There are conservative protests throughout the year. But my queer friend seems very healthy and high-functioning, even though he's gay.


For now, I still identify as homosexual and celibate, and I probably will be for a long time, maybe forever. But I don‚Äôt hate myself for it as much as I used to. I still hate myself a lot, just not quite as much.


I don‚Äôt think I really understand God. Why would He tell us not to be certain ways and then either make us that way or allow it? It feels like He hates us sometimes, like He's trying to find a reason to punish us. I hope that‚Äôs not true. Especially not for my friend. He‚Äôs a good person.

"I am not religious but I have read the bible and God says to love your neighbours (everyone) as yourself. Meaning you should love everyone including yourself unconditionally. 

The only sexual relationships that are forbidden in the bible are: parent-child, sister-brother, grandparent-grandchild, uncle-niece, aunt-nephew, and between half siblings and certain close in-laws.

There are different bibles and each ones are slightly off so I only quoted the ones that are the same in almost all Christian bibles. 

Queer people aren‚Äôt bad people they are just that, queer. People‚Äôs sexual orientation and sexual preferences are their own choice and it is between God and God only to decide if they are to be punished for that sin meaning you should not judge queer people for being queer and doing so is also a sin
‚ÄúJudge not, and you will not be judged.‚Äù (Matt. 7:1 and Luke 6:37)

"I have no idea. The bible has changed over time to say different things as the English language has evolved so no bible is 100% accurate of the original version. The bible doesn‚Äôt explicitly say anywhere that being queer is wrong BUT queer people use a flag called the ‚Äúpride‚Äù flag üè≥Ô∏è‚Äçüåà and God hates pride.

Be sure of this: They will not go unpunished.‚Äù

The bible is a twisted version of what it once was as is every bible. The words are those of men who we can‚Äôt actually trust. How do we know for certain that Jesus said what he said and did what he did? Can we trust their memory?

"A lotttt of Christians refer to Sodom and Gomorrah as the defining verse on homosexuality being wrong because God says (roughly) that ‚Äòman should not lie with man.‚Äô However, the Catholic Church is to blame for that lol. They changed a lot of things to fit their narrative hundreds of years ago. The original translations were not focused on it being between men, rather that it was pedophilic, rape, and gang rape at that (common practises in those towns at those times.) He‚Äôs not saying ‚Äúmen can‚Äôt love men‚Äù but rather ‚Äúmen can‚Äôt gang rape young boys‚Äù (again, roughly.) There are other verses I‚Äôm sure, and the typical marriage at structure always mentioned in the Bible is man/woman, but also the Bible says lots of things that we don‚Äôt hold fast to now. Source: am a Christian, have been highly educated at Christian schools my whole life, and am queer

Also, most queer people will tell you it‚Äôs not a choice to be the way they are. So then I‚Äôd ask: why would God create you, a person he loves, in a way that means they would inherently go to Hell? We all have the capability to sin, and we are born into a sinful world, but He made us in his image and why would he make us naturally in a way that condemns us? 

Living in the south is crazy (I know.) But please remember a lot of the capital C Church is created by humans. That‚Äôs not the same as Christianity or having a personal belief in God. 

I do not like to affiliate with the Church, but I am avidly a Christian. Personally, I don‚Äôt really care who people love. I have planks in my own eye and enough blame that I cannot throw stones.

"I need help. I dont know what to do at this point. Please read the whole thing Im a 18 yo boy. I have many mental sickness like OCD, BPD, depression, self harm disorder and maladaptive daydreaming. These problems began during the lockdown period . And I couldn't tell this to my family because I knew they wouldn't take it positively. (Im from a Asian country) But when my problems went out of control I finally shared this with my family. At first they didn't take it seriously. But when it began interfering in my academics they consulted a reputed psychiatrist of our country. I forgot to say that I ""was"" a very bright student. A topper in every sense. So when I couldn't study properly my parents took me to a psychiatrist. I told the psychiatrist many of my problems and He gave me medicines.  But my situation was so bad that I couldn't continue my studies anymore. I stopped going to school. I wasn't attending exam. And lastly I didn't sit for ky board exam in 2024. I dropped a year. And as time went by my family became very supportive and respected my decisions . I shared my problems with most of my friends but they weren't with me when i needed it badly. They just ignored me . As i wasn't a topper anymore they kept their distance with me. And then a girl came into my life. Lets assume her name is ""JC"" . So she was my ex batchmate. She knew me as an ideal student. Someone with a positive character and personality. Slowly slowly we got closer . She was very very enchantingly beautiful. Meanwhile I am a average looking guy. We used to share things about our daily lives. And finally at some point in 2024 I told her about my mental sickness . She took it positively.  She became more concerned for me. She was always there when I needed someone to talk to. She even helped me by giving her notes to me. Well she became my senior as I dropped a year. But she didn't let that make me feel lesser. As time went by I realized that I have other feelings for her. Feelings you don't feel for your friend . But feelings that you feel for someone with who you want to spend your rest of the life. But I waited for the Right moment.  I attended boards exam this year. And then I wrote a letter, a letter that contained a piece of my heart it contained feelings I never felt for anybody. I wrote poems haikus for her. And finally completed the letter and gave it to her. She texted me that she needs some time. So she gave me a reply 12 hours ago. She said that it's not possible. She had a relationship with a guy in 2023 but she got cheated on and she has decided to never share her heart with anyone. I didn't know about this. Because she didn't tell it to anybody. I was the first person to know about this. Then she told me she never saw me anything more than a friend. She didn't even give me any hint that she has any soft corner for me. And she said that as she didn't have any feelings for me and didn't give me any hint either, she shouldn't say sorry. I said yes and I apologized to her for writing that letter. I literally begged her to just forget about that letter and lets go back to how we were. Two silly human beings talking about random things. But she said it's not possible anymore. She said what's done can't be undone and we can't ignore the letter. So she said that she is still my friend but she wants to keep her distance from me. And told me if I needed any help I should reach to her. I said thanks. So basically we have to act like two strangers that don't know each other. 
Now everyone thinks that I've recovered from my mental sickness. But that's a lie . A big lie . I didn't share all my problems with my psychiatrist because I have some problems that are very very very disturbing and disgusting. If anyone hears about these problems of mine they would instantly think that im a sadist a sociopath that should be locked up in a mental asylum. And I think so too. I dont deserve to live in such a supportive family. I dont deserve them at all. I don't deserve to live in this society with other humans. Everyone who knows me think that I'm an ideal student, a positive character my juniors should look up to.  They feel sorry for me that I had to drop a year because of physical health ( only my family and some of my relatives know that I have mostly mental problems but in my country having mental problems mean you are crazy...) But they don't know that the ideal human being mask I wear is fake. Im a disgusting lowly person that fakes his whole character just to fit in this society.  My whole personality is fake and based on lies. Nobody except me knows these things. I shared most of my problems with my doctor, with my therapist. But medication isn't helping me. Counseling isn't doing me any good. Oh and i forgot to say many of my failures. When I was attending my first board exam in 5th grade I had jaundice and my result wasn't up to the mark for a topper. I attended an entrance exam for admission in one of the most reputed schools in our country run by the defense force of our country. I passed the written and the viva but was rejected in medical exam as my eyesight is terrible. And I dropped a year In the next board exam. It's like god gives me hope just to snatch it away from me. It feels like He likes to see me suffer.  I don't know for how long I can tolerate being a fake person wearing a mask. I can't commit s*i-cide because I dont have the balls to do so. I just wish I would die in an accident or someone would just murder me.

"Therapy is such a luxury I‚Äôm getting really tired of people telling me to ‚Äújust go to therapy‚Äù or to seek out professional help. I can‚Äôt afford it!!! It isn‚Äôt even just therapy that‚Äôs a luxury, most all mental health help is inaccessible and behind a pay-wall. I have severe and persistent mental health struggles and desperately need professional help. I agree that therapies are extremely important and needed in some cases, but so many of us have 0 access to it. It shocks me that people are even able to attend. Im in the USA and without insurance a single one hour long visit is around $300. With insurance my co pays are $80.

"Went to the ER for hemorrhoids after taking my daughter to school one morning. Had been uncomfortable for about a week. But this was debilitating. 

Couldn‚Äôt sit comfortably in the car, was in literal tears and felt like Satan was trying to birth himself from my asshole. My BP was through the roof for the pain. 

The nurse comes in and asks why I‚Äôm crying??? Then proceeds to confirm that my BP was really high and asks if ‚Äúit‚Äôs because of the pain‚Äù. 

I have to have my hemorrhoids surgically removed. This was on the 8th I went to the ER and they told me that. Went to my primary on the 9th for a referral to a colorectal Dr. 

Found a Dr I thought I liked, was supposed to be seen on the 19th. The office called and said my appointment had to be rescheduled to JUNE 5th. 

So I‚Äôm still in pain, beyond uncomfortable going through tubes of prep h. ER even prescribed these steroid suppositories which ended up making my pain worse and symptoms more inflamed. I never even asked for pain meds.

Now I‚Äôm switching between ibuprofen and a Tylenol/advik cocktail just to keep the pain at bay until the 5th. Have had some bad days where I wanted to go back to the ER because of the pain but didn‚Äôt want to be labeled a drug seeker, even though it‚Äôs not my fault I‚Äôm having to wait.

"Hello everyone! Hi, I'm one of those who have a mostly invisible disability. It's horrible. I have a lower back injury an adult inflicted on me when I was 13. Long story but... Residential schools can be worse than a prison. Autism didn't help.

I can walk, but what you will see is a large man sweating profusely, both seemingly and actually struggling from the effort of basic movement.

I can manage short outings into a store, but QUICKLY the pain starts building from its baseline roar.

I made it to the point of being able to keep myself afloat but every single day is an exercise in how much pain I can tolerate, which is also why I'm overweight. Any physical exercise that requires MOTION is actual torture. 

I've lived like that for the last 10 years. I got lucky. After the initial injury, it partially healed, just poorly. I should have been fully paralyzed, especially considering everything that happened after I was initially injured, as well as what never happened... 

I got 13 years of mostly normal motion. I got to explore nearly the whole country by highway as a trucker before I was 24. I was a cowboy from 17-19. I have a 12 year old daughter and had an 8 year marriage which ended in part due to my injury.

I lived my life early. I have few regrets, but I have no desire to grow old.

I lifted myself from worse than poverty by driving for Uber. I built as comfortable a life as I could. I live in a nice studio on the edge of a major city, supporting myself. I wish I could do more, but I'm happy with my life for the most part. 

I enjoy gaming and fishing, but I don't get to fish much anymore. I have 2 black cats, pixel and Bit, who are mostly what keeps me going these days.

"Dealing with anything for a decade is strenuous enough. Chronic pain is life altering! This is my experience, despite wording:You think differently because you have to learn so many coping mechanisms. Constantly having to overcompensate for the person we were before. I think we cross into the mental health march as we watch our peers, neighbors, family even, get diagnosed with cancer, have a gallbladder removed, a broken limb, etc. have treatment and recover. Yet there's not a solution to my many sources of pain, no matter what I do! Dr says swim, I swim. Says have implant, I get implant. Therapy, PT, OT, Diet, herbs, spiritual, I've tried it all! There's never a resolution. It doesn't end. No remission. No breaks. These are very hard for human beings to accept. Radical acceptance, tried that too! I believe it's a human condition to want to be ok again. When it's impossible to attain, that's when the depression and anxiety are living creatures inside of my being. This is my truth. I can't go back, therefore, I must go forward. Going forward doesn't feel good. Grief is a necessary thing we go through and it's not just once. It's over and over. I have to work closely with my psychologist because my days are often very dark. I have to figure out how to live with what I have left. Right now I need 3 more surgeries and I'm scared stiff!

"For those without children - what keeps you alive? Because I don't think I can go on any longer. My baby was born dead and my labour was mismanaged, resulting in chronic rectal and pelvic floor pain and bowel problems. It's been a year but I am still in so much pain daily. They told me I would make a full recovery but how is being in pain everyday a full recovery?

Every day is a major struggle. The type of pain (burny, stingy, stabby) and place on my body (anal, rectal, lower back) drives me insane. When I tell my gyno and GP they look at me cluelessly and tell me this is 'normal' because I have had surgery in that area.

How is it normal to go through this every day? To not be able to walk for 15 minutes or more without being in terrible pain, at the age of 33? I used to go on long hikes. I climbed rainbow mountain in Peru at 5000 meters above sea level just 2 years ago. I am supposed to be in my prime but I feel like my life has come to an end. I deeply, deeply regret my decision to have children.

I am at my wits end.

I cannot cope any longer. 

I don't want to end it but I don't feel like I can go on like this.

There's little reason to keep breathing. I do not have a child that needs me. To my husband I feel like a burden and I just want for him to be free and pursue his dream of having a family with another woman.

"How to land a work-from-home job that's disability-friendly ($70k - $120k/yr) I‚Äôve noticed a lot of posts recently by people looking for a job that fits the chronic disability lifestyle while also paying the bills. Some might claim that such a job does not exist, but I‚Äôm living proof that it does and is open to just about anyone.

My job is in tech sales where I earn a comfortable $250,000/yr. I started out 15 years ago as a young 20-something with zero experience. Most of the people who were hired with me had never gone to college (tech companies don‚Äôt always require a college degree).

I have muscular dystrophy, cervical kyphosis, tendonitis, multiple autoimmune disorders, and fibromyalgia. I work from home on my own chosen hours, no one babysits me, and I take sick days whenever I need. In tech, employees get treated like adults. I no longer deal with the stress of having to call out sick or endure a painful commute.

Tech sales jobs do not have to mean traditional ""sales"". There are plenty of supporting roles such as trainers, appointment setters, and operations that earn high wages and never sell a thing.¬†If you're thinking, ""This sounds too good to be true, what's the catch?,"" it's that people who work in tech have to actually be valuable to the company by producing great ideas and useful work. These companies treat people like adults because their employees are highly responsible and act like adults.

For those who are curious what a career path in tech could look like, I‚Äôll break down what tech sales is and you can realistically go from no experience to landing a work-from-home job in appx 4-8 weeks.

**What is tech sales and how is it disability-friendly?**

Tech sales involves selling tech products or services‚Äî aka software, hardware, SaaS (Software as a Service), etc. Most roles are remote and focus on problem-solving rather than physical labor.

A tech job prioritizes performance over presence ‚Äî success is measured by results (sales, leads, revenue), not by how many hours you sit at a desk. No one cares where you work from. If you want to work in bed all day, that's cool.

**The Sales Development Representative (SDR) Role**

SDR is the typical entry point into tech sales. People breaking into this role include 20-somethings who have never had a job before, middle-aged people looking for a career transition, older people who are nearing retirement. There can be a ton of diversity. The main job is to:

* Identify and reach out to potential customers (usually via email, calls, or LinkedIn)
* Qualify leads (ask questions to find out if they‚Äôre a good fit for the company‚Äôs product)
* Set up meetings for more senior sales reps to close the deal

SDRs generally earn $70-$120k in their first year and can be promoted into a variety of career paths. Some tech companies also award stock options, which can be worth hundreds of thousands to millions years down the line if the company goes public in an IPO. I've accumulated a lot of stock from the companies I've worked for over the years. Each time one goes public, I'm looking at receiving anywhere from $300k-$2.2M from the amount of equity they've given me. Going public takes time though, usually 10-20 yrs.

**How much experience do you need?**

None. I had no experience when I started out. Most companies will train you on the job. If you're wondering why most people don't pursue this career path, I've wondered the same. From what I've observed in my 15 years in the tech world, I believe it comes down to factors like fear of the unknown, not wanting to commit, or not wanting to apply the ambition it takes to be successful in tech. Things won't be handed to you working in tech ‚Äî you'll need to use your creativity and problem-solving skills every day to figure things out. I've always found it to be more interesting and engaging than a dull 9-5 for that reason.

**How to land a job offer**

To get hired in tech, you'll need to start prospecting and applying to jobs. Generally, that requires:

* A relevant resume
* A cover letter
* An optimized LinkedIn profile
* Minimal training to make yourself stand out in a saturated job market

There are several training programs out there that I've personally reviewed over the years just by signing off on reimbursement for employees I've managed. I'm not affiliated with any of these programs and don't want to post this as an endorsement, but can speak to which ones might be best depending on a person's situation. Feel free to message me if you'd like my opinion on training programs.

I hope I've provided a helpful overview of what it's like to work in tech sales. If you have any questions, feel free to reach out. I never mind helping out someone who's trying to build a life for themself.",post,r/ChronicPain,Health,9.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChronicPain/comments/1kur6ai/how_to_land_a_workfromhome_job_thats/

I‚Äôve had health issues my whole life. I don‚Äôt know that I‚Äôm the best person to determine whether those issues are minor or major. Depression and anxiety can do a number on ya, eh? Maybe I‚Äôll go into more detail in a comment, but I fear I‚Äôm already getting off track. 

When it has come to my bedding over the years, I‚Äôve been somewhat hobosexual in that I hadn‚Äôt ever bought my own bed‚ÄîI went from the bed my family bought when I was growing up, to whatever my GF at the time used/wanted.  It about 10 years back, I found myself in a situation where I was moving, needed a new mattress for the new place, and didn‚Äôt have an SO to lean on for advice or direction. 

So I bought a mattress that was purportedly a mix of coils and memory form, so soft you could sink into it. I loved it. Or at least, I thought I did. 

Since making that purchase, my pain management has gotten worse, actually it‚Äôs gotten on top of me (there‚Äôs other mitigating factors that I can better explain in a comment, I‚Äôm just struggling to keep my usual verbosity in check‚Ä¶ and clearly failing). And I don‚Äôt know what to do.

My question is basically: what do you sleep on? 

What works for you, if anything at all? Do you find a rigid mattress more relaxing‚Äîmore reliable‚Äîthan, say, a soft one? Maybe a particular brand that you switched to that magically solved your issue (at least, the *sleep* issue‚Ä¶)? Perhaps a suggestion not covered by my long-winded ramblings? Hell, if you find sleeping upside down in a damp cave fixed your sciatica, I very much wish to hear that! *Read* that, I guess‚Ä¶

Look, I have no delusions that a new bed is going to magically erase my pain or other underlying health issues. But I‚Äôve also spent the last 5 years isolating myself due to my health issues, both IRL and online, and I just‚Ä¶ I dunno. Wanted to try to reach out for once, I guess.

"Given I've got a pretty gnarly spine, I've been through a LOT of mattresses.....(and wasted a lot of money in the process). Indeed, I'd pretty much given up on finding a comfortable bed, and finally bought a basic, $800.00 ""semi-firm"" Serta, with no bells and whistles. 

Miracle of miracles, it's the best of the bunch, (including a 'hand-tied' model from Europe that cost over $6,000) giving me enough comfort that even on ""rough nights,"" I'm able to catch a few hours of sleep. 

I think the ""moral"" of this story boils down to simple good luck, as there really is no ""miracle"" bed that's going to suit everyone. Wishing you much luck in your search!",comment_2,r/ChronicPain,Health,,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChronicPain/comments/1kuinjo/what_do_you_all_do_for_sleep/
"On the oft chance that someone else with similar, if not the same, health issues has any suggestions, best practices, or simple wisdom: 

I was born with a host of digestive disorders. The same birth defect left me with a fused vertebrae in my neck (c6/c7), and that also led to a malformation of my shoulder sockets. My arm is easy to dislocate, much to my chagrin. Especially as I age. This all leaves me highly susceptible to migraines, which I have also dealt with all my life. 

I had a number of surgeries on my digestive tract to more readily replicate an otherwise normal functioning digestive system. These surgeries and the resultant scar tissue seem to be responsible for the bulk of my pain management. 

On top of that, in 2019 I was working with individuals that suffered from developmental and intellectual disabilities. A rather large autistic client wrenched my shoulder out of socket and displaced a few ribs when I failed to fix an issue that they had created. Since that day, my pain has skyrocketed, and my digestion came to a screeching halt. I have been unable to evacuate my bowels without medical assistance since then, which doesn‚Äôt help much with the pain management across my abdomen. Or make sleeping any easier. 

All of which led me to come here and scream in the dwindling hope that someone might be able to offer some guidance or direction.",comment_3,r/ChronicPain,Health,,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChronicPain/comments/1kuinjo/what_do_you_all_do_for_sleep/
"I have all kinds of spinal issues and sciatica with referred pain from every lumbar level. I also have greater trochanter bursitis on both sides. I‚Äôm a side sleeper so that definitely does not go well with the bursitis.

Several years ago, I found a mattress from Wayfair of all places. I believe it was $700, normally something like 3000. It was a hybrid memory foam and gel. Very firm overall with a soft topper. It works really well or at least as well as I can expect and better than any others I‚Äôve had.

Since I sleep on one side of the bed only, I have to turn the mattress around every couple of months to even out the distribution of where I‚Äôm lying.

I also change it up by sleeping on the couch now and then because my couch is ridiculously comfortable for my back issues but not every night if that makes sense

The other thing I learned some while back that helps with lower back issues when sleeping , at least if you sleep on your side,  is to lie on the side with knees bent but not bent a lot - maybe halfway. Then throw the top leg forward in front of the other leg by about a foot, rolling forward on the hip you‚Äôre lying on. This takes pressure off of the lower back. Then I put one of those roll pillows behind me. This prevents me from rolling back onto that hip.

I don‚Äôt know if any of these things will work for you, but they were the best things I found over all these years",comment_4,r/ChronicPain,Health,,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChronicPain/comments/1kuinjo/what_do_you_all_do_for_sleep/

"I have been using the same chain pharmacy for over a decade with zero issues getting my meds. All the techs know me. I'm like Norm from Cheers when I walk up ""AJ"" then they grab my meds. 

Last month I walked up and there was a note on the window that the store was closing as of June 3rd. This months PM appointment got switched to med pickup only, so I just have to pee in the bottle and they send my meds in, I don't see the Dr. I really wanted to see the Dr because I need to have them switch my meds to a different pharmacy and hopefully they will fill it. Next month they told me it's going to be the same just a med pickup and I had them write down that the meds need to be sent to pharmacy X. I'm having surgery July 1st and my PM Dr said to let her know when I get scheduled and she will adjust my meds to cover the post op pain,as that was one of the things that was making the surgeon uneasy about. Since I have been on oxy for last 10+ years, she is not sure how to treat the post op pain as I'm already on a higher dose and strength than they would normally prescribe. My PM Dr is amazing, she asked me ""tell me the truth how well and for how long do the meds actually help?"" I told her they take they edge off for about 2 hours. They take an hour to kick in then work for ~2, then wear off over the last hour. This is why I used to also have an ER med. She is going to keep me on the same strength but enough pills to take it every 2 hours and maybe try to add the ER back in. I have been drug tested every month for the last 10 years with a perfect record of compliance so she is more willing to help me. Now if I don't get to see the Dr before surgery I will have to wait for 2 weeks after surgery to see the Dr. I told them this and they are going to try to get me in to see the Dr before surgery.",comment_5,r/ChronicPain,Health,,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChronicPain/comments/1ku7e2d/getting_oxy_filled_impossible/

"Chronic stomach issues ? Hi!! I 21f am at a loss. 
Since August I have lost 40+ pounds (4‚Äô11)
I struggle with nausea that‚Äôs so intense I struggle to leave my house. I also get cramps that‚Äôs are also really intense but that doesn‚Äôt bother me as much. 
I have had multiple test, but no real answers. 


Around August I started getting really nauseous, with stomach cramps, feeling like I was about to get sick at any moment. This put me at high anxiety, so i chocked up the nausea to being due to anxiety. 

My pcp confirmed it was anxiety, but my therapist disagreed. I went back to my pcp due to intense belly pain. I went to the ER. 

At the ER I had a ct scan that showed inflammation of my intestines.

I followed up with a gi. 

My first gi, did a stool sample, blood test, and colonoscopy. Everything came back normal. And he said to call if anything changes, didn‚Äôt give me any ideas to change diets or anything. 

I went to my pcp for an unrelated issue, and he suggested I go back to a different gi.

My new gi was amazing. Did an allergy test, endoscopy, recommended diet changes, ext.

"Does anyone feel like their nervous system has become more sensitive due to chronic pain? I (26F) feel like my nervous system and/or my body in general has become more sensitive since I began to have daily chronic pain. 
Has anyone else noticed this about themselves?
Here‚Äôs some examples:
- despite having no fear of needles, I have vasovagal reactions about half the time I get blood drawn, which never happened before
- overall pain tolerance seems to have lowered
- I became very sensitive to alcohol since pain began
- more averse to strong smells
- cognitive dysfunction/ADHD symptoms 
- more sensitive to temperature changes

It seems like my body‚Äôs alarm system has become somewhat over reactive. From the little research I browsed, it seems like this isn‚Äôt unheard of in people who have chronic pain. I should point out that my pain is caused by structural issues and it‚Äôs not neuropathic in nature. I think it‚Äôs possible that some of it is now neuropathic due to the increased sensitivity from being stuck in pain, since it has gotten worse despite no visible changes on x-ray and MRI, but it‚Äôs at least mostly structural and musculoskeletal.

"today I decided to not try to go outside anymore Being outside in nature has always been incredibly important to me. I love experiencing the different seasons and going on hikes or just walks. I like bird watching, I like gardening, I like just sitting somewhere outside and reading a book.

All of that has not been possible for years now, with a brief break after I got an ostomy. But then things got worse than ever with a new medical condition and new chronic pain.  
I am trying EVERYTHING to getting it managed, I have been to countless doctors and specialists and I feel like I hit the jackpot with the most recent specialised clinic I scored an appointment at. But things are going very slow (public health insurance in europe) and I need to get my other medical conditions managed before they can actually pull out the big guns to help me. Which will take a year minimum if it works out at all.

Most of the time, I can't even play video games or read a book because of the pain. But the past weeks I could actually play some games again and even finished a puzzle. So I felt bold and tried to leave the house today. Took my walking cane, took some meds and didn't even make it far past the door. I am now in a flare that will most likely become horrific in a few hours. It's one of countless occasions in a row where I feel confident enough to leave the house, carefully listen to my body and everything and it's a complete disaster.

It's a beautiful warm sunny day today I would have loved to experience and when I got back through my door I just broke down crying.  
I tried for a year now and everytime it's just desperation and sadness. I feel a bit stupid for still trying even though it has NEVER gone well.

And I think for now, I have to stop trying. There comes a deep grief with it but also some relief. I put a lot of hope into these trials and with the hope comes a ton of pressure. I want to hike again, I want to work again, I want to have a home with at least a small garden or balcony. And it's hard letting all of that go. I am still trying everything I can do have a better quality of life, I won't give up until I have squeezed everything out of the medical system I can.

But there is a huge chance that this is just my life and I think I am overdue with accepting that. I am putting myself through so much pain by trying to force my body to do things it just can't do.

Would it be possible to just Be Outside, in a comfy chair or lounger, with no expectation for walking, exercising, or gardening? Nature and sunshine help boost our immune systems and for me, my mental health is better when I get time outdoors every day.

"  
Thank you for your kind words, they are very much appreciated <3 This sounds so whiny, I am sorry lol but..   
  
I live in a big city in a tiny under-the-roof flat and if I want to be in nature, I need to travel quite the distance. As I said in the post, i tried a lot. I don't own a car and I can't drive in my current state, walking is downright impossible (as I accepted today) and being driven by someone also didn't work out because we had to turn around everytime before we could reach our destination. I have a bus stop in front of my door but going somewhere by public transport is insanely scary because I never know if I will be able to make my way back or not.   
A wheelchair would be another option but I'd have to move because the house isn't build so I can put it anywhere downstairs. And honestly, my pain is what it makes everything so bad so the wheelchair would probably not really help with that. 

My windows are all high and small and roof windows, so all I see through them is the sky. I made my home as cozy as possible, with plants and colors that remind me of the outdoors. Also have calendars which state what plants are in season. That all helps a lot! 

I would like to move somewhere else someday but the rent here is super cheap, all my doctors are nearby and I have a good professional support network of case workers and carers nearby. So I need to be a bit better before I can consider moving out

"Why not order a few houseplants online and bring nature to you? My username gives my hobby away but I grow orchids. They have their challenges but year round something is always growing and blooming. The room I keep them in also has a sofa so I can lie down with them nearby. 

I don‚Äôt assume everyone wants to grow orchids but I have never lived without at least one houseplant. Unless you do not have access to natural light at all (there are cheap grow lights for that) you can keep a little nature around. 

I can completely relate to how you feel. I live in a suburb and my husband keeps our garden and I don‚Äôt have the strength to walk out my back door to see it.

"Letter to my district congressmen and the governor Copy it and send it to your district congress offices and state legislators.  Make any changes you want. This letter is public domain. 

Subject:** Urgent: Unintended Consequences of Opioid Regulations¬†
¬†
Saturday, May 24, 2025

Dear North Carolina Governor Josh Stein, Congressman Chuck Edwards, District 11, and Senator Thom Tillis,¬†District 11, Director Stephanie Young, Charles George VAMC:
¬†
I am writing to express serious concern about the unintended consequences of opioid-related lawsuits and regulations. While addressing opioid misuse is important, the aggressive legal actions against pharmacies have **severely restricted access** to vital pain medications for patients with legitimate medical needs‚Äîespecially for those living in **North Carolina‚Äôs District 11**.¬†
¬†
Pharmacies are **not law enforcement agencies**, yet they are being forced into a position where they fear legal repercussions for fulfilling prescriptions written by licensed doctors. As a result, patients suffering from **chronic pain, post-surgical recovery, and severe conditions are left without options**, enduring unnecessary suffering due to supply shortages and extreme restrictions. Many pharmacies in North Carolina no longer have **essential medications like Morphine or Clonazepam** in stock, forcing patients into painful, uncertain situations.¬†
¬†
Meanwhile, **alcohol and tobacco remain widely accessible**, despite their well-documented health risks. This inconsistency in policy is glaring. If the goal is truly **public health**, life-improving medications must remain accessible to those who need them‚Äîwithout **bureaucratic interference**, **overreaching law enforcement**, or **fear-driven policies**. The justice system must not be **weaponized** to serve political agendas rather than medical necessity.¬†
¬†
I urge you to **reassess opioid regulations** and ensure that policies are **balanced and science-based**‚Äîprotecting both public health and individual rights. The current approach fails to account for **scientific methodology in data collection**‚Äîcritical factors such as **BAC levels, prescription history**, and individual medical circumstances are often ignored, leading to flawed conclusions. Without reliable data, restrictions are **harming patients** rather than addressing the root causes of addiction.¬†
¬†
Personally, these restrictions have been devastating. As a **100% Disabled U.S. Navy Veteran**, I relied on the **North Carolina Veterans Hospitals in Asheville and Durham** for treatment for over **ten years**. Now, due to misguided policies and unfounded suspicion surrounding pain medication by and Benzodiazepines, I am forced to **pay out-of-pocket** for private health insurance, copays, prescriptions, and doctor visits‚Äîdespite years of **clean urine tests** proving responsible medication use.¬†
¬†
This issue is bigger than just regulations‚Äîit‚Äôs about **fair treatment, access to care, and the fundamental rights of patients**. I urge all **commissioned law enforcement officers and attorneys** to read discussions in forums like **Reddit‚Äôs Chronic Pain community** to understand the devastating effects of these policies firsthand.¬†
¬†
I look forward to your response and a commitment to **correcting these injustices**.¬†
¬†
**Sincerely,**",post,r/ChronicPain,Health,3.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChronicPain/comments/1kunenc/letter_to_my_district_congressmen_and_the_governor/

"I thought most of the big pharmacies have already settled the lawsuits. No way in hell will politicians stop their lawsuits. They want the money. And to be fair there was abuse.

"Josh Stein the Democratic Governor was the NCAG and on his brag page he talked about taking money from pharmacies for their involvement in the opioid crisis. Going after pharmacies and blaming them was a misuse of justice, they fill prescriptions written by doctors. If the pharmacist is as selling opioids out the back door then that is illegal. Pharmacies hired crappy defense attorneys and had deep pockets so ripping them off using the legal system only proves how broken our court system is in this country.

"Seeking advice: Tailbone pain months after fall from a horse A few months ago, I fell off a horse and landed on my butt. Since then, I‚Äôve been feeling pain in my tailbone area‚Äîbut only under very specific conditions. I don‚Äôt feel any pain while sitting normally, walking, running, or even riding again. However, I do feel discomfort or a dull pain internally when I‚Äôm sitting and engage my pelvic floor muscles.

I also don‚Äôt feel any pain when pressing on the tailbone externally or putting pressure on the area from the outside / by touching tailbone area.

The discomfort seems to lessen when I stay active or do stretching exercises regularly, but the discomfort /pain hasn't been completely gone since then.

I didn‚Äôt see a doctor right after the fall because I assumed the pain was just normal bruising from the impact and that it would go away on its own with time. While it has improved somewhat, I still feel this specific pain.

Has anyone experienced something similar or can give any advice?

I know the old school way used to be to tough it out (it's been years so I hope it's different now) but so many of my health issues now are related to falls in my teens that went untreated.

I'm thinking of trying physical therapy first to see if massage or soft tissue work /muscles connected to the tailbone/ coccyx area helps. From what I‚Äôve read, it seems possible that the muscles might have pulled or tightened around the tailbone, which could explain why the pain is so specific. That would actually be a bit of a relief, since it‚Äôs something that can usually be treated fairly quickly and tends to respond well to therapy. And if that doesn't do the trick, then I‚Äôll definitely go see a doctor just as you've suggested.

I'm new to horse riding, actually still learning how to ride, and that was my first fall. But as you said...where I ride, it is that kind of vibe, that falling is just part of the experience for every rider at some point and it's something you learn over time ‚Äî how to fall more safely when it happens. Like no big deal at all. But from this experience I don't take it so lightly, I think you can really get hurt.",comment_2,r/ChronicPain,Health,,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChronicPain/comments/1kulmsb/seeking_advice_tailbone_pain_months_after_fall/

And protect yourself. Of course everything in life has associated risks, but generally speaking horse people tend to minimize those.

"Yeah OP if you are a new rider and this was first fall definitely get it checked. Yes we do sort of learn to fall over the years but take it from me you can still get caught off guard by stupid mistakes, especially if you jump. Imaging will give you peace of mind and if it's clear definitely try soft tissue/muscle treatment. 

Another aspect of physical therapy you may want to look into is your pelvic floor. Try the others first but if that doesn't work someone who specializes in that area may see or feel something different but that can be more invasive. 

I second the safety equipment. I used to ride with ""do as I say not as I do"" kind of mentality. None of my students ever got sent to the hospital but me...

"Complex treatment for complex chronic pain Hello, I'm 32 years old, male, with moderate-severe scoliosis, thoracic hyperesthesia, Pectus Excavatum, L5-S1 herniation (waiting for surgery because of how severe it's now), MPS, others. I have been trying to make my life as bearable as possible for quite some time, seeking to be as comfortable as possible in life (being comfortable in the context of chronic pain, in my case back pain), I suppose like everyone else here.
I have gone through all the WHO analgesia steps until reaching my current treatment. Unfortunately, and despite having tried many times, I am unable to tolerate gabapentinoids, especially Gabapentin. I've been taking Oxycodone/Naloxone (Targin/Targinact) for a year, and I've been on the total daily dose of 60-70 mg of Oxycodone for the past two months. Every few months, my doctor switches me to MST Continus (MS Contin), and by doing that and taking ""short"" tolerance breaks when the pain allows, we've gotten more comfortable with tolerance. 
Although I'm much better than before, there are some pains that don't go away with that type of treatment. The times I took gabapentinoids, I admit they relieved those pains that opioids don't, but Gabapentin caused me very intense depressive symptoms and dark thoughts, among others. I've tried it many times. I told my doctor that I need more relief, and she suggested combining a slightly lower dose of the opioid than my current one with low-dose Pregabalin.  I replied that I should discuss this with my psychiatrist since I'm taking Elvanse/Vyvanse for ADHD and Asperger's, and it's working very well for that (I'm also finding some pain relief in that med). I don't want to take Pregabalin and have it ruin my treatment.
I'd like to know what experiences those of you who have taken or are taking Pregabalin with an opioid have had.
I'd also like to know if there's anyone with chronic pain who also takes Elvanse/Vyvanse for ADHD or Asperger's, if Pregabalin reduced the effectiveness of the stimulant and if it reduced their pain. 
I'd also like to ask if they've noticed greater effectiveness in pain relief with the combination of Elvanse/Vyvanse + MS Contin than with another opioid.
Thank you in advance.",post,r/ChronicPain,Health,2.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChronicPain/comments/1kudgd3/complex_treatment_for_complex_chronic_pain/
"I like your doc. Thats smart to rotate the MSContin/Targin. I would lesten to anything they tell you. Nothing wrong with consulting your psychiatrist first, and you got to tell them about any medication changes. But they may not see things from the perspective of pain management, its not their thing. 

Pregablin and gabapentin are really similar. The do the same thing, they just go about it in different ways. I'd try the pregablin, maybe on an as needed basis, since this sounds like a different aspect of the pain. The main complaint about pregablin is that it usually causes weight gain . About 35 pounds in most cases, so its not insignificant.

Its hard for me to get in to personal opinions on these drugs as I have never found a gabapentinoid helpful. When I get nerve pain, I usually set the TENS unit after it. If you had PT, thats the prickly electrical ""massager"" they may have used on you. If that doesnt  bring anything to mind, Im not sure if you psychiatrist would know what a TENS unit is, but your pain doc sure would. Ask, as they can be quite handy little devices to have around for nerve pain. With no drug interactions whatsoever.  

A stimulant and an opioid can both be effective for pain and used together. Did I mention I like your doctor? Usually the stimulant helps more with acute sort of pain. Part of the fight or flight response too, I think. Im just amazed at what the body does. Stimulants reduce pain sensitivity, thats why your body dumps adrenaline when youre scared (or injured), so you can ""fight or flight"" better. Feeling less pain would be a helpful thing if you engaged in either.

Im not sure what your psychiatrist might say if you asked about the combo of Targin/Vyvanse providing improved pain relief, but it should make perfect sense to the doc treating your pain. Did I mention I like your doc? They seem to know their way around these drugs without freaking out about Zombie drug addicts....",comment_1,r/ChronicPain,Health,,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChronicPain/comments/1kudgd3/complex_treatment_for_complex_chronic_pain/

My actual psych. is someone who knows a lot about psych meds, and my primary doc, yes is great, I like all of them, except the one from Pain Management (Meds were prescribed by primary attention).

When Buprenorphine Doesn‚Äôt Work for Pain
Unfortunately, buprenorphine doesn‚Äôt always work for pain in everyone. Research suggests that a genetic variant, the N40D variant, may be responsible for those patients who do not respond to buprenorphine for pain and need rotation to another opioid in order to achieve adequate pain control. The N40D variant is the most common MOR receptor variant, an A > G substitution at nucleotide 118, and is present in 10-50% of the population and the efficacy of buprenorphine associated with this variant may be reduced by >50%.
A decrease in buprenorphine efficacy arising from the N40D variant could be a contributing factor for the lack of response of some individuals to buprenorphine maintenance therapy and may predict a significantly inadequate or inappropriate analgesic response in a large proportion of the population.

Im also on multiple other medications (antidepressants, PPIs, Antinauseas, Antipsychotics) But I've been on them for many years, and never once abused them or taken them out of schedule.

when i have terrible pain, that literally makes me bedridden, i try to disconnect my mind from my body. the pain we feel is a result of something in our body, but when im able to disconnect my mind and realize the pain is just a reaction, it definitely dulls down! like a placebo :) good luck my friend, it will turn out better as long as you think it will.",comment_3,r/ChronicPain,Health,,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChronicPain/comments/1ktr3a7/my_life_sucks_like_actually_so_bad/

Did you get these same results from the 7 day trial, or did the trial provide more relief than what you got from the actual implant?

"What is it with some people's need to compete with their pain? This is a very long vent/rant about two people in my chronic pain group who drive me crazy and are making me like not even enjoy group anymore. Can anyone else relate?

Ive struggled with chronic pain for years, which I assume all of you have also, or know someone who has. And I think overall people who deal with chronic pain have so much empathy - we know the Healthcare system actually cant help everyone the way people think it can, we know what its like to be mistreated or dismissed, and we know what its like to have to put on a fake smile when we're suffering. We know how hard it is to be in pain and *never really get better*. Ive met some of the most sympathetic and wonderful people who unfortunately suffer from health issues.

But there are a couple people in my local chronic pain support group who literally drive me crazy and it almost makes me not want to participate in group anymore. Im there to connect with people who understand how hard things can be, to give each other support, listen to their stories, share our life hacks/tips/low effort cooking, etc... As someone who has lost a lot of friends and social life bc of health issues I really have gotten a lot out of this support group.

Well, there's one woman, A, there who ALWAYS has to say that she has ""the suicide disease"". She's said that her pain is scientifically proven to be ten times worse than kidney stones. Its fifty times worse than medicated childbirth. It's worse than bone cancer. Like EVERY time she shares a story she starts with, ""My disease is so severe that its one of the worst pains known to man. I wake up every day at a ten out of ten pain. So I was at the doctors, and..."" and then she'll go into her story. It's so annoying to me because like everyone there is dealing with different things. There are cancer sufferers there, there are people with kidney stones, there is a woman with a botched gastric bypass surgery... We dont sit there and decide who has it ""worst"". Who am I to decide if gallstone pain is worse than broken ankle pain is worse than migraine pain, you know? I really feel like we should focus on giving support and advice to the PERSON WHO IS SHARING and not spend our time trying to convince people that we actually have it the worst.

There's another person, R,  there who tends to say ""I *wish* that was my problem."" Like one of our group members, Ill call her B, has some disease that makes them very very prone to kidney stones, they've had them in the past and if the stones are too big or theres too many, they have to be hospitalized for a procedure. So B was sharing that she had to be hospitalized again recently for an irregularly shaped (or maybe just large?) kidney stones and have a procedure because it couldn't pass on its own. We're all familiar with B and know this something shes gone through before and so everyone was kind of like ""Not again B, you had been doing so great! Im so sorry!"" and asking about how she was feeling now, new treatments etc. And then this other woman, R, says ""I *wish* kidney stones were my problem . At least with a kidney stone, the doctors in the ER see it on your chart and take it seriously, they give you pain meds - "" and R just went off on this tangent. R has also said this to a cancer patient. ""I *wish* cancer was my problem because then if you have cancer people try to help you and understand how bad it is.""

WHAT. It made me so mad. I dont have a kidney disease or cancer but how is ""I wish I had what you had"" helpful or compassionate AT ALL. R has been coming to this group for ages like as long as I've been there but A (the ""suicide disease off the charts pain"") is new and I think they're friends. Most of the people in that group are so kind and gentle and they're just suffering and they kind of let R & A just steamroll over them because they dont want to be mean and inconsiderate. I guess Im kind of a scaredy cat because I dont want to start a fight or look like an asshole either so last time when Beth was sharing her kidney issues I just kind of redirected back to her ""B, you're still sharing, right? Okay, so what did your new kidney doctor say once you got admitted?"" to try to put the focus back on her where it should be, but I didn't want to say anything directly about R being really inconsiderate. 

Idk am I just overreacting? It's just a local chronic pain support group that has an online group chat and then whoever is well enough to visit meets up at the library or panera bread its not like a big organized thing where there's rules and an administrator or anything. But its almost not even fun for me to go anymore to just hear A try to one-up everyone with her 100/10 pain, and hear R tell people ""I wish I had what you had"" and make it about her. I guess Im just being dramatic and shouldn't criticize how another chronic pain patient handles their disease but I just want to be like ""Come on, we ALL have chronic pain, we ALL are trying to make it through the day, we ALL are here trying to support each other & talk to people who get it and YOU are the only one who is trying to act like this is a competition!""",post,r/ChronicPain,Health,25.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChronicPain/comments/1kttmnb/what_is_it_with_some_peoples_need_to_compete_with/

"Ugh, that's the worst. She's miserable, and it sounds like she cant deal with the idea that YOURE in pain also (because she has to be the worst/be owed the most sympathy!) but she also doesn't want to you to get any better because you aren't allowed to be any happier than her either??

People underestimate how absolutely exhausting and stressful it is to deal with that type of person in your personal life. My ex was like that - I'd literally be discharged from the hospital and ask him if he could please put my laundry in the washer for me, something small, and he'd snap ""You know, other people have problems too!"" I'd say, Can you pick up some soups from me at the store because the doctor wants me to eat soft/liquid type foods for a while - ""Not everything is about you! All you think about is what *YOU* want people to do for you, not what YOU can do for others.""

It wears you down, it makes you feel guilty. Im sorry your own mother is like that to you - its like gaslighting in a way because she wants you to question ""Wait, am I just lazy? Maybe Im not in as much pain as I think I am....Am I being weak?"" But you are NOT. Chronic pain and chronic illness are SO hard to deal with and thats not even adding into the mental & stressful burden of it.

Im so lucky in the sense that I have the best family on the planet. I just got DC from the hospital recently and my dad said ""Im gonna get the kids up and off to school for you, dont even think about it - you dont even have to roll over if you dont want to."" I said, Well, what are they having for lunch tomorrow and he goes ""Ive got everything handled. Your mom is giving the kids baths, we'll handle homework, lunches - you worry about getting a good night's sleep, we will handle everything else."" My parents and my sister 1000% love and believe me and tell me all the time ""If there's anything that will help you even a little, tell us. You want a milkshake? You need something from the pharmacy? Oh, the insurance company keeps calling you, give me their number."" They cant help my physical health - they cant fix things with the doctor or the insurance and they cant make the meds work and make me feel better - but they do everything they possibly can to help with that MENTAL, stressful burden and I feel so lucky. I wish your mother was like that for you!

"I just don't know what to do anymore. I'm 25, about to be 26. At this time last year, I came down with what I thought was a nasty stomach bug. My heart rate was high, my insides felt like they were on fire. I went to an ER and they basically told me to just rest and deal with it. Then my chest started to hurt. badly. Back to the ER I go, bo lo and behold, no heart issues. Then I start getting this pain under my ribs that gets worse when I eat, and my back is killing me. More tests, more nothing. As the year since then has gone on, I just continue to deteriorate. Ive been seen by a cardiologist, a gastroenterologist, and had loads of tests done, with everything coming back normal. Meanwhile, I've lost 30 pounds because the only sort of repreive I get from the excrutiating gut pain is the lesser pain of starving myself. 

At the start if this, I weighed 140 lbs, now I weigh 110 and i keep losing weight faster. I'm also 6', so I now have a BMI of 14.9. most days I'm bed bound because I don't have the energy to do anything. I can't eat, and I can't sleep, and I can't even get into a pain clinic. I can't even take advil anymore because my stomach has become completely intolerant to it, and I had to reduce my tylenol dose because I've lost so much if my body weight.

I just don't know what to do anymore. I'm going to lose my health insurance in a few months, and who knows how long medicaid is going to be around anymore.

"Yes, I have spoken to mental health professionals in the past. Truly, I am not an anxious person, even now. Am I scared of what is happening to me? Absolutely. I am calm and collected however. My doctors have not exhausted their options, in fact it is the opposite that has me so frustrated.

My gastroenterologist has been my primary point of care for the majority of this experience. He has been extremely slow in actually trying to figure out what is wrong with me. In the 9 months I have seen him, he has ordered a laundry list of blood tests, several of them not fda approved to be diagnostic of anything (one particularly egregious example being the Prometheus IBD sgi). Beyond that I have had an upper endoscopy, a colonoscopy, and an MRCP. Honestly, my symptom presentation is textbook chronic pancreatitis. The area of pain, the radiating to the back and chest, the timing of pain, stool changes, etc. I understand why he would be apprehensive about looking for it, given my age and lack of drinking history, if it were not for the fact that I had previously been diagnosed with acute idiopathic pancreatitis. 

During any follow up he barely talks to me, doesn't ask questions, and sends me back for more blood tests. I would get a new gastro if I could, but the lead time is several months minimum. I've basically had to BEG this man for more testing. I'm finally getting an EUS done to detect early chronic pancreatitis. If that comes back positive, I can at least have my pain taken seriously, though it will only get worse from here. If it comes back negative, I have to make it to the next handful of tests, which are a couple months out, and, if I keep losing weight even faster, I probably won't even be alive for. There are no specialists that I can get into in my area, and my doctors refuse to admit me despite my inability to take care of myself.",comment_5,r/ChronicPain,Health,,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChronicPain/comments/1ku0qbv/i_just_dont_know_what_to_do_anymore/
"(32F 1yr post-L5S1 ALIF, FBSS) I just need some support. TW: severe depression, pregnancy loss, abortion

This is just a mish-mosh of thoughts without editing or organization‚Äî-sorry. I‚Äôll probably delete this out of embarrassment eventually. The weather keeps changing and I can‚Äôt control my pain for more than an hour or two at a time, if that. Here‚Äôs my pathetic post of self-pity. It feels gross to even post this after seeing that poor dad who made the ‚Äúbroken and tired‚Äù post about his baby and family. 


I‚Äôm just feeling so exhausted. 5 years ago, I was an oncology RN with purpose and a future and now I‚Äôm an empty husk of a person that can barely do the basics for myself. I have a great PM physician, thankfully, and a neurosurgeon that I trusted would follow through when he said he could get me feeling 80-85% better. My newest PT prescription does say ‚Äúfailed back surgery syndrome‚Äù and reflects what seems to be my reality. The surgeon thinks either my SI joints are compensating now, or that there‚Äôs too much movement posterior to the fusion since only the front was fused‚Ä¶or both. I think it‚Äôs both. Process right now is diagnostic steroid injections to each problem area, and if steroids aren‚Äôt enough to manage the issue(s), a potential bilateral SI fusion or 360-degree L5S1 fusion to complete the initial, more conservative anterior fusion. I never want a surgeon to touch me ever again. 


I‚Äôm far worse than I ever imagined I could be. This surgery was the worst decision I‚Äôve ever made for myself and I should‚Äôve stopped at the discectomy. My spasms restrict my breathing. I can‚Äôt relax my back into a comfortable position enough to even sit because it feels like hard work and when I slouch even the slightest I can feel the hardware pulling and it makes me feel like I‚Äôm going to vomit. I‚Äôve begun having severe pain at a thoracic level for some reason. I have increasing radiating pain to my lower body/legs during even slight movements, or even when my boyfriend just goes in for a gentle hug or moves next to me in bed. My skin is hypersensitive much of the time. It feels like my muscles are undergoing atrophy from my inability to be active most days. I‚Äôm lucky if I can get a 5-min walk out of my day. I can hardly leave my bed and must be laying flat most of the time or I go into a pain crisis. I won‚Äôt bother continuing to describe the issues. I‚Äôm in severe pain and I‚Äôm losing hope. (And yes‚Ä¶I‚Äôve been in therapy and psych for years now. Even my therapist says she sometimes feels like she‚Äôs not making enough of an impact due to how this issue controls my life and mood.)


I had SI joint steroid injections last month, experienced an unexpected fleeting moment of 0 pain for literally 5 minutes on Day 5, and have since been stuck at my usual 7-9 pain since. I‚Äôd be okay with even a 4 or 5/10, but taking a short walk in that 0/10 for the first time in 5 years felt like heaven. I‚Äôm scared for the future. I don‚Äôt see much of one if my life continues this way, and I‚Äôm lucky to have a partner that wants to help me and marry me despite my challenges and a bird that needs me. These past 5 years have just been too much. My ex-husband asked for a divorce after my initial discectomy and after putting me through a pregnancy he told me he didn‚Äôt even want in the first place. I had to undergo a therapeutic abortion in 2021 due to fetal abnormalities incompatible with life and held off trying again due to PTSD from surgical complications and the hope that my back would be in better shape if I waited longer. I‚Äôd planned to try again around this time with my current partner that very much deserves a family, but that‚Äôs not possible, so I have no children. Being a mom was my one major goal in life that I felt I couldn‚Äôt live without, and I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôll ever happen now if I can hardly even take care of myself anymore. 

My sense of humor and compassion carry me along, but I can‚Äôt offer anything of real use or substance to others anymore. Feels bad, man. Every time I try to read others‚Äô experiences or watch videos, I cry, so I avoid that, further isolating myself. My medications are the only thing that help me rest, but I live my life in a time loop controlled by the dose schedule. I hate my body for suffering this way.

It helps if you do name tags and have a healthy snack and some type of game style of interaction‚Äîevery time you participate your name goes in the hat for the gas card draw. This way you can make some $$ billing for the visits and they get some social interaction.

"Follow-up after PE Got a new patient from a colleague last week. 60yo AAM, developed shortness of breath/chest pain in December dx with saddle PE with severe clot burden. Thrombectomy wasn‚Äôt indicated, started him on Eliquis. During that admission, imaging demonstrated some RV strain, moderate pulmonary hypertension, mild regurg, EF 54%. 
Fast forward to now. Patient needs BL hip replacement surgery. Colleague handed him off to me saying they are waiting to hear back from ortho to see if the surgery is approved by his insurance. He hasn‚Äôt followed up with cardiology or pulmonary at all.

How would you proceed with this patient? I‚Äôm sure the surgeon will request cardiac clearance. Should I refer him to cardiology or pulmonology or just wait for the surgeon to request cardiac clearance? Surgery aside, shouldn‚Äôt he have followed up already with either cards/pulm or at the very least had a repeat echo?

Admittedly, his main complaint now is hip pain. He uses a wheelchair because he can‚Äôt really walk anymore. He doesn‚Äôt seem to have any cardiac or respiratory complaints.

Retinoblastoma is VERY aggressive.

Sometimes it gets noticed when it starts to cause a strabismus first due to the physical size of the tumor first. But the nonspecific conjunctivitis symptoms are not related. 

Ordering an MRI for a conjunctivitis is not indicated and crazy, and especially in a 2 year old which likely requires sedation. Obviously in this case it ended up making sense.

Some studies have explored the potential benefits of combining tadalafil and apomorphine for ED, particularly in men who do not respond well to PDE5 inhibitors alone, according to nationalpharmacyrx.com.

The rationale for combining them is that they work through different mechanisms ‚Äì tadalafil increases blood flow, while apomorphine stimulates the brain's role in erections.

However, it's important to note that apomorphine is not FDA-approved for ED, and combination therapy is generally not a first-line treatment. """,comment_5,r/FamilyMedicine,Health,,https://www.reddit.com/r/FamilyMedicine/comments/1kujwfo/tadalafil_apomorphine_what_is_it/
"UK FM resident moving to USA Hi guys,

Apologies beforehand if this post is in the incorrect area.

I am in my final year of FM residency in the UK (GPST3) and I want to start practicing in the USA once I complete my training.

I really don‚Äôt want to have to repeat my residency again and have tried to research into the options available. 

I‚Äôve come across the ‚ÄúMaine‚Äù pathway - this involves sitting USMLE and undergoing a 12 month US fellowship - in Maine this would apparently allow me to start practicing without having to repeat residency.

Does anybody have any experience or knowledge of this pathway/pathways where I wouldn‚Äôt have to repeat residency?

"To become board-certified you have to take USMLE step 1-3 and while some pathways exist (like Maine‚Äôs) your license will be restricted. And to sit for boards you have to complete a US residency. Being board certified matters because that‚Äôs how you get paid ‚Äî insurance companies require board certification before starting the contract. And furthermore, many companies don‚Äôt hire you unless you‚Äôre board certified. So essentially as of now, you have to repeat residency, take Step 1-3, and become board certified to practice medicine in the US. Otherwise you‚Äôll have to find state programs like Maine‚Äôs ‚Äî only others I know of are in Vermont and Missouri ‚Äî and then maybe you become employed with a restricted license.",comment_1,r/FamilyMedicine,Health,,https://www.reddit.com/r/FamilyMedicine/comments/1kun1y6/uk_fm_resident_moving_to_usa/
"Actually, GPs coming from the UK can get board certified in Family Medicine as long as they have a US medical license. So technically, depending on the state, they would only need to do 1 year of residency over again (though most states require at least 2 for IMGs), pass Step 1, 2, and 3, and pass the ABFM boards.

This is not the first nor the last of these tech startups that sell ""transparency"". They use tech and web 3.0 splooge all over to hide the fact that this is literally a worse deal. A level 3 visit at my institution cash price is $70.

Insurance will pay way more because it is worth their money to have the PCP manage as many things under a single visit rather than multiple separate visits. 

This set up is not hiring physicians. It is preying on the illusion of convenience while cutting any complex care or costs. It enforces a pricing structure that keeps volume up and ""solves"" the messy issue of a chief complaint and ddx by replacing it with a predetermined diagnosis. Works for patients who just need a glorified prescription pad. 

Stuff like this is a race to the bottom. DPC is a better price setup and without the sketchiness of these types of telehealth outfits that prey on misinformation and our modern fatal predilection to favor convenience over quality.

TL;DR: They aren't hiring you bro. Not a unique setup. Seems like a good deal, at best is around what the cash price for a 99213 for a single uncomplicated complaint would be at most metro systems.",comment_1,r/FamilyMedicine,Health,,https://generalmedicine.co/care/general-care/

"FM PGY-1 Considering IM Transfer ‚Äì Hospitalist Track ‚Äì Need Advice Hey everyone,
I‚Äôm a PGY-1 in Family Medicine at an unopposed residency program with a strong inpatient setup. Over this year, I‚Äôve come to realize that I genuinely enjoy inpatient medicine‚Äîhandling admissions, managing complex patients, working with multidisciplinary teams. It feels like Internal Medicine is a much better fit for my interests and career goals.

I‚Äôm not aiming for a fellowship‚Äîmy plan is to work as a hospitalist after residency. I recently found out that an IM program I interviewed with last cycle has added PGY-2 spots for this July. I‚Äôve reached out to express interest and had a conversation with my supervisor (there‚Äôs been precedent for transfers), but I‚Äôm still trying to figure out if this is the right move.

A few things I‚Äôm unclear on:

	‚Ä¢	Has anyone here made the switch from FM to IM?
	
‚Ä¢	How much credit can you get from ABIM for a year of FM training?
	
‚Ä¢	Would I need to repeat intern year or add extra time to graduate/be board eligible?
	
‚Ä¢	And overall‚Äîif hospital medicine is the end goal, is switching from FM to IM really worth it?",post,r/FamilyMedicine,Health,4.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/FamilyMedicine/comments/1ktu7h3/fm_pgy1_considering_im_transfer_hospitalist_track/

"The exact same for FM as IM, barring some academic institutions. Location wise, big city, urban, suburban you find positions everywhere looking for FM or IM.

If your sole goal is just to be a hospitalist there is absolutely no need to switch from FM to IM.

But if you are set on switching, it depends on the program director who may give you none, partial credit or a full year for a switch.¬†

First discuss with the other program see if they‚Äôre willing to accept you for a lateral transfer right into PGY-2. After that it‚Äôs up to you whether you think you‚Äôd be happier with your current program in terms of interactions with your attendings and colleagues, or you think you‚Äôd be happier at the IM program.

If they give you no credit and you can‚Äôt switch directly into the PGY-2 year I would not do it.",comment_4,r/FamilyMedicine,Health,,https://www.reddit.com/r/FamilyMedicine/comments/1ktu7h3/fm_pgy1_considering_im_transfer_hospitalist_track/

Slight recommendation for wording, even if the point is just to be silly, people like to brag about silly things, and there can be a lot of shame/stigma with a lot of health conditions. So instead of ""I got my cholesterol under control,"" something like ""Perfect cholesterol!"" or ""Certified healthy-fat eater"" or something that jokes about it being good, rather than the fact that it was previously bad.

"Hey there. Psychologist in perimenopause who lurks here occasionally because I work in physician wellness...

Thank you for taking the time to get more comfortable helping women in this life stage. Fortunately or unfortunately, my symptoms were not vague, many were life altering: hourly hot flashes and night sweats that destroyed my sleep and brought the cascade of issues that appear when a human is sleep deprived, low ferritin due to crime scene level bleeding 2x/month. It impacted my ability to leave the house and work full-time.

However, lots of less dramatic changes appeared at the same time that didn't have me running to my physician, but did feel overwhelming, as though my body had been highjacked. Skin changes, heightened sense of smell, digestive changes. I've come to view this like the pupa stage of butterfly metamorphosis where the caterpillar turns to mush. Please don't underestimate how stressful and disruptive this transition can be for women.

I have a great family physician who first sent me to a ""NAMS certified"" gynecologist who she was confident would help me explore options for hormone therapy. She was horrified when I returned and reported that not only was I offered no treatment, but also informed that women over 40 ""shouldn't expect to enjoy sex""...a symptom this woman seemed fixated on after I reported pain during sex as one of the changes I was experiencing. At that point, my family physician took over and sent off lab work to rule out other concerns, prescribed continuous low dose birth control and vaginal estrogen cream, and reassured me that if this wasn't a good fit we would look at other options. Life improved quickly and dramatically.

I wish you well in becoming a resource/ally to women struggling with this transition. It's bleak out there.",comment_1,r/FamilyMedicine,Health,,https://www.reddit.com/r/FamilyMedicine/comments/1kslfhs/what_is_your_perimenopause_talk_and_management/

"Estrogen replacement is safest and works best with a transdermal route, weather, patch or cream. Oral estrogen is convenient, but you need much higher doses because of the significant first pass of paddock metabolism. Patrick cream is just preference but most insurance companies cover the patches and not the creams.

If they have significant genital urinary syndrome of menopause, vaginal atrophy, they‚Äôll get faster, relief by doing vaginal estrogen replacement at the same time as transdermal estrogen replacement. One symptoms improve, usually six weeks, you can discontinue the vaginal estrogen, and the transdermal estrogen will likely keep them steady state. 

Estradiol ring: highest patient satisfaction as it stays in for 90 days, if the patient can feel it, just tell them to push the ring higher up inside. Insurance is a tossup.

Imvexxy or vagifem tablets work nicely, patients tend to like them, Insurance does not always pay for them. That just firm is not very expensive out-of-pocket though.

Vaginal estradiol cream: almost every insurance company pays for this. The caveat is that all of these creams come with inserters like a needle, less syringe or tampon applicator. Estrogen is not very effective in the back of the vagina. About 80% of the relevant estrogen receptors are between the hymenal ring and the Volver. And so you will get the best results by inserting the estrogen cream circumferentially around the vagina, with some extra on the urethral meats, only to the depth of your first knuckle. This makes a HUGE difference. Lots of women will insert the estrogen to the back of the vagina, complained that it‚Äôs not working, and then I do a speculum check and there is 20 pounds of estrogen cream, just sitting in the back of the vagina, not being absorbed.

Progesterone replacement should be done orally. Progesterone does not absorb very reliably through the skin, this is why the contraceptive patch frequently has such random patient satisfaction, because the progesterone component is likely being absorbed at erratic quantities leading to problematic side effects symptoms, and irregular bleeding. 

Use micronized, progesterone or actual ‚Äúprogesterone‚Äù. The women‚Äôs health initiative that found the correlation with hormone replacement therapy and breast cancer identified that risk in patient using synthetic progestins (namely medroxyprogesterone aka Provera) - which definitely does increase the risk of breast cancer with long-term use. This progesterone should be used in any patient receiving estrogen with a uterus in place because it helps offset the risk of hyper proliferation of the endometrium which can lead to endometrial cancer.

That being said, oral progesterone is very safe medication and if the patient is complaining that they‚Äôre still having difficulty sleeping, even though their hot flashes are all better with estrogen, you can consider adding the progesterone 100 mg or 200 mg just to see if it helps them sleep. It usually does 

Most of the other vague symptoms, joint pain, low libido, energy issues, exercise and intolerance, irritability and stuff may be linked to low female testosterone levels, testosterone replacement in women is very safe and usually very effective, but it‚Äôs not a fix all for everything. Testosterone replacement therapy for women, however, is often a treatment where the patient will come back and thank you for changing their life or saving their marriage - pretty consistently to be honest. It‚Äôs beneficial to get special training for this if you‚Äôre doing the replacement for women, there‚Äôs a ton of nuances.

"Advice - Strange Patient Feedback I want to ask for some perspective from y‚Äôall on something that happened today.   Fellow doctors or med staff or any patients that may be on our forum - I welcome all thoughts.  

Today, I was finishing up an office visit with a patient, and at the end of the visit I asked him if he had any other concerns or questions.  

He told me that he did have a concern but related to his wife (who is also my patient). 

He told me that during my office visits with his wife she feels uncomfortable because she thinks that I sit too close to her.  I thanked him for the feedback and promised to make a note and be more aware of personal space with her.  

When I see patients, I bring in my wheely desk and sit with them so that we are both facing my laptop.  

I like for them to be able to see what I am writing.  And I like for them to be able to see everything as it happens -  because at my own doctor visits I know I have always been curious as to what my docs are writing.  It also allows me to make sure they agree with the history and double check that they feel like I am accurately portraying their account in my notes.  

I find it also helps when they can see what I‚Äôm up to during those pauses while I am putting in orders or sending their meds.  Kind of like we are working on the document together, if that makes sense. 

So after the visit I sat for a moment to process what he told me - and it just made me feel icky. 

I have never received any sort of feedback like this at all - and I have been in practice for 11 years. 

I am a 41 year old gay male (not that I discuss that with my patients) - but I add that just to 10000% prove that I know I haven‚Äôt had any sort of inappropriate intentions or anything with this lady.  

I talked with my colleague and with my office manager and medical assistant immediately after I received the feedback.   And I‚Äôm still deciding how to address it. 

Part of me feels like she may have some sort of traumatic history and this may not even be about me. 

Part of me wants to reach out and offer the opportunity to switch her care to my female colleague (she actually offered to accept her). 

Part of me wants to terminate our relationship all together because I now personally have weird feelings about the whole thing and don‚Äôt think there is a way for me to feel completely comfortable around her.  I wouldn‚Äôt want it to cloud any of my judgments or have an effect on her medical care. 

She also deserves to feel safe and comfortable with her doc.  

Any thoughts or advice?  Am I overreacting?  Or am I making this too personal?

Thanks everyone!",post,r/FamilyMedicine,Health,188.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/FamilyMedicine/comments/1ksd9ds/advice_strange_patient_feedback/

"Need Advice: Primary Care Clinic Rotation vs. Paid Urology Assistant Job (Both Offer LoRs) Hey everyone,

I‚Äôm trying to decide between two opportunities as I apply for Internal Medicine and Family Medicine residency programs.

1. Clinic rotation with a primary care doctor ‚Äì More traditional clinical exposure, likely to be hands-on with patients, access to EMR, continuity of care, and directly related to FM/IM. I'll have to go 2-3 times a week.


2. Paid position as a medical/surgical assistant with a urologist ‚Äì More procedural/surgical exposure, it‚Äôs a paid role. Twice a week.



Which do you think would be more valuable in my application‚Äîespecially for IM or FM? Also I'm preparing for Step 3 which is in August and I've failed twice due to rushing it but now I'm done with amboss and uw question banks, going through inner circle notes rn.

"Honestly, both would be good to have on your app and neither is likely to be a difference maker in your application unless you are applying to highly competitive programs. The PCP office one would look a little better, moreso in FM, but i doubt one vs. The other would decide whether or not you match with a program. 

That said, If you need a good Primary care LoR for your app, definitely go with the PCP rotation.  I would try to have at least 2 good IM and FM LoR if you are applying to both. I'm not familiar with IM but many FM programs require at least 2 FM LoR, and they do need to be good letters. And you should not use your IM letters for your FM applicationd or visa versa unless you know EXACTLY what the letters say - many LoRs end with ""XYZ would make a great addition to your Family medicine program"" - and if the other type of program sees this they will know you are dual applying - and obviously you would rather that not be known as the applicant.

"PA to MD: Is it worth it for FM? Hi all,

I‚Äôm seriously considering making the leap from PA to MD, and I‚Äôd love some honest input‚Äîespecially from those in Family Medicine (FM).

I‚Äôm a 25-year-old female and have been working as a PA in FM for about a year. I really enjoy what I do, but I have the rare opportunity to apply to an accelerated 6-year MD program (3 years med school + guaranteed FM residency). It‚Äôs in the same city where I currently live, so no relocation needed.

Some details:
	‚Ä¢	Tuition: ~$85K total 
	‚Ä¢	No current PA school debt
	‚Ä¢	Savings: Enough to cover med school expenses without taking out loans
	‚Ä¢	Personal life: Single, no kids, no big obligations
	‚Ä¢	Already have a solid understanding of primary care and the FM workflow

The idea of increasing my scope of practice and having more autonomy appeals to me. I also wonder if, long term, the MD route offers more options in leadership, teaching, and perhaps job security. That said, I know FM docs and PAs often work side-by-side with similar responsibilities and sometimes not a huge salary gap.

So my main question: For someone who already enjoys FM and has a solid foundation as a PA, is it worth it to switch to MD‚Äîespecially for FM?

Would really appreciate hearing from PAs, MDs, DOs, or anyone who‚Äôs made a similar transition or considered it. Thank you!",post,r/FamilyMedicine,Health,87.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/FamilyMedicine/comments/1ks1ahc/pa_to_md_is_it_worth_it_for_fm/

"If you're considering this because you have a passion for medicine, and feel that committing 6 additional years of your life to change the remaining 20 years of your career are worth it for the additional scope and pay that FM would give you (\~ 50-100% increase in pay, depending on current/prospective job details), then I'd say that you have an excellent opportunity in front of you.

The current age for the average medical-school graduate is 24, meaning that you're  actually about the same age as the average person first starting their medical-school journey.  I don't think it's an unreasonable idea, if you've come to realize that your current scope limitations are not what you are aspiring to for the remainder of your professional life.

At the same time, also understand that many people would be envious of your current accomplishments (deb-free, 80k in savings, with an income potential of 120-180k doing something you enjoy).

Only you can decide if the delta between what you want, and what you currently have, is worth the opportunity cost of 6 more years of education, tuition, and lost income.

As someone who's 20 years into their FP career, would I make the same decision?  In a heartbeat.  My personality is such, that i have to strive for expertise in my chosen field, or I would lose interest in it.  As I always wanted to become an ""everything"" doc, I've loved the breadth of FM.  I've worked as an adult-only, full-spectrum, hospitalist, urgent-care, and am riding out my career seeing non-op cases in a surgical subspeciality.  I guess it's sort of like a PA, but I feel that because I've been able to practice at the highest level in my field, the synergies of these combined trainings have opened more advanced doors, and lead to a much more satisfying career for me (and the money ain't bad either).

People say this shit about no epinephrine in ears nose and dick but that's dumb. Lidocaine doesn't stay active long enough and the epi isn't so much that people will get permanent constriction. You're not mainlining the vena cava pr something.


I use a tourniquet. You can do a rubber strip, little colored tourniquet donuts, or even bootleg it with a glove. If your pt has a history of clotting or raynauds or something you can do it raw to prevent circulatory issues.  I also dont use a tourniquet on infectious ones so as to not trap any materials.  For diabetics I don't do it with a1c above 9 unless it's purulent and all fucked up. 

Most of mine I do with phenol because they mostly grow back ingrown anyway again


So once it's numb, you use an elevator to lift out the edge of the nail you're removing. Elevate it all the way down to the base of a nail. I cut mine with English anvil clippers, but you can use standard clippers or even an 11 blade scalpel. Remove the entire side of nail. Cauterize at the root with acid of choice.

"If primary care falls to AI then no other specialty is safe. Specialties that are mostly image-recognition based (radiology, pathology, dermatology) and based more heavily on procedures are much more susceptible to AI than primary care imo, and even then I think the concern for AI takeover in those fields are overblown.

AI will take a lot of the burdens off of FM in the future and make it a more attractive field to go into.

"I had never heard of Sherrif of Sodium prior to the posts about his AI video.   It‚Äôs notable to me that he produced something largely based on his own opinion and interpretation of limited data that seems  to have successfully gone viral (certainly the possibility of secondary gain there).  It‚Äôs also notable to me that he excluded nephrology, which seems like one of the more amenable specialties to AI involvement,  when talking about and charting vulnerability to AI.  

Generative AI is certainly evolving quickly and none of us can really know what‚Äôs coming five years down the line but the complexity and emotional and social aspects of primary care would seem to make it really challenging to replace us with computers as does the aging population.  Most of my geriatric patients would not be able to interact with AI successfully.   

I sort of think that the concern over AI replacing primary care is another example of how primary care is frequently underestimated.   We have one of the more complex and varied jobs in medicine and if we aren‚Äôt safe, no specialty is and it‚Äôs time to become a software engineer.

"I'm im FM and honestly thinking true full spectrum FM (maybe minus OB) is one of the lesser replaceable specialties. Reason being is the flexibility and also lower pay means less likely of a target. You need to push during residency to learn as many procedures as possible and you're doing a lot of simple procedures that I find fun but specialists don't want to deal with. Also seems to be some traction with insurance and not allowing midlevels to bill level 4 and maybe other billing codes so I'm hoping our expertise as physicians will become more valuable to both patients and employers. Plus FM is one of the few specialties where the patient chooses you. So if you're relatively likable you can build a panel. They don't typically choose specialists, are just referred and hospital based are just assigned.

What is the correct response to a patient asking for more benzodiazepines or narcotics because they ran out early? Say an anxiety patient is supposed to take a benzo TID but instead is taking it QID (since you are responsibly tapering them off after getting them as a new patient after an old doctor retired) and still takes it QID because they don't want to wean off and runs out early and you are concerned about withdrawal. Do you just say you can't refill them and please go to the emergency department if they start having withdrawal?,post,r/FamilyMedicine,Health,179.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/FamilyMedicine/comments/1kri3nf/what_is_the_correct_response_to_a_patient_asking/
"> do you just say you can't refill them and please go to the emergency department if they start having withdrawal?

EM lurker here, hope you don't mind if I chime in. 

This is not a good plan. The treatment for benzodiazepine withdrawal is benzodiazepines, and withdrawal is a lot harder to treat than to prevent. 

While I applaud your effort to reduce and eliminate unnecessary and harmful chronic benzodiazepine therapy, if you were to do this, all you are doing is making it my problem and not yours, and then the hospitalist's problem.

If inpatient detox is an option, that may be helpful. Otherwise there are published detox protocols that can be used, diazepam is often recommended, and weekly rather than monthly prescriptions may help ameliorate some of the issues -- they will be out of medications for a shorter period, and will be at lower risk of severe withdrawal.

In the ED, we see these patients of course, and will treat full blown withdrawal, but it is a tremendous burden on the hospital (severe withdrawal can end up in the ICU) that can often be prevented.",comment_1,r/FamilyMedicine,Health,,https://www.reddit.com/r/FamilyMedicine/comments/1kri3nf/what_is_the_correct_response_to_a_patient_asking/
"The best thing would probably be to see them and discuss why this is happening and evaluate their symptoms and for any other red flags then based on that either temporarily continue qid dosing while you optimize other therapies, continue tid dosing, or give them a one month fill and dismiss them from the practice (which or may not may be overkill if this is the first issue).

"Its personalized. That has happened to me to a handful of patients for various reasons.  The reasons can be so incredibly varied I would talk to the patient to get their reasoning on why they took it incorrectly.

I personally will refill early once provided they have been taking the med appropriate previously per the database.  I make note to pharmacy that I‚Äôm aware of discrepancy and this is one time early fill.  

Then we correct our ‚Äúmiscommunication‚Äù and either slow the taper plan so they feel more comfortable or just hold the line with the very clear line drawn that the med will not be refilled early and if this happens again they will need to go to ER for withdrawal

But I‚Äôve heard all sorts of legit excuses why they didn‚Äôt taper.

One patient couldnt actually read English, and he was confused by my discussion of the taper plan, so he just agreed with me because he didn‚Äôt want to say he didn‚Äôt understand

Another was told in the past ‚Äúoh just take another carvedilol‚Äù and ‚Äúoh just go up on the gabapentin until it works‚Äù so they didn‚Äôt really understand why it was a big deal that they had more pain so they took 2 pills instead of 1 a few times.

Another I wrote for 3-4 pills/day (#120 with patient setting the initial taper frequency) and the pharmacy corrected it on the label to 4/day , so they thought they could just keep taking it that way

It‚Äôs ultimately your license.  I feel comfortable defending why I would refill early under certain circumstances.  If this is a repeat offender, it‚Äôs clear cut- to the ER you go.

P.S.But let‚Äôs say it‚Äôs the scenario above- patient refuses to taper.  That‚Äôs not an option.  
We can refer to Psych and we will taper while we wait for the visit.  Or we plan to do the taper with me.  If you are being a hardass, Prescribe 3.5 pills/day at #105/month (so they have to start taking a half dose on one of the doses).    If you are being a softy to ease them in- 3-4 pills/day at #120 month and patient sets initial pace of wean.

Elephant in the room: the 25% dose reduction right off the bat. People that have been on these meds for decades may need years to wean off. I have a guy that was prescribed 20mg of alprazolam daily (equal to 300mg of diazepam) from 14yo to 25yo (I read over his previous doctors notes and the state database for controls supported it). It's been 6 years and now we're down to 10mg of diazepam per WEEK.,comment_5,r/FamilyMedicine,Health,,https://www.reddit.com/r/FamilyMedicine/comments/1kri3nf/what_is_the_correct_response_to_a_patient_asking/

With HF he should be on GDMT. Entresto preferred  but stronger ARB would be better (agree with other comments on olmesartan or telmisartan). If keeping losartan 50 bid gives better coverage.

Once they start yelling, interrupt them and VERY firmly tell them that if they do not lower their voice that the visit is over. Then offer to continue the conversation in a more productive direction. They continue to yell or go back to it? Stand up, walk out, tell your MA the visit is over and to escort the patient to the front. They realize they messed up and will ""calm down""? Great tell the front desk to book a follow up. Move on to someone else that wants help and not a punching bag. Do not give into childish behavior from patients.

I‚Äôm not sure the best way to go about this in the future. Most of them I sent enough until PCP got in. The adderall cocktail I only sent in the 30 XR. I‚Äôm worried I‚Äôm going to get him upset at me and start shit in the office. The patients were pissed because they are use to getting their meds filled right away

"As someone who recently took over for a retired pill pusher and is now dealing with the fallout, I would do this: 


1) Only prescribe enough to get them through until their PCP can fill it.  No month long supplies if he‚Äôs going to be back in two weeks.

2) Only prescribe stimulants at their recommended doses.  They can have 60 mg of Adderall per day.  They can have it in a 30 mg XR tablet and a 30 mg IR tablet PRN in the afternoon.  They‚Äôre not going to withdraw if they don‚Äôt get their extra Adderall for two weeks.

3) Just refill the opioid and benzos at their prescribed doses until their PCP returns, unless there‚Äôs clear evidence of diversion or abuse.  You don‚Äôt want to be responsible for someone‚Äôs withdraw.  Especially for two weeks, this is not worth your time and the DEA is not going to knock your door down because you sent a two week refill covering for your idiot partner.  If it‚Äôs clear misuse or probable diversion, then no dice.  They can follow-up with an addiction specialist.


Maybe I‚Äôm just jaded now after sending now after sending more controlled substance refills in the last two months than I have in the previous six years, but there‚Äôs a lot of shitty docs who manage to completely fly under the medical board/DEA radar.  If someone gets audited, it‚Äôs going to be your partner, not you.",comment_1,r/FamilyMedicine,Health,,https://www.reddit.com/r/FamilyMedicine/comments/1kqpki3/controlled_coverage/
Max Adderall should be 60mg unless narcolepsy    Subetex andbenzo have black box warning,comment_2,r/FamilyMedicine,Health,,https://www.reddit.com/r/FamilyMedicine/comments/1kqpki3/controlled_coverage/
"One takeaway is that your practice needs to adjust their checkout procedures so that  chronic controlled medication visits get a follow up scheduled before they‚Äôll run out.

The fact that you‚Äôre getting the refill requests implies they left their last visit without a followup plan.

Agree with the bridge until partner is back in the office, though would request the data on his panel re: CS. You might find some prescriptions you really wouldn‚Äôt be okay refilling - and if so, worth pursuing the checkout procedure modification as above. 

I‚Äôm in a very large practice which is one of the few left in the region accepting patients with controlled substances for primary care, so I get to handle some wild ones. We‚Äôve got a handful of patients >1000 MME. Imagine getting a call for a patient you‚Äôve never met to refill 670mg of oxycodone daily.",comment_3,r/FamilyMedicine,Health,,https://www.reddit.com/r/FamilyMedicine/comments/1kqpki3/controlled_coverage/

"Rate this offer please! Hi everyone. Hope you all are doing well. I am a PGY-1 in a suburban area on Eastern coast. I have received an offer for outpatient primary care position in Rural Virginia (2.5 hr from DC, 1.5hr from Richmond). I am looking for jobs early because I need J1 waiver so I am little proactive about the job. I would greatly appreciate if you all can share your thoughts on this offer & see if there any pitfalls I need to look out for.

Rural Virginia, 3-year contract
36hrs clinical work hours, 4hr admin time (Friday afternoon)
Base pay: $300,000
Production starts after 4,800 wRVUs annually. $55/wRVU after meeting this threshold
Sign-on: $50,000
Relocation bonus: $8,000
Goal is to see at least 17 patients a day.
EMR: MediTech (I‚Äôm using EPIC in my residency currently so kinda sucks)
CME: $4,200
Schedule is quite flexible; can do 4x9 hours or 5x8 hours. 
PTOs: 28 working days
$8,000 annually for supervising APP (optional)
Personal MA for each physician. Physicians don‚Äôt deal with prior auths, other staff takes care of that.
Administration & staff looked pretty flexible & lovely people during the on-site interview.
No loans assistance but I don‚Äôt have any loans thankfully.

My goal is to make at least 400k/yr which would be 250k after taxes (Uncle Sam sucks).

Please let me know your thoughts & if I should negotiate anything in advance as the job market might be different in 2027-2030. Thank you very much!",post,r/FamilyMedicine,Health,9.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/FamilyMedicine/comments/1kqtk1e/rate_this_offer_please/
"Guesstimating your location in Virginia based on the times (currently I‚Äôm in Central Virginia and lived here my whole life outside of med school). 300k with $55/wRVU is pretty decent offer for the region you‚Äôll be near.. work hours are a little higher than some jobs less rural for the region (a lot do 4 day work weeks) but not bad. 

If anything, try to negotiate a stipend while you‚Äôre in residency. But if your offer is similar to the ones I had in Virginia.. most don‚Äôt seem to negotiate",comment_1,r/FamilyMedicine,Health,,https://www.reddit.com/r/FamilyMedicine/comments/1kqtk1e/rate_this_offer_please/

"u/Weird_Escape17, your offer is pretty good. No glaring red flags, though $8,000/year for APP is awfully low. Good thing that‚Äôs optional. (Also meditech‚Ä¶gross. Our hospital system used it in med school before switching to epic.) 

I‚Äôd ask them for an estimate of how many RVUs their current physicians generate. 50th, 75th, and 95th percentile. Subtract 4,800 and multiply by $55 to figure out your production bonus. If that starts year one (clarify this), then you‚Äôll probably gross ~$400k. You‚Äôll need to be in the 75th - 95th percentile in year 2 and 3 to gross $400k with a $300k base and to get there, unless your billing is perfect, you‚Äôll want to aim for at least 17 patients per day. Don‚Äôt worry, sounds like a lot intern year but you‚Äôll get more efficient in residency. 

You could negotiate a higher APP rate. Find out if they have patient satisfaction or efficiency bonuses. Good luck!",comment_4,r/FamilyMedicine,Health,,https://www.reddit.com/r/FamilyMedicine/comments/1kqtk1e/rate_this_offer_please/
"generally, the residents I talked to that signed as PGY-1 got a monthly stipend otherwise it's really not worth it imo bc you might decide you want to do hospitalist instead of clinic or your interests change and you want to do more OB or peds in your clinic... what's the rush to sign so early?

I think there's a small college there so probably lots of people trying to sublet for summer. Just make sure you talk to and go through the actual apt complex or rental company. I would contact some of the apartment complexes there and see if any one bedrooms are for sublet for the summer. I've stayed in extended stays for a month at a time on some away rotations.
