"A therapist has a theory that couples who make love once a day are the happiest. So he decides to test this theory. He convenes all the couples he can find at a special seminar.

He then starts by asking the many people in the audience.

‚ÄúHow many people here make love once a day?‚Äù

Half the people raise their hands, each of them grinning widely.

‚ÄúOnce a week?‚Äù

A third of the audience members raise their hands, their grins a bit less vibrant.

""How many of you make love once a month?‚Äù

A few hands tepidly go up. No grins could be sighted.

‚ÄúOK, how about once a year?‚Äù

To his shock, one man in the back jumps up and down, jubilantly waving his hands and whistling. The therapist is shocked - this man's reaction completely disproves his theory!

‚ÄúIf you make love only once a year,‚Äù he asks, ‚Äúwhy are you so happy?‚Äù

The man shouts: ""Today‚Äôs my birthday!‚Äù",post,r/Jokes,Comedy,2180.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/1ktdl4u/a_therapist_has_a_theory_that_couples_who_make/

"A young man went into confession crying, and told the priest: ‚ÄúForgive me father for I have sinned‚Äù. ‚ÄúWhat have you done?‚Äù asked the priest. 

‚ÄúA few weeks ago I went to the library. I remained there until closing time and when I was about to go home, rain started pouring down. It was so intense I had to wait in the library. I had waited for a while with the librarian, a young attractive single girl, then one thing led to another, and I ended up sleeping with her‚Äù. The man stopped talking but kept weeping.

‚ÄúWell don‚Äôt cry, it‚Äôs a sin but it is not that bad. You should say 5 Hail Marys and it will be forgiven‚Äù. Said the priest.

‚ÄúBut it doesn't end there‚Äù the man kept sobbing. ‚Äúa few days later my elderly neighbor asked me to help her with her computer. Her husband was hospitalized and she couldn't send an email to her son. I went there and fixed the problem, but when I was about to leave, rain started pouring down. It was really stormy and I had to wait. One thing led to another and I ended up sleeping with the old lady‚Äù the man cried.

‚ÄúOh dear well that makes it harder indeed, but still - you should say 15 Hail Marys and you will be forgiven‚Äù Said the priest.

‚ÄúOh I‚Äôm afraid the worst part is still ahead‚Äù cried the man. ‚ÄúYesterday I went to the barber. I was his last client that day. As soon as he finished and was about to close the shop rain started pouring down so intensely, I had to wait with him.

"Help me, doc! Guy goes to a psychiatrist. ""Doc, I'm going nuts, you gotta help me.""



""Every night, I go to sleep, and I dream the same dream. I'm driving a long-distance truck across the country - I wake up every morning exhausted. I'm getting no rest, my real work is suffering, what can I do?""



The doc thinks a bit, and says, ""Okay, try this. Tonight, when you're asleep, and you're getting ready to get in your truck... call me. I'll come over and drive your shift for you, you can take the night off and sleep. Let me know how this goes.""



The next morning, the doc gets a call from his patient. ""Doc, you're a genius! Last night, I called you as I was getting ready to leave, you came over, I got to stay home! I woke up refreshed, today is gonna be wonderful!""



The doctor is really proud of himself, but tells the guy to come in next week anyway, in case the plan breaks down. Patient shows up, tells the doc he's never felt better, every night he gets a full night's sleep because the doc has been driving his truck, he's over the moon. The psychiatrist is happy too - fastest 'cure' he's ever seen.



A couple of months later, someone new comes in. ""I don't know what to do - I'm having the same dream every night. I go to sleep and then I'm supposed to take a fishing trawler out... I wake up every morning exhausted, every muscle hurts. I can't go on like this!""



The doctor says ""Don't worry, I had a patient like this before, I've got you. Tonight, after you go to sleep, when you're getting ready to get on the boat, give me a call. I'll come over and take your shift for you. Try this for a week, come back and see me on Tuesday.""



Tuesday, the guy comes back - he looks awful. Clothes in disarray, hasn't washed, hasn't shaved. Doc says ""What happened? Didn't you call me to take your shift for you?""



""Yeah, doc, I called you. And called you. And called you. Every night, I'd call you up... and every night, your wife would tell me you were out driving some stupid truck!""",post,r/Jokes,Comedy,576.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/1kt172z/help_me_doc/

"A guy had a hardware business selling nails, and it was about to go bankrupt. He put out a job ad looking for a marketing executive. One day, a candidate shows up at the office and is greeted by the owner:

‚ÄúGood morning, sir.‚Äù

‚ÄúGood morning. I'm here for the job posting.‚Äù

‚ÄúYes, sir, I‚Äôm in real trouble... I‚Äôm about to go under.‚Äù

‚ÄúTell me, my friend, what‚Äôs the name of your company?‚Äù

‚ÄúSmith‚Äôs Nail Company.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat kind of trashy name is that? How the hell are you supposed to sell anything with that garbage?‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm desperate, sir... I don‚Äôt know what to do anymore.‚Äù

‚ÄúTrust me. Give me fifteen days, and Smith‚Äôs Nails will be known all over the world.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat do I need to do?‚Äù

‚ÄúGo to the beach.‚Äù

‚ÄúThe beach?‚Äù

‚ÄúI said go to the beach and stop asking questions!‚Äù

A few days later, the owner finally decided to take the advice and headed to the beach with his wife. He was driving down the highway when he looked up at a hillside and saw a giant billboard showing Jesus nailed to the cross. Underneath, in big red letters, it said:

‚ÄúSmith‚Äôs Nails ‚Äî Holding Strong for 2000 Years.‚Äù

He slammed on the brakes, grabbed his phone, and called the executive:

‚ÄúTake that billboard down right now, you idiot! The church is going to sue me! What the hell were you thinking?‚Äù

‚ÄúI did it for the marketing, sir...‚Äù

‚ÄúTake it down, you moron!‚Äù

‚ÄúAlright, sir,‚Äù said the executive.

A week later, the man went back to the beach. He looked up at the hillside to check if the billboard was still there... and it was. Same billboard ‚Äî except now there was just the cross.

Jesus was lying on the ground, and underneath, in big white letters, it said:

"In dutch there's a similar joke with the ""van leeuwen company""
""Met nagels van van leeuwen, hangt ie hier al eeuwen"" (with nails from van leeuwen, he's hanging here for ages)

But, !! 
there's a third revision.

I tried translating and getting it to rhyme just as well.

-

An ad man was hired by Van Leeuwen, a wholesaler of nails and spikes, to come up with a catchy campaign. To avoid stifling the creative process, he was given complete artistic freedom.

After half a week of thinking, he announced the slogan and accompanying billboard were finished. Curious, Mr. Van Leeuwen went to the ad man‚Äôs office to see the result.

With great anticipation, he looked at the design: a larger-than-life photo of Jesus on the cross. In elegant lettering (yes, you could say nail script), the text below read:
""He‚Äôs been hanging here for ages ‚Äî with nails from Van Leeuwen.""

Horrified, the wholesaler exclaimed:
‚ÄúNow come on ‚Äî we‚Äôre in a deeply religious region, this is completely inappropriate! I demand a different campaign, no blasphemy and such!‚Äù

Annoyed that his (truly brilliant) slogan was deemed too crude, the ad man went back to work.

A few hours later, he announced he had found the final version. Once again, Van Leeuwen visited the office.

‚ÄúNo more Jesus, right?‚Äù he asked nervously.
‚ÄúSir, rest assured ‚Äî you will not find Jesus on the billboard anymore!‚Äù

With a sweeping gesture, the ad man revealed his pi√®ce de r√©sistance: a billboard showing an empty cross and Jesus on the ground..

Below it, the text read:
""Well, He‚Äôs taken quite a fall ‚Äî with Van Leeuwen nails, He‚Äôd still hang here for all!""

Van Leeuwen still wasn‚Äôt happy with the new slogan and banned the new billboards.

Several hours later, Van Leeuwen returned once more. Beaming with pride, the ad man unveiled his latest poster:

""The guys at Van Leeuwen are stubborn as hell,
but damn, their nails sure hold things well!""",comment_2,r/Jokes,Comedy,,https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/1ksp6z6/a_guy_had_a_hardware_business_selling_nails_and/

Her mother slaved over a hot stove all day, while the father cleaned the house and cut the grass. They both wore their best clothes and waited for their daughter.

At 8pm they heard the doorbell ring. They opened the door and she was standing next to a huge man, full of tattoos, and a face that looked like it had been in every possible fight, with scars aplenty crossing his face. He looked like he beats people up for a living.

After some hesitant pleasantries, the shocked parents take their daughter to the kitchen. ""What the hell?"" asked her mother, ""Why would you date a guy like that, he looks like a thug!""

We had a friend who re-enlisted in the service and he asked us to keep his vintage/antique motorcycle (1940s rebuilt) safe until he could set up safe storage wherever he would be shipped out to. 

About a week in, we kept seeing bikers driving through our neighborhood, eyeing the bike, and we got worried they were planning on stealing it, so we opted to move it into our storage shed. We made sure we did nothing to cause damage to such a beautiful machine.

Not even a day after we moved the bike a gang showed up (local chapter of the Hell's Angels, about 40). One man and one woman rang our doorbell and when we saw them, I grabbed our house phone ready to dial 911 while my husband stepped outside to find out what was up.

My husband came back in with the couple and took them out to the shed to show them the bike. Smiles and handshakes later, the couple and the rest of the gang left. 

What we didn't know was our friend was a member of the chapter, they knew where he had left his bike and they got worried when the bike disappeared from the head of our driveway. They had been driving through the neighborhood several times a day to keep an eye on the bike for their club member.",comment_3,r/Jokes,Comedy,,https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/1ksm1w8/a_young_womans_parents_are_excited_to_meet_her/

"I know this is a joke sub but‚Ä¶..¬†

I was driving an APC on a public road one night when a driver passed us and the passenger threw a beer bottle at us. I mentioned it in passing back at base, and before I knew it the MP‚Äôs were asking questions. A few hours or so later I was asked to go to the MP‚Äôs office as the local police wanted to speak to me.¬†

So I went to speak with them in front of a first lieutenant of the MP‚Äôs and my colonel. The cops asked me what had happened and if I had the license plate of the offending vehicle. I told them, as the MP and colonel knew very well, and said that I had hit save on the camera in the APC when they got in front of us, so yeah I had the plate. I did this just in case they were to complain (not everyone loves the army), and then I would have the bottle throw as well as we have many cameras on these vehicles.¬†

The police asked if I wanted to make a report. I said no. I didn‚Äôt give a shit, I mean, it is not like the APC took any damage or is mine. The police officer asked if I was sure. I was about to say yes when the MP coughed. I looked at him and he nodded. I looked at my CO and he nodded. So I said I wanted to make a report.¬†

I later learned they knew very well who was involved as they had done other similar shit around base. It was the daughter of the colonel who drove the car and her shit-for-brains boyfriend who threw the bottle. And dad couldn‚Äôt get through to her. It ended up with her turning witness, to avoid the hit n run charge, and him pleading it down, but god damn if I wasn‚Äôt made a tool in the colonel‚Äôs parenting.¬†",comment_3,r/dadjokes,Comedy,,https://www.reddit.com/r/dadjokes/comments/1ksoo3o/checked_my_phone_and_had_like_50_texts_from_my/

"I say, I say, I say. How do you make a Venician blind? 
Making a DIY Venetian blind involves cutting, sewing, and assembling fabric and wood or metal slats. You'll need to measure your window, prepare the fabric, create hem pockets, and attach the slats. 
Here's a more detailed breakdown:
1. Measuring and Preparing:
Measure your window and cut the fabric accordingly, adding extra for hems and allowances.
Create hems by folding and stitching the fabric edges. 
2. Assembling the Blind:
Attach dowels or pockets along the bottom and top edges of the fabric. 
Sew on rings or hooks to the fabric for attaching slats. 
Attach the slats to the rings or hooks, ensuring they are aligned and evenly spaced. 
Attach the bottom rail. 
3. Installing the Blind:
Attach brackets to the window frame using screws and wall plugs.
Hang the blind on the brackets. 
4. Optional Features:
Add a cord system for raising and lowering the blind. 
Consider using Velcro or other methods to attach fabric pockets for dowels.

The operator replies, ‚ÄúCalm down, sir. I can help. First, make sure he‚Äôs dead.‚Äù

So... how'd jesus walk on water? How did he save everyone?

By pulling the sword from a salt rock. Sticking it back in. Then letting all his friends have a turn. pulling out and sticking it back in.

"Husbands Vs Horses 
Good Things About Husbands:


Husbands are less expensive to shoe.
Feeding a husband doesn't require anything that even mildly compares with the
hassle of putting up hay.
A lame husband can still work.
A husband with a belly-ache doesn't have to be walked.
Husbands don't try to scratch their heads on your back.
They're better able to understand puns.
If they're playing hard to catch you *may* be able to run them down on foot.
They know their name.
They pay their own bills.
They apologize when they step on your toes.
They seldom refuse to get in the vehicle.
They don't panic, yelling and running all through the house when you leave
them alone. (unless you left the kids too)
For a nominal fee you can hire someone else to clip them.


The Horse's Advantage:


If they don't work out you can sell them.
They don't come with in-laws.
You don't have to worry about your children looking like them.
You never have to iron their saddle pads.
If you get too fat for one you can shop for a bigger one.
They smell good when they sweat.
You can repair their ""clothes"" with duct tape.
It's possible to keep them from ""jumping the fence"".
You can force them to stay in good physical condition...with a whip if necessary.
They don't want their turn at the computer.
They turn white with age, but not bald.
They learn to accept restraint.
They don't care what you look like, as long as you have a carrot.",post,r/cleanjokes,Comedy,65.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/cleanjokes/comments/1kt2ozu/husbands_vs_horses/

In any case, if we keep our discussion relevant to the topic at hand, I'm not at all a commie, and communism isn't the same thing as socialism, the former being an autocratic political theory and the latter an economic theory. I do believe in democracy as a political system, at least for now, where I think it's worked fairly well in the USA for the most part for most of our history, whereas capitalism has not, but I think democratic socialism can work instead, and I think we'll end up with it pretty soon whether we want it or not!

"African Jack Once upon a time, long, long ago there were two unique lions in the jungles of Africa. Both, it seems, had human-like qualities that allowed them to claim territory, daring the other to cross over the line. Strange as it seems, the boundary between their turf became a well traveled trail through the jungle. 



All day, every day, both lions lay in the brush staring across the trail at their compatriot, daring him to cross into their territory. 



The local natives knew of this animal feud, but all this was unbeknown to African Jack, a well-known and very publicized guide who did not speak Lionese and was unfamiliar with the territory. 



While he was leading a safari through the jungle, the travelers had to walk and cut vines with their machetes, and all this constant hacking brush had them worn to a frazzle. After seeing two or three of his safari drop from exhaustion, African Jack decided to stop on the trail between these two lions and camp for the night. 



After setting up camp, eating, and getting his safari settled African Jack sat on a stump and began reading. While he was busily engaged in the printed page, the two lions, simultaneously, pounced on African Jack and ate him on the spot. 



When the 6 o'clock news heard of the tragedy, they reported, ""African Jack killed this evening. The motive is unclear, but it is reported he was reading between the lions.""",post,r/cleanjokes,Comedy,51.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/cleanjokes/comments/1kl2hlg/african_jack/

"It was 1988. A couple lived near the ocean and used to walk the beach a lot... ... One summer they noticed a girl who was at the beach pretty much every day. She wasn‚Äôt unusual, nor was the travel bag she carried, except for one thing. She would approach people who were sitting on the beach, glance around, then speak to them.

Generally, the people would respond negatively and she would wander off, but occasionally someone would nod and there would be a quick exchange of money for something she carried in her bag. The couple assumed she was selling drugs and debated calling the cops, but since they didn‚Äôt know for sure they just continued to watch her.

After a couple of weeks the wife asked, ‚ÄúHoney, have you ever noticed that she only goes up to people with boom boxes and other electronic devices?‚Äù

He hadn‚Äôt and said so. Then she said, ‚ÄúTomorrow I want you to get a towel and our big radio and go lie out on the beach. Then we can find out what she‚Äôs really doing.‚Äù

Well, the plan went off without a hitch, and the wife was almost hopping up and down with anticipation when she saw the girl talk to her husband and then leave. The man walked up the beach and met his wife at the road. ‚ÄúWell, is she selling drugs?‚Äù she asked excitedly.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo, she‚Äôs not.‚Äù he said, enjoying this probably more than he should have.

‚ÄúWell, what is it, then?‚Äù his wife fairly shrieked.

The man grinned and said. ‚ÄúHer name is Sheena, but she prefers to be called 'shee', and she‚Äôs selling batteries.‚Äù

‚ÄúBatteries?‚Äù cried the wife.

‚ÄúYes,‚Äù he replied. ‚ÄúShee sells C cells by the Seashore.‚Äù",post,r/cleanjokes,Comedy,1290.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/cleanjokes/comments/1kizndc/it_was_1988_a_couple_lived_near_the_ocean_and/

The attendant filled my two-gallon can, and I lugged it back and poured the gas into the tank. But when I tried to unlock the car door, it wouldn't open. Just then, I noticed an identical old car parked a short distance away. THAT was my car, I had filled a strangers gas tank.

"A Dog Story Shortly after our 10 year old Cocker Spanial died, I brought a 2 year old Golden Retriever rescue pup home.  Both my wife and I had grown up with large dogs so we thought a larger dog might stand a better chance with our growing family of 3 boys, (soon to be 4 boys).

When our 2 older sons and I arrived home with the 140 pound pup, my wife met us with an OMG look of surprise. She was expecting a lot smaller dog. I tried to calm her by telling her that the lady who was rehoming him said that he liked children. She replied to my comment with ""By the size of him, he must like to have 2 chikdren a day!""

The guy says wow, I heard about this happening before but never thought it would happen to me,so, do I get 3 wishes, the genie said no, 32 years ago the economy was good and I could do 3 wishes.

He said in this economy I can only grant one wish, guy said ok, and thought for a minute. The guy said I don't fly or get on cruise ships, so my wish is for a bridge from here to Hawaii, I've always wanted to go there but was no way to get there,so that's my wish.

The genie rubbed his goatee and thought for a minute, then he said sorry sir I can't possibly do that, that's impossible, then the genie said I'll grant you another wish, the guy thought for a minute, then said I want to understand women, you know, what makes them tick.

"The Parrot A guy walks into a pet store and sees a beautiful parrot with a sign that says:

‚ÄúParrot: $25! Speaks multiple languages.‚Äù

He‚Äôs stunned. ‚ÄúWhy so cheap?‚Äù

The store owner sighs.
‚ÄúWell‚Ä¶ he used to live in a brothel. So he swears. A lot.‚Äù

The guy thinks, Eh, I‚Äôve seen worse, and buys the bird.

He gets home, sets the cage up, and the parrot looks around and says:

‚ÄúNew joint. Nice. Hey sugar, what do you charge?‚Äù

The guy laughs it off.

An hour later, his daughters get home from school. The parrot says:

‚ÄúWell well well. Fresh talent. You girls work weekdays?‚Äù

They scream. He explains. Everyone calms down.

That night, his wife walks in.

"So I was sitting on the bus just reading a book when somebody tapped me on the shoulder. I turned around and saw an old lady. She said to me, ""Sonny, would you like some nuts? I've got a couple hazelnuts and almonds if you'd like.""

""Sure."", I replied. Then she gave me a handful of nuts and went back to sit with her friends.

""What a nice lady"", I thought, while happily munching on the nuts.

A few minutes later, I felt another tap on my shoulder and there she was again, offering some nuts. I gladly accepted and she went back to her seat.

After about 10 minutes, she tapped me on the shoulder, once again offering some nuts.

I asked her, ""Why don't you eat them yourself?""

"Modern science One day Bill complained to his friend that his elbow really hurt. His friend suggested that he go to a computer at the drugstore that can diagnose anything quicker and cheaper than a doctor.

""You put in a sample of your urine and the computer will diagnose your problem and tell you what you can do about it. It only costs $10."" Bill figured he had nothing to lose, so he filled a jar with a urine sample and went to the drugstore.

Finding the computer, he poured in the sample and deposited the $10. The computer started making some noise and various lights started flashing. After a brief pause out popped a small slip of paper on which was printed:
You have tennis elbow. Soak your arm in warm water. Avoid heavy lifting. It will be better in two weeks."" 

Later that evening while thinking how amazing this new technology was and how it would change medical science forever, Bill began to wonder if this machine could be fooled. He mixed together some tap water, a stool sample from his dog and urine samples from his wife and daughter. To top it off, he masturbated into the concoction.

He went back to the drug store, located the machine, poured in the sample and deposited the $10. The computer again made the usual noise and printed out the following message:

""Your tap water's too hard. Get a water softener. Your dog has worms. Get him vitamins. Your daughter's using cocaine. Put her in rehab. Your wife's pregnant with twin girls. They aren't yours.
Get a lawyer.
And if you don‚Äôt stop jerking off you‚Äôre going to have tennis elbow.‚Äù",post,r/Jokesuncensored,Comedy,20.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokesuncensored/comments/1km7ogs/modern_science/

"Bob was excited about his new .338 rifle and decided to try bear hunting. He traveled up to Alaska, spotted a small brown bear and shot it. Soon after there was a tap on his shoulder, and he turned around to see a big black bear. The black bear said, ‚ÄúThat was a very bad mistake. That bear is my cousin, I‚Äôm going to give you two choices. Either I maul you to death or we have sex.‚Äù After considering briefly, Bob decided to accept the latter alternative. So the black bear had his way with Bob.

Even though he felt sore for two weeks, Bob soon recovered and vowed revenge. He headed out on another trip to Alaska where he found the black bear and shot it dead. Right after, there was another tap on his shoulder. This time a huge grizzle bear stood right next to him. The grizzly said, ‚ÄúThat was a big mistake, Bob. That bear was my cousin and you‚Äôve got two choices- either I maul your to death or we have rough sex.‚Äù Again, Bob thought it was better to co-operate with the grizzly bear than be mauled to death. So the grizzly had his way with Bob.

Although he survived, it took several months before Bob fully recovered. Now Bob was completely outraged, so he headed back to Alaska and managed to track down the grizzly bear and shot it. He felt sweet revenge, but then moments later, there was a tap on his shoulder, He turned around to find a giant polar bear standing there. The polar bear looked at him and said,

"Morning Train On a crowded morning train, a bodybuilder pushes through the crowd, comes near to a 
chubby man and whispers in his ear:
- ""I f**ked your wife!"", and went on.

The next day, the scene repeats itself.When this happened on the third day,
the man, having arrived from work, tells his wife  visibly excited what has been happening to him on the train for several days now. The wife  advises him:
- ""Let the idiot go, don't let yourself be provoked by some half-drunk fools.
Ignore him and he'll stop!""

The next day, the train is full again,and the bodybuilder again pushes himself towards the man, approaches him and silently and discretly whispers on his ear:

"Poop and heartbeats I read a scientific article about the heart rate and lifespan of most mammals being inversely related. The short-lived animals have fast heartbeats, and the long lived ones have slow heartbeats. But this means that the product of heart rate and lifespan = total heartbeats over the whole life span, is fairly constant across mammals! Turns out, most mammals have about a billion heartbeats in them.

The exception is humans, where the number is  2 to 2.5 billion heartbeats.

Now, in a separate scientific article, I read that most mammals finish their pooping in about 20 seconds.

Again, the exception is western humans, who take anywhere from 10 minutes to 30 minutes.

"This has become my favorite Subreddit. #DadLevelRising I just wanted to say that I really enjoy being a part of this community. It keeps me groaning every day and inspires me to help others keep groaning as well. I love that everyone can contribute to each other's posts and where in other communities, what would be considered ""hijacking"" someone's post, is occurring in EVERY  post and is a part of the culture here. It is rather rad(dad). Keeping that dad energy alive is a team effort. Working together and being creative, at the cost of those who might groan, is key to our victory and must be uplifted at all costs! (The more, the nightmerrier!)

"I heard this joke, but it deserves a better title. A pedophile victim survives the trauma and becomes a comedian.  He gets really popular, but he can't tell his best joke because it is about when he was sexually assaulted as a child, and he doesn't want to put his audience through that, but he knows it is a really funny joke and he really wants to tell it.

Eventually he dies and goes to heaven.  He is walking around and he gets to meet God on the first day.  He realizes that this is his chance to tell his best joke, so he tells God his best joke.

""That's not funny,"" says God.

""I guess you had to be there,"" says the comedian.

"The bikini is actually named after the Bikini Atoll (where the US government conducted atomic bomb testing after the end of the Second World War) by French designer Louis R√©ard in 1946. The atom bomb tests were fresh in the minds of the general public at the time, making sure that the name was just about as attention grabbing as the swimsuit itself. The fact that ""Bikini"" includes ""bi-"" in the spelling is likely coincidence",comment_5,r/Unclejokes,Comedy,,https://www.reddit.com/r/Unclejokes/comments/1kh76ag/why_was_the_two_piece_bikini_created/
