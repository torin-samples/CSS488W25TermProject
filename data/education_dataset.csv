"Can Trump’s Political Brawn Really Take Down Harvard’s Brains? https://www.thedailybeast.com/can-trumps-political-brawn-really-take-down-harvards-brains/

I profoundly disagree with the notion in this article that Harvard has suffered reputational damage. On the contrary: Harvard is standing as a beacon of academic freedom, intellectual rigor, and global engagement amid a concerted populist and financial onslaught.

America’s universities are respected not because they conform, but because they challenge; not because they echo orthodoxy, but because they foster free thought and create new knowledge. Attacks like this aren’t evidence of failure—they’re a testament to the enduring strength and relevance of institutions committed to truth and learning.",post,r/education,Education,24.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/education/comments/1kubwgc/can_trumps_political_brawn_really_take_down/
"I think people vastly underestimate the power the Trump administration has. I'm not saying this is a done deal, but it looks like they really do have the power to do whatever they want, regardless of what the law says. It makes fights like this all the more important. They are going to openly break the law every day that they remain in power, and as much power as they have, thats going to cause controversy and cost political capital as long as there are powerful forces to oppose them. If they can strongarm everyone into just complying they can basically be as lawless as they want with no limits",comment_1,r/education,Education,,https://www.reddit.com/r/education/comments/1kubwgc/can_trumps_political_brawn_really_take_down/
Taking away their international students and taxing their endowment returns seems draconian and unfair. Like nobody believes their argument that that Harvard is actually “fostering violence” and “coordinates with the China communist party”.  It seems like a preposterous argument to carry out a vendetta.,comment_2,r/education,Education,,https://www.reddit.com/r/education/comments/1kubwgc/can_trumps_political_brawn_really_take_down/
"True, Trump ""is a brand"", but Harvard's brand goes back much, much farther and is pretty much unblemished, whereas Trump has a less than 50% approval rating at this point. 

His attempt to get rid of international students is definitely ""on brand"".  He wants to rid the US of anyone who isn't ""us"" -- American born white people.

"Climate denial has crippled climate communication and has had negative influence on climate education. The science of climate change has done just fine against climate denialism, and the science has only grown stronger over time. The problem has been that a glaring gap has opened between scientific knowledge and public audience perception of that knowledge (and the scientific consensus). A large portion of the public audiences has this issue, which can negatively affect all aspects of climate education, as school boards, teachers and parents may suffer from the consensus gap. As the energy-industrial complex has poured millions of dollars into PR firms to promote its propaganda against the scientific consensus, climate denial has crippled climate communication and has had negative influence on climate education.

"I cheated on my exam and got caught I have absolutely no excuse for what I did because it's wrong no matter what I say. I only have my reasons and absolute regret for what I've done. 

For context I, a grade 11 student cheated on my math test.

 I entered a prestigious university in my country that offers school for senior high school students. It's one of the ""big four"" universities here and getting in is a big deal. Usually students like me take this route where we take our grade 11-12 here to get an advantage in getting into its college courses. I feel as if I just got very lucky while taking the entrance exam to get into this school 

 And I sincerely apologize for my harsh language but I was not prepared for how hard as fuck it actually would be to study there. Most people get low grades no matter how many sleepless nights spent studying. I've seen classmates and students break down because most of the time what was taught and studied didn't quite exactly show up on the test and fail which gives them a low grades for the first time.

 the type of professors you get can even determine your grade. There are professors who give harder than usual quizes and exams or are stricter than necessary compared to other classes teachers. This results in other classes getting lower grades compared to others with more... tame professors. Sometimes it even feels like the teachings is for college students and not highschoolers with how distressingly hard it is to even comprehend. 

I've even encountered a professor who genuinely screwed us up when studying pre calculus as he was more used to college level teaching and often skipped on important details and steps while solving as if he already expected us to know. I passed only with the bare minimum grade and it was thanks to me studying online through youtube which was genuinely easier to understand compared to my professor...

I used to be a person who always studies hard. I've never had a bad grade in my life and I've always surrounded my worth with my academics so surviving school with barely passing grades broke me and led me to a extreme burn out when I felt like no matter what I do this was all I can be and that im an absolute failure so I stopped studying for my subjects and just went through the motions.

Fast forward its the second term and im on the verge of repeating a math subject. Its the last term of the school year and apart from disappointing my parents they would have to pay for summer classes just so I can level up to grade 12 if I fail. I was so scared of the thought of it especially the guilt and disappointment that would come when my parents who work so hard just so they can afford sending me to this school which im failing in find out. During the day before the exam I accidentally fell asleep while reviewing and when I woke up there was no more time to review anymore. I panicked so hard because I hadn't memorized the rest of the formulas or even reviewed half of the process yet because my dumb lazy ass put of reviewing until the very last day before the exams. This was all my fault I should have been more responsible and less careless. I should have reviewed more. 

 This lead me to panicking so much I tried to cheat for the first time in my life. Cheating here is actually very rampant and very normalized because of how hard it is to pass. students would share answers on the rare times professors would give online tests, copy off each other, use unauthorized cheat sheets and even use their phones discreetly. I've seen a lot of my classmates do this and they've never been caught and thats where I got the idea to write down formulas on a piece of paper to look at from time to time and even use my phone to get answers.

It all turned to shit when the proctor stopped to look at our row. At that time I was using my phone and panicked and hid it by closing my legs as I hid it between. I was so focused on the phone I forgot to hide my sheet full of formulas. The proctor saw and quickly grabbed it and saw the formulas written down. I quickly got my test papers taken and eventually my phone got found out too. When my professor who taught us the subject was notified of the incident she was so mad and had a one on one talk with me explaining my consequences and what would happen which was basically me getting a zero which I frankly deserve. 

Seeing her angry face made me feel so much shame and guilt. She was actually one of the rare professors that I genuinely like and look up to. She even helped me get a higher grade in the 1st quarter of my second term when I begged her if she can round off my grade. She even likes to joke around with me during classes and we sometimes talk outside class. It's my dumb mistake that I disappointed her and lost her trust now I don't know how to face her on grade consultation day. I really should have been a better person and just accepted what my would have grade been if I just took the test honestly. I have done something unfair to my fellow students. Now I get an even worse outcome. My parents got notified although I told them first as I felt it was the right thing to do. And apart from failing and having to repeat I now get a record for academic dishonesty. My school tales cheating very seriously compared to other schools. For highschoolers consequences are generally more lenient compared to colleges when it comes to cheating. However as I've said my school as it has a big reputation is very serious about these kinds of things compared to other schools I have asked around and there are cases where you can get expelled. Expulsion can also happen. It really depends on the case they said and I can't help but be nervous. 

 I hope as a first time offender getting expelled or an expulsion doesn't happen. I probably deserve it but despite me wanting to own up to my actions its the two is the thing I cant afford to get. 

I genuinely should have been a better person and thought about my actions and its consequences 

But moving on has anyone here been caught or handled such matters? How should I go on about it? Im not going to ask for a lighter punishment or ask to retake it because I know I don't deserve it especially if cheating was the first thought I had to challenges such as these. What would happen to me in the future if I keep it up? I've thought about it and it only show's my laziness and bad character. I really want to apologize to my professor but I have no idea how to go about it. I just need tips on how to gracefully handle this situation. I'll accept my punishments but most importantly I would like to know what I can say to my professor as I deeply feel so much guilt. I don't even know if I can face them or if I should even do so. I won't ever do what I did ever again its never worth it. You don't even get anything out of it in the long run. I'll take it as a lesson learned and try to improve myself. Maybe this was a wake up call for me and my declining behavior.",post,r/education,Education,0.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/education/comments/1kuezsy/i_cheated_on_my_exam_and_got_caught/
"Just own up to it. Tell your professor that you made a huge mistake and that what you want is not a better grade but an opportunity for a little redemption. You obviously feel bad about it, and being up front and owning that mistake would mean so much more to me as your teacher. We educators know that you are still a child and that you will make mistakes. What we hope is that there will be discussion around how you will change your behavior.

"Your school probably has academic integrity policies about how they handle academic integrity violations. 

Consequences for a first-time violation can vary depending on the egregiousness of the cheating. 

Read all emails sent to you about your violation. Read and reread them slowly and thoroughly so that your feelings don't interfere with your understanding. 

If there's a formal review and an opportunity to share your reasons for cheating, participate in these willingly. Express your remorse and personal shame. Talk about what steps you will take in the future to give yourself a better understanding of course material so that you aren't tempted to cheat.

"Big Beautiful Bill and the Education impacts as it stands.  Hint it’s bad I ran the bill all (1001 pages) through AI and then checked out the sections myself.   It’s really scary what it does for students let alone everything else in this stupid corrupt bill.

-how the bill effects Education-

1.	⁠Restriction of Federal Student Aid Eligibility •	Section 30001: Limits eligibility to U.S. citizens, lawful permanent residents, and select humanitarian parolees (e.g., Cubans, Ukrainians). •	Excluded: Undocumented students, DACA recipients, and most non-resident immigrants.

Impact: •	Shuts out marginalized groups from federal support. •	Forces them toward predatory private loans—or out of higher education altogether.

⸻

2. Elimination of Subsidized Loans for Undergraduates •	Section 30011(a): Ends subsidized loans (which don’t accrue interest while in school) beginning July 2026. •	Students must rely entirely on unsubsidized loans—interest starts immediately.

Impact: •	A typical borrower with $30K in loans could owe $3K+ more over 10 years. •	Hits low-income and first-gen students the hardest.

⸻

3. Termination of Graduate and Parent PLUS Loans •	Section 30011(b): •	Ends Graduate PLUS Loans starting July 2026. •	Restricts Parent PLUS Loans unless a dependent student has maxed out their own aid.

Impact: •	Graduate students are pushed into high-interest private loans. •	Families with limited resources lose a key tool to support college-going children.

⸻

4. Tying Aid to “Median Program Cost” •	Section 30002: Caps student aid based on the median cost of the program type (e.g., liberal arts vs. engineering).

Impact: •	Undermines high-cost, high-value degrees like medicine or STEM. •	May encourage schools to lower program quality to avoid aid limits.

⸻

Long-Term Impacts •	Widening Inequality: Low-income and marginalized students lose viable pathways to higher education. •	Worsening Debt Divide: Wealthier students avoid loans; others drown in interest. •	Talent Shortages: Reduced access to STEM and healthcare degrees weakens national competitiveness.

Controversies •	Equity Concerns: ~450,000 undocumented students graduate U.S. high schools annually—nearly all would be excluded. •	Economic Backfire: College grads contribute $1.2M+ in lifetime tax revenue. Cutting access undermines future growth.",post,r/education,Education,235.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/education/comments/1kt44jp/big_beautiful_bill_and_the_education_impacts_as/

"Starting Special Education Focused Tutoring — Need Opinions! Hi everyone,

I’m Kayla, and I’m excited to share that I’m launching a small, personalized 1-on-1 tutoring business for children in Kindergarten through Grade 6. I’d really appreciate your feedback on my approach, especially around pricing, lesson ideas, and ensuring I’m staying ethical in my practice.

I have a background in psychology (BA with major in psych) and have hands-on experience in special education. I’ve also worked as a supply Educational Assistant and supply Early Childhood Educator in public, Catholic, and private schools. While I do offer academic support in reading, writing, and math, my true passion is helping kids develop social-emotional skills and life skills that are so critical these days.

Since COVID, I’ve seen firsthand how many children struggle with emotional regulation, building friendships, and managing day-to-day routines. There’s a clear need in my local community for support that goes beyond academics, so my sessions focus on, academic tutoring (Reading, Writing, Math), Social-emotional learning, life skills & executive function coaching, focus & attention support (using ADHD-informed strategies), and special interest exploration & project-based learning.

In my sessions, I tailor everything to the unique needs of each child—whether that’s working on school subjects, building social skills, or exploring passions like art, space, or animals through creative projects.

A few things I’d love some input on:

Pricing: I’m considering starting at $50 per hour. Does this sound reasonable for someone with my background (keeping in mind I’m not a licensed therapist)?

Lesson Ideas: I’m incorporating art, storytelling, and interactive activities to teach social-emotional skills and executive functioning. If you have any favorite resources or strategies for working with this age group, I’d love to hear about them.

Ethical Considerations: I always make it clear that my sessions are educational and supportive—not clinical therapy. I include a disclaimer stating that I’m not a licensed therapist. Any advice on how to maintain transparency and ethical practice is very welcome.

Thank you for taking the time to read my post! I really want to create a tutoring service that is thoughtful, warm, and genuinely helpful to kids and families.",post,r/education,Education,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/education/comments/1ktp58w/starting_special_education_focused_tutoring_need/
"Hi Kayla! 

What you're doing sounds amazing and so needed right now. $50/hour is a fair starting rate given your background and the level of personalized support you offer. You could also try offering small packages to encourage regular sessions. Your use of art, storytelling, and hands-on activities is perfect—kids learn best that way. Try things like social stories, fun emotion games, or mini projects based on their interests. Ethically, you’re already on the right track. Just keep being clear that it’s educational, not therapy, and have a simple disclaimer and boundaries in place.

Reading via internet or textbook? Which method will be effective internet or textbook?

"From my experience as an art director who specified type and a marketing communications manager concerned with website content, the effectiveness of reading comprehension is dependent on a lot of different factors. This goes for both online reading and textbooks.

1. Typography: Line length, typeface, the leading between lines, and space between letters make a big difference in reading comprehension. So, note that the first line of your comment has 110 characters, and the space between the lines is significant. The same applies to the Tom Clancy novel I am currently reading. But since I am reading your comment via my browser, my browser determines the effectiveness of my reading because each browser has to choose from a limited number of typefaces and type specifications that exist on your computer. What you see in your browser may not be the same in mine.

I have the Rokuten Kobo application on my computer that I use to buy online books. It has the ability to change the font, type size, line length, and line spacing to fit my tastes and comprehension.

2. Illumination. Books and computers have different illumination factors.  One is reflective, the other projected. Glare, brightness, and screen contrast play a big role in what you can read on a computer screen. One of the places I worked as a marketing manager was a commercial shade manufacturer, and I had to create a piece on how visibly transparent roller shades improved the ability to read computer screens in schools, and how they didn't have the problems created by vertical or horizontal blinds. Our shades, when fully down, allowed a view through the shade while protecting the computer screen from being wiped out by the sun. I am sure all of you know how difficult it is to read your smartphones outdoors in the sun.

3. Interactivity. As the creator of MyReadingMapped, I designed to create an environment that enables you to experience history and science for yourself; that experience is the best teacher of all. Being able to digitally walk the path of a famous expedition or walk around an ancient ruin gives you a better understanding of events than a textbook can. Plus, it breaks up the content into small digestible chunks. Check it out for yourself athttps://climateviewer.org/history-and-science/

4. Interconnectivity.  While reading my Tom Clancy novel, one of the things I do is search for all the locations in the book in Google Earth because I want to see the actual location to better understand the environment the action takes place. It is similar to what you can do with MyReadingMapped, where you can read  The Travels of Marco Polo and trace the events in a 3D satellite map, page referenced, and quotes from the book.

5. Imagery. Having been a graphic designer, I know how important it is to place photos, illustrations, and charts in the right locations in the text. Whether reading a book or online, it is valuable to do an image search of what you just read. You can learn so much more by seeing a wide variety of images on the topic.",comment_2,r/education,Education,,https://www.reddit.com/r/education/comments/1kteveu/reading_via_internet_or_textbook/

"I graduated HS in ‘12. I understand the struggle with significant life events impeding your academic progress. I had to drop out of semesters multiple times because of multiple deaths in the family (large immigrant family with a lot of cousins/aunts/uncles etc).

I think one of the best things I did for myself was transfer from my original community college to a different community college farther from home. I was forced to because I had multiple withdrawals and couldn’t take those classes anymore. At my lowest point, I just forced myself to talk to counselor about what my options were. And from there I retook those classes and over the years was able to transfer to university where I maintain a 3.8 gpa with a bunch of extracurriculars.

As an older student, you have to accept that people you know in your life are also getting older. You just have to cherish the time you have with them even more. And when they’re gone, you carry them memory of them with you and have that add to the drive you need to succeed.

You need to talk to people to succeed. One of the ways I’ve dealt with my own anxieties is just becoming so ingrained in the topics that I study, that they eventually become my strengths and armor. I’ll be in a place and rather than recoil and internalize, I actively just write down the focal points and review. Though at this point, this is just myself talking about what I do for research prep and when I have to talk to my faculty advisors. Sometimes I’ll feel like I don’t know anything in my major. So the best friend that I made these past few years are books in the library. Rather than just googling the topic, I made it a habit to use google scholar and just find an intro text book to immerse myself.

Basically, making myself as comfortable as possible makes me more fluid in the information and I am able to say the things I wanted rather than shirk infront of others. Just be honest in your efforts, the world is always moving and it’ll be unforgiving for everyone.

"Yep. Doing the bare minimum required by the contract and nothing more. 

I leave at exactly 3:30 (I will literally walk out on my admin speaking). Don't volunteer for anything. Refuse to look at emails or phone calls outside work hours. And don't do anything extra or how my admin like to phrase it, 'fail forward' (ie go above and beyond a la Instagram teachers). 

I show up. Do my job. And leave.

Don't get me wrong, I love the kids and love teaching, but I was so severely taken advantage of my first few years teaching (I honestly believe I'm owed about $16k with all the 'extra' stuff I did my first few years) that once I got tenure and established myself, I put my foot down and stopped putting up with the bullshit.

"Concern About Catholic Schools Hi there,

I’m currently exploring school options for my child and came across one catholic school near our home that I really like. It seems to offer a safe environment, small class sizes, and strong academic performance—qualities that are very important to our family.

That said, I do have a question about the religious component of the curriculum. We are Orthodox Christians, and while we respect all faith traditions, we believe our child should have the freedom to explore spiritual questions independently, without being formally taught specific religious beliefs in school.

With that in mind, I wanted to ask: is it possible for students to opt out of religious classes, Mass, or school-led prayers if a family prefers a more neutral approach to faith instruction?",post,r/education,Education,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/education/comments/1kta8r1/concern_about_catholic_schools/
"Here’s what I can tell you about Catholic schools in the US. I imagine it could look very different in other countries. 

I would guess that up to 50% of students at Catholic schools in the US aren’t Catholic. Unlike other religiously-affiliated schools, where the families are seeking a specifically religious education, Catholic schools are popular among families of many different religious traditions for all the reasons you cited: small class size, safe environment, strong academics.

It’s very unlikely they would allow you to opt out of any school activities. In a logistical level, they would need to provide alternate supervision or classrooms for students opt out of Mass or religion class, and they just won’t have the resources for that. For philosophical reasons, most schools are going to want students to participate in all aspects of school life. It’s sort of like, you knew what you were signing up for when you enrolled, so you’re expected to be okay with it enough that your kid can sit quietly and respectfully, even if they don’t participate actively. 

At the elementary level, you’re probably going to see a lot more of “teaching religious beliefs,” sort of like a Sunday school class. But they won’t ever be expected to actually *believe* what they’re being taught. So they might need to answer a question like, “What do Catholics believe is important about Jesus’s mother, Mary?” But they won’t ever have to answer a question like, “Do you believe that Mary conceived Jesus by the power of the Holy Spirit?” with one right answer (“Yes”) in mind. 

One of the aspects that I love most about working in a Catholic school is that our students *do* get the opportunity to explore spiritual questions—much more so than at a public school! I wish all high school students could learn about world religions, regardless of their own stance on religion, because it’s such an important part about understanding humanity and society. 

You can definitely talk to the admissions people about your concerns; I’m sure they get this kind of question a lot! But I do think it would be very unusual if they allowed for opting out of anything that happens as part of the student experience.",comment_1,r/education,Education,,https://www.reddit.com/r/education/comments/1kta8r1/concern_about_catholic_schools/

"Memory retention and taking notes over or within illustrations (?) I've a read quite a bit on how hand-writing notes while learning a new topic helps with memory retention by activating more regions of the brain simultaneously. 

I was just getting my clipboard ready for some note taking and had to first remove some coloring book illustrations. This gave me an idea that writing notes directly over uncolored coloring book pages or other illustrations might help create stronger mental connections to the notes.

I'm curious if anyone is aware of studies related to this, or even anecdotal evidence. It seems like it would work similar to memory palace retention where visualizing facts relative to other visualized objects makes stronger connections.

"There seems to be a disconnect between what these parents are wanting and what the actual processes are. You do have to look at how students are performing compared to their peers in order meet eligibility for an educational diagnosis. If all the kids in a class are struggling with the same concept, then you have to look at all the factors that are impacting that. Conversely, if a kid was previously diagnosed with a learning disability and outperforming their peers, that’s an indication that a kid needs less supports, not more. Some kids will progress out of their IEPS, and that’s a good thing! 

Some more local context: Lincoln is essentially a magnet school that kicks kids out if they score below a B; a kid struggling there isn’t necessarily an indicator of a disability.

Adding to that is the confusion between state laws. Identification criteria is different in Kansas and Missouri. The biggest difference is that a medical diagnosis doesn’t automatically guarantee an IEP in Missouri like it does in Kansas (KS teachers, correct me if I’m wrong), and kids in the KC area bounce between both states. Dyslexia isn’t even a special education category in Missouri; it’s broken up into categories under the umbrella of Specific Learning Disability.",comment_1,r/education,Education,,https://www.reddit.com/r/education/comments/1ksqnll/dyslexia_is_common_but_these_kcarea_parents_had/

"Starting new job Hi, Not sure how to approach this one. I have worked in education around 5 years now. I know how to present and handle myself as well speak to students and handle their behaviour infact I got on quite well in my previous job because of how well I got on with staff and students and thought it would now be awsome to work closer to home because the opportunity came up. 

I started the new role and I am dealing with student conversations etc but I just have that weird feeling that I am someone that isn't trusted. Like today I handled a conversation well with 3 difficult students obviously leading in with a conversation to get me into trouble and I spotted this a mile away and steered away their interest to have a more positive discussion. However this member of staff came over to move them along as they felt I was being led into a difficult spot evnthough explaining to them that I knew that and was trying to steer it into a more positive discussion. 

I just feel now akward like I have done something wrong eventhough I haven't which is so sad to be honest. It also makes me feel slightly like I am not welcome either and that I am unable to handle myself which is the complete opposite of the situation. I spoke to my line manager about it and he doesn't seem to be that concerned about the encounter because if he was then he would have told me that I was doing something wrong. 

How do I actually approach this so that people understand that I am not just someone new to education and that I can handle myself? I can understand that teachers can look out for one another but it just looks like I am being weak and need a member of staff to back me up all the time and the students are recognising this.

"How to deal with a verbally abusive person? Hello Everyone:

Hope you all are doing well and that your spring semester ended well for you if you are teaching.

I am a full time professor who teaches Communication Studies online and I absolutely love it. I have always received great reviews and have been awarded for my teaching excellence numerous times each year and I have taught for 10 plus years.

I am a young woman professor in my mid 30s with a vision impairment and a hearing disability (I wear hearing aids) to provide a little context. It’s definitely clearly visible and sadly I do experience discrimination.

In addition to being a professor, I also teaching one or two technology classes a month at my local community center, each class is between 1-2 hours. I teach to those 65 and up. I love it. The seniors that I work with love when I come teach classes to them and are so thankful. They are awesome.

Well, here is the issue. Last July I had taught a class and there was a husband and a wife in there who couldn’t have been more rude if they tried. Before I could even start the class they asked “what makes you so qualified to teach this class” “Are you even smart”. They pretty much interrupted me continuously and even whispered “yeah right she is a professor with a doctorate degree, how can that be” They also mocked my speech impediment that I have. It was probably the worst class experience I have ever had in my ten years of teaching adults. Keep in mind these two individuals were at least 70 or so, heck my college students act more mature then they did. I know, right?

A month after that class they sent a long email to my administrator at the community center and pretty much said some very cruel and derogatory things about me, such as that I am not smart and knowledgeable and they also said so many other hurtful things that just made me burst into tears when I read it. Luckily my administrator was on my side and couldn’t have been more supportive when I told her all that happened.

I continued to teach at my community center and receive highly regarded reviews as I did in all my classes. I never had anything like this at all.

A few days ago I taught a class at my community center and the woman who had took my class back in July with her husband decided to sign up to take my class solo. She showed up and right from the start she was verbally abusive like she was back in July. She asked me questions that had nothing to do with the class and she wanted more of an advance class when it was a basic class. I was kind and told her that I was very sorry I could not answer her question as it was way beyond what the class was covering. She became so outraged and I tried all that I could to calm her down. I tried offering some more advance classes she could take and even suggested she write the recommendations down on the class feedback sheet. She left the sheet blank and left in a rage. I received great reviews from the other members in the class who as you can imagine were not comfortable with how the woman acted and even spoke up about it.

I found out this morning from my administrator that the woman went to the front desk at my community center right after she left the room in a rage and pretty much said to the staff that she didn’t get what she wanted and that I didn’t answer her questions which was a lie, I spent more time trying to help her if anything, especially calming her down when she got verbally abusive with me. She told the desk she wanted to remain anonymous but didn’t even want her money back when they asked if she did which was bizarre. You would think she would, right?

My administrator again was apologetic that this woman did this twice to me, she was going to call her and give her and nip it in the butt. She told me to not be afraid to get someone when that happens and to call them out. The only thing is, I am younger than they are, calling them out would make things worse. She did also say that she will make sure that the woman and her husband don’t take my class again, let’s hope not!

She did mention too that people see that I have a disability and am young and they like to take advantage of it.  I have face discrimination in the past but not as bad as this, it seems this woman is out to get me for whatever reason. I am curious, if you are an educator with a disability, have you ever been discriminated against? How do you handle it? I do pretty well and am resilient and keep going but it is hard I’ll be honest. I shouldn’t have to fear being discriminated against but it does happen on a yearly basis.

What would you have done in this situation if a student became verbally abusive and hostile towards you? I just hope I handled this situation right. It really made me scared about how this person acted and I am just really worried she will confront me at the community center or out in public. I know I shouldn’t worry and I am so sorry for saying this but I truly think this woman would do this, I am worried she is going to contact all the colleges I teach at as a professor and make sure I lose my job even though I am pretty sure my deans and associate deans would all hang up on her and not give her the time or day. I am sorry for sounding stupid for saying this, I just think she is the type of woman to do this, trust me, you would think the same thing.

Thank you all so much for your advice and support. I love teaching more than the world. The thing about me is, I may be a teacher with a disability but I am resilient and will fight through this like I always do. If anything, it is situations like this that make me continue to love teaching.

"Yes, educated people make mistakes and can do unethical things. There’s a phrase I like that “science always leaves room for error” because scientists need to adapt their theories if the evidence is against them. 

The primary goal of education is not teach you how to be a good person—it’s to teach you essential skills (reading, math) and facts about the world (history, geography, etc.). Many educated people are decent—some are despicable. 

Humanity and empathy, in my view, is more shaped by spending time with many types of people and learning that they aren’t so different from you.

"Teacher Keeps Making My 10-Year-Old Cry—Afraid to Speak Up. Advice Parents, I need your advice. My 10-year-old daughter, who’s in 5th grade in KC Missouri, has been having a really tough time at school. Her teacher has been consistently mean to her all year, making her cry multiple times by belittling her and making fun of her in front of the class. It’s heartbreaking. We haven’t reached out to the teacher or administration yet because we’re worried about potential retaliation. In the past, when our daughter faced a bullying incident, the principal tried to downplay it and didn’t take meaningful action. We’re concerned the same thing might happen again, and we don’t want things to get worse for our daughter.

What would you do in our shoes? Should we address it directly with the school, or is there another approach that might be more effective? We just want our daughter to feel safe and supported.

Teachers and parents if you don’t think your kids want to learn why are the most popular videos on the internet (after p0rn) science instructional videos?,post,r/education,Education,31.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/education/comments/1kqgmok/teachers_and_parents_if_you_dont_think_your_kids/
"There are very few people in the world who do not want to learn at all. People enjoy knowing stuff.

The issue is that genuine learning - not just memorizing information - requires a lot of effort. And many people balk at putting in that effort, or for various reasons fail to do so. When folks say (if they do) that kids don't want to learn, that is more likely what they mean.

And that is compatible with the popularity of science instructional videos. Turning on a video and passively receiving the information isn't really learning. But it does have the vaneer of learning. It is similar to Plato's comparison between athletics and cosmetics. The former make you actually healthy while the latter make you appear healthier without any of the effort (or real benefits) of the former. Same here - watching an instructional video makes one feel like they have learned and so discharges that desire in the cheapest way possible.

Alternatively, science instructional videos could be especially popular because students use them as a way to get through courses without real learning. They are just watching them in preparation for an exam, for instance, where they will almost immediately forget everything (because that is what cramming does).

So, it seems you think your question is some sort of 'gotcha'. But it is not. It is just a reflection of failing to do any critical thinking... the precise sort of difficult thing many people don't want to invest the time in learning!",comment_1,r/education,Education,,https://www.reddit.com/r/education/comments/1kqgmok/teachers_and_parents_if_you_dont_think_your_kids/

Kids (even smart, engaged kids who *aren't looking for shortcuts*!) do things like use variable names from the example that make zero sense in the problem. They're really not good at abstracting meaning from examples. 

To hook it back to OP's question: a well-explained, engaging video can create a false sense of comprehension. The viewer sees and understands the concept. (that's the point of the video!)

Yawn. Been hearing same shit for years,comment_1,r/education,Education,,https://www.reddit.com/r/education/comments/1kqusvo/our_education_system_was_built_for_a_world_that/
"My take is that the current education system works for some students, and some of the reasons are not part of an individual school.  The ideal of the American public K-12 system is a school in the suburbs.  Part of the funding for a public school is from local property taxes and business taxes.  In a nice suburb there are lots of married couples (both with college educations) who have children.  They help their kids with homework, teach study skills and help their children learn things that the public school teachers don't have time to go into depth with.  The parents are also involved with the PTA and make sure teachers who do a poor job are moved to other schools.  The high property values contribute to good schools, and good schools contribute to high property values.

A school in an inner city often has lots of single parent families, parents who may not have completed high school and few who attended college, less funding from property taxes and business taxes.  Many people rent apartments rather than own homes in a city, and businesses get tax incentives (which sometimes include not paying business taxes towards education).  The parents are typically not involved with the PTA, so a teacher that does a poor job does not get reassigned.

As a general rules there are state level budget cuts to education every year in every state.  In the suburbs schools put forward a property tax levy to offset the budget cuts.  Since good schools contribute to higher property values such property tax levies often pass.  Schools that are not in nice suburbs generally cannot offset budget cuts.

My take is there are structural factors that contribute to a public education system that provides better outcomes for students living in nice suburbs.  For the last 30 years the 'solution' to uneven outcomes is to lower standards so every school meets the lower standards, then to blame systemic racism for the still-present different outcomes.",comment_2,r/education,Education,,https://www.reddit.com/r/education/comments/1kqusvo/our_education_system_was_built_for_a_world_that/

"Teachers Beware of Climate Denial I wrote this peer-reviewed review article especially for science teachers to inform them of the insidious nature of the threat of climate denial in the classroom. Climate-denial organizations (which directly deny aspects of the scientific consensus on climate change) and the related petro-pedagogy groups (which teach that oil is a benefactor to humanity, but say little about the connection of fossil fuels to the climate crisis) have arisen to attempt to interfere with the teaching of the science of climate change in school classrooms. 

This corporate-based propaganda promotes itself as a friend of education to help teachers, parents, and pupils but it is only in schools to promote their profits. By doing so, they are feeding false knowledge to the classroom and are putting students (and everyone else) at risk from climate change.

A frightful aspect of this disinformation from the Energy-Industrial Complex is that teachers must be on guard for their trickery for their maleficence is hidden in a shroud of experts coming to help you and the students.

I wrote this review for you. I hope that you enjoy it, and that it is useful. I would like to hear back from you on your experiences and what you think of the article. Please share it with your colleagues.

"AITAH for telling my friend it is his fault his child failed school? 
TLDR: father with sole custody doesn’t make his daughter go to school or make up her missed work and now he’s mad at the school that she’s failed half of her classes. Again. When he asked me what to do, I told him it was his fault she didn’t go to school and, as a result, didn’t pass her classes. 

I (38F) have been in education for more years than I care to admit. One of my friends consistently allows his (37M) child (15F) to skip school. The child failed half of her classes last year and failed the same number this year. He had the audacity to blame the child. He told her, “see, I told you if you didn’t go to school, you would end up failing.” Then, with 4 days left before summer, he called the school/teachers to see what could be done about her grades. Nothing! Nothing can be done at this point. He’s irate that they won’t help him and his daughter…

He reached out to me for advice, again, and this time I flat out told him that it is his fault she failed. That he is the parent and responsible for making his child go to school. I asked, “Where were you all year long? Why weren’t you checking grades all along? Why didn’t you have the school’s app to track grades? Why didn’t you send the kid to school instead of letting her skip? What consequences were put in place for not going to school and making good grades?” In short, why aren’t you worried about being a parent? Because, if parents aren’t doing their jobs at home, teachers can’t do their job at school. He had a million excuses and never took any responsibility for this outcome.

He wanted to argue, but I pointed out that 1. HE ASKED me for my opinion so I am not giving unsolicited advice and 2. grades were sent home all year long… academic progress letters were sent home multiple times… teachers called you (if you had a working number on file)… teachers emailed (again, if the correct info was available)… data was collected… conferences were held… interventions were put in place… What were YOU doing, my guy???

This is the SECOND year of high school we have had this discussion. (Not to mention the many discussions we had over the course of middle school). I was very gentle about it every other time, but, now that it has happened again, and he blamed her, I just laid it out for him - this is YOUR fault.

He blew up at me, to the point that my boyfriend got involved it was so bad, and now he’s telling our friend group that IATAH for accusing him of letting his daughter fail school. I had screenshots so when they started in on me, I just replied with those so they could see that part of the conversation in black and white. The majority of our friends agree with me, but the ones who don’t are incredibly vocal and now I am starting to question my professional and personal judgement. AITAH? (Either way, I am fairly certain our friendship is over, and that is okay with me).

Some questions you may have: He has sole custody and mom has every other weekend visitation. He pretty much always lets her do whatever she wants because he doesn’t want her to go live with her mom full time. He’s obsessed with being the parent she chooses. And, to be honest, I now believe some control issues (having mom at his will) are playing into this behavior as well. I don’t know why mom doesn’t have custody - other than what he has told me, which may or may not be true - and I don’t know if she has the means to take him back to court. The daughter doesn’t have any health issues, mental illnesses, or learning disabilities. They live in the school zone but he insists on driving her to school every morning even though the bus is available. When she asks to stay home, he doesn’t have to get up after his night shift so it’s more convenient for him to not take her. The mother is aware of the situation.

UPDATE: our group chat received the following message, “Just talked to the graduation coach & he said that X is still on track to graduate without any extra intervention like Saturday/Summer School. He will be working with her over the next 2 years to make sure she does graduate on time. He assured me that right now there is no need to worry about her not graduating.  She does have to pass for the next 2 years. He also set her up with counseling for missing school.”

I hope this is true, but I really have no way of knowing. I do know 6 failed academic classes would impact graduation where I teach… I guess only time will tell, but hopefully this helps get them both on track.",post,r/education,Education,131.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/education/comments/1koxj0n/aitah_for_telling_my_friend_it_is_his_fault_his/

"Former Admin/Teacher here:  No, you're not the AH.  Yes, he is in the wrong.  It is a parent's responsibility until the child is 18, they are still their ward.

In today's education, there is zero reason for parents to claim ignorance...as you've already pointed out there's online grading, so keeping an eye on education progress is easier than ever.  Some people are just ALWAYS going to try and pass the buck because they don't want to be accountable to anything.  I don't think you're going to be able to change that.

I'd be willing to bet, looking at other aspect of their lives, he's probably not parenting in other aspects as well.  Never holding their child accountable, teaching life skills, demonstrating responsibility, etc.

"Role AIs like ChatGPT, Lama, DeepSeek or Grok play in the life of a student. A 16 years old student, her assignment is due tomorrow. As a part of her assignment, she was supposed to spend at least a week researching about the subject assigned to her and prepare a manual report as a result. But alas, Now she's barely floating above water. Time to use ChatGPT. 

A student, 21 years old now, as a part of the curriculum, there's a project she is supposed to build on domain of her choice and submit it to the University. 

  
A 22 years old graduate with a resume looking for jobs, a recruiter studies her Resume and wonders if any of these projects are her own or a product of AI? 

For someone who doesn't know who exactly to show or what domain to pick, ChatGPT looks like the only resort. 

With this story, what I'm trying to suggest is - how many of projects/repositories in GitHub can be called your own? 

How many portfolios are actually a hand-made result and how many a product of ChatGPT? (or any AI for that matter)

How are we going to tackle this? Is it really hindering the learning curve of a student? Are AIs really making a student's life easier by literally doing all of their work in minutes?

"Seeking Your Input! Open Source Electronics & Programming Kits + Educational Resources for Middle School and beyond! Hey r/education!

I'm a middle school educator, teaching computer science and pre-engineering. Like many of you, I've found myself frustrated with the existing curriculum and materials available for these subjects. It often feels either too expensive, too closed-off, or just not quite aligned with how I want to teach.
So, I've been working on an idea: to start a company that creates open-source electronics and programming kits specifically designed for engaging middle school (and potentially upper elementary/high school) learners. 

Here's the core concept:
 * Hands-on Learning: The focus would be on affordable, accessible kits that allow students to build and experiment with electronics while learning key programming concepts. Think projects that are fun, relevant, and build a solid foundation.
 * Open Source Hardware & Software: Keeping costs low and fostering community are paramount. The hardware designs and any necessary software would be open source, allowing for transparency, modification, and community-driven improvements.
 * Open Educational Resources (OER): To support these kits, I envision creating open-source educational materials – lesson plans, activities, tutorials – that would be freely available for educators to use, adapt, and even contribute to. My hope is that this collaborative approach could lead to richer, more effective teaching resources for everyone.
 * Community Focus: I want to build a community around these resources, a place where educators can share their experiences, contribute their own lessons, and support each other.
 * Social Media Integration: I'm also keen on leveraging platforms like YouTube, TikTok, Instagram, Facebook, and Reddit to showcase the kits in action, share student projects, and build interest in the educational materials. The goal is to create engaging content that both students and educators can connect with.

Why open source?
For me, it's about:
 * Accessibility: Lowering the financial barrier for schools and homeschool providers.
 * Adaptability: Empowering teachers to modify materials to fit their specific needs and contexts.
 * Collaboration: Creating a space for educators to collectively improve resources.
 * Transparency: Showing how things work under the hood, which is crucial for learning in these fields.
I would absolutely LOVE to get your input on this idea! Specifically, I'm curious about:
 * What are your biggest frustrations with current electronics and programming materials for middle school (or the age groups you teach)?
 * What kinds of projects or concepts do you find most engaging for your students in these areas?
 * What features or support would be most valuable in accompanying educational materials?
 * Do you see value in open-source hardware and software in this context? What are your thoughts on community-driven resources?
 * Where do you typically look for new educational resources and connect with other educators online?
 * Any initial thoughts or concerns about this approach?

I'm really passionate about creating something truly useful for educators and engaging for students. Your insights would be incredibly valuable as I move forward with planning this venture.

Thanks in advance for your time and feedback!",post,r/education,Education,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/education/comments/1kpp5uo/seeking_your_input_open_source_electronics/
"Someone has done a great job of changing the meaning of “balanced literacy” to exclusively stand for whole language instruction I really need someone who has an understanding of the current political situation about reading instruction to explain this to me. 

I am a teacher who grew up with whole language instruction and sat there not learning how to read until someone realized. Then I worked with a reading specialist for a couple of months in 1st grade, learned phonics, and was off on my way. 

This experience matches my understanding of how this works from my masters in elementary education where I learned that you teach kids phonics in k-2, then you increase the reading level through strategies and leveled readers combined with diverse language rich read aloud texts and student choice books. 

This was called “balanced literacy” and it never suggested you don’t teach kids phonics. It said you teach them phonics in early elementary, and if they don’t pick it up, they need to work with an interventionist to identify whatever specific issue is keeping them from learning phonics. 

I received a masters degree in elementary education in the last decade, but I teach high school, so I am baffled by what seems to me to be people who think we need to teach kids phonics all the way through secondary. Like, okay, if for some reason kids didn’t learn word pieces, I can understand working with particular kids in secondary who may need that intervention. If I had to sit through phonics in 4th grade, I would have absolutely died of boredom since I learned it in 1st grade. There are only so many word pieces. 

I’m not trying to convince any one of anything. I am just trying to understand how I got a masters degree which proclaimed the benefits of “balanced literacy” which strongly advocated for heavy phonics instruction and people are enraged about “balanced literacy” not teaching kids phonics. 

It seems like someone quietly changed the terminology with the purpose of creating confusion and we need to get rid of all of this terminology or we need to let reading specialists define these terms and listen to them. 

Someone please help me understand this.",post,r/education,Education,41.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/education/comments/1kp2wfl/someone_has_done_a_great_job_of_changing_the/
"There's a few things in your post. I agree with a few that are really dependent on your state and local district. 

First, phonics instruction doesn't stop in 2nd grade. It shifts to understanding word parts like prefixes, suffixes, Latin, and Greek roots from 3rd grade to 6th-ish. Even in high school standards, there's pieces of this connected to understanding the etymology of words. 

Balanced Literacy has gotten a bad rep because curricular developers slap the word on their resources without truly having explicit phonics instruction and oral language development. They claim it's ""science of reading"" aligned but use the 3-cueing system (looking at you Wonders 2018). 

Another piece of this is the incredible divide between people like Calkins and Goldenberg. Calkins didn't pay attention to the entire reading rope, Goldenberg says you have to give equal attention to both the word strand and the language strand at all levels of k12 to develop comprehensive readers. Others, specifically Escamilla, claim that Goldenberg is focusing only on the word strand and dismissing the language components, even though he is a leading researcher for English language development. 

There's a lot of finger-pointing, bad sellers, and inability to realize you need both language and word recognition, and people's definitions of the science of reading are so all over the place sometimes people are talking about 2 or 3 completely different things. 

Then who gets the blame? Teachers.",comment_1,r/education,Education,,https://www.reddit.com/r/education/comments/1kp2wfl/someone_has_done_a_great_job_of_changing_the/
"How Balanced Literacy is defined and how it is actually taught in practice are not the same. An entire generation didn’t get sufficient phonics instruction under the banner of Balance Literacy. 

Three cuing is an abomination. 

Leveled readers are not needed at all, it’s possible to jump from decodable readers straight to high quality trade books. (Some “leveled readers” are actually just relabeled trade books, Elephant and Piggy FTW!)

There is a great book called Shifting the Balance by Jan Burkins and Kari Yates that goes into detail how Balanced Literacy became unbalanced.",comment_2,r/education,Education,,https://www.reddit.com/r/education/comments/1kp2wfl/someone_has_done_a_great_job_of_changing_the/
"I completed my elementary education masters at Teachers College in the early 2000s. I was definitely taught that you might point towards phonics cues to help a kid decode text. But much more of the focus was on engaging students in the broader reading experience. I was taught strategies such as looking at the picture and to encourage guessing. A broader strategy which became dubbed balanced literacy. 

The real shift has been learning collectively that these strategies, such as guessing, looking at the pictures, all push kids away from the text. This shift has been dubbed science of reading. 

So there are real differences. The focus on real systematic teaching oh phonemes. One of these is the shift from “letters first to sounds first”. In letters first you teach kids letters, and then… well you are kinda screwed because you are forced into a complicated world of exceptions. Here is the letter “c” sometimes it sounds like K, sometimes like s. Good luck. Sounds first says- here are all 44 sounds (phonemes) and here are the different combinations that make up those sounds. This is just one of the examples of how these broad approaches are different. 

Now there is a real problem in education where something becomes a fad, and particularly in this case - political winds shift and suddenly this is the cool thing. It would be better if we could cool
It on the villains talk. It’s not like kids never learned to read before. As OP stated reading instruction worked for them. (I do think for those of us that lived through these years, do need to collectively reflect on what prevented us from listening to science. While Lucy Calkins is guilty of this error- this really was collective failure). 

That said, it is important to also note the equity angle here. OP was somewhere where their reading challenge was identified, and a targeted response was provided. One of the problems in education is we do know what works- but that is sometimes not the same as what works at scale. 

Much of the balanced literacy approach was to focus on enjoyment, engaging, comprehension- but in many contexts- especially those where black and brown kids went to school- there was such a strong desire to highlight all the great thinking and connections kids were making and glossing over that they weren’t decoding. In places strapped for resources this phonics instruction simply never happened. 

One of the most important shifts is just the focus on decoding. It’s not like balanced literacy said decoding didn’t matter- but it also didn’t put it front and center, and in practice this meant that it was not taught systemically. 

It’s been interesting to watch my own children, separated by 14 years be taught reading so different. My son, by six had plenty of sight words- he even learned to read by a pretty normal age. But never really sounded out words. 

My daughter actually has very few sight words. But she is adept at recognizing phonemic patterns, can blend well, and can really decode.

One other thing, the groups reviewing the literacy resources often do A REALLY BAD job at checking to make it is aligned to the science of reading, including both strands. So, states like Colorado put resources on their approved list that have no business being on it because EdReports gave it a good grade. 

Personally, I prefer the Reading League reviews because they give equal critical attention to both strands and have clear reasons why it does or does not meet the research requirements. 

Plus, the people making the curricular resource choices to pilot or purchase don't critically review the resource or have a deep and wide understanding of how to teach reading, writing, AND language (not just for ELLs but all kids).",comment_5,r/education,Education,,https://www.reddit.com/r/education/comments/1kp2wfl/someone_has_done_a_great_job_of_changing_the/

"Are kids really this brainrotted from TikTok and other social media? Okay, so I teach in higher ed, so I cannot comment for the behaviour of primary or secondary students in the context of education. However, I visited my step-sisters school recently for her violin concert, and it's just... bad. I thought to post here to check whether I am just imagining things, or if it is really this bad.

People always say that every generation thinks the younger generation is getting weird, and is crazier.  But I believe that what I am witnessing of the gen alphas is just completely different from the type of rebellion of my generation (gen z). 

Immediately when I arrived at the concert, I had a girl maybe between 13 and 15 years old scoff at me, and say ""Can I give you a suggestion? Get yourself color-analyzed, the orange jacket looks really bad on you and makes your skin texture look terrible."" I swear, if I spoke to older people like that when I was that age, I would've had my butt whooped, for the lack of a better term.

I spoke to my sister about this. Long story short, many girls in her age group (12-16) are already talking about finding a rich guy to date so they don't have to work. It's that TikTok brainrot ""sprinkle sprinkle"" nonsense (I had to literally search to find out exactly what she was talking about). Likewise, lot's of boys are Tate fans. My sister told me one of her friends is planning to drop out of school the moment she finds an ""older provider man"". 

Kids (not even necessarily 16-year-old teenagers, but kids as young as 10) are obsessed with money, aesthetics, skincare, etc. I had my things at that age too. But it's quite different. I remember that girls from my high school took a job on the side to be able to buy their first luxury purse. Now, everyone is getting themselves into serious debt in the pursuit of this stuff - or worse, doing something at the very least legally questionable on the side.

"Reporting my students’ tik tok accounts I have a private account on tik tok. I have had several students (4th grade) try to follow me but I don’t respond to their requests. I do look at their pages though. I have found very inappropriate videos (them dancing to sexual songs, bullying others, threatening others, wearing inappropriate clothes etc). They also post videos while wearing our school’s shirts so anyone can find them. Is it wrong that I have reported their accounts and have had them banned?

"I think several people in these comments need to wake up. Nothing OP is seeing on TikTok is ""private"". They are not invading anyone's privacy. 

The secondary schools where I have worked during the era of social media have clauses in their codes of conduct about responsible online behavior with consequences for students. It's obviously not the expectation that this would be necessary for elementary school students but I don't see why not. The fact is that from middle school onward most of a student's questionable posts would be probably happening at school anyway. And most importantly colleges scour applicant's social media for questionable stuff. 

Let us not forget that almost every threat to a school today originates online. Kids post fight videos shot in the school bathroom.

"To any U.S. History teachers: How many more presidents do you think could realistically fit into a full school year’s curriculum before you'd have to start skipping some? When I took a high school U.S. History course, we managed to cover all 45 presidents up to that point in fairly good detail by the end of the year. But as time goes on and we continue to live through more history—arguably at a faster pace than in recent memory—the scope of what's considered essential to teach also keeps expanding.

At some point, it seems inevitable that not every era of American history will be covered in significant detail. If that happens, which eras or events do you think would be condensed or cut back to make room? Would it ever become necessary to actually skip over some presidents entirely if, say, we reached 70, 100, or even 150 presidents?",post,r/teachers,Education,41.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Teachers/comments/1kuowac/to_any_us_history_teachers_how_many_more/

There’s 3 things I would suggest. 

1) Seek out opportunities to observe and learn from veteran teachers. Not the ones who are grumpy and mean because they need to retire but can’t let go, but the ones who are experts at their craft and are eager to mentor the next generation. You can learn a lot from observing. 

2) Ask for feedback and don’t get defensive when you receive it. I’ve noticed that a lot of teachers and people in general don’t handle feedback well. Do honest reflection every day and be willing to accept suggestions and feedback without taking it as a personal attack. 

3) Find your own style. There is no cookie cutter classroom management style. You have to take pieces from here and there and mix them with your own style and philosophy. It takes time to figure that out and craft it to what you want it to be. 

You’ll get there. If you care enough to seek advice on here, you’re on the right track. Enjoy your summer and come back in August with a positive outlook and be open to trying new things.

"Private School Rant I would like to share my feelings on private school vs public school. I feel free to join the discussion if you are so inclined. I am a bit heated right now, so apologies if I ramble on. 

I decided to post this because I keep seeing, across all forms of media, the implication that private school is “good” and public school is “bad”. This mindset has spread through movies, TV shows, and has ingrained itself into the mind of our culture. This makes me angry on so many levels! Public school is a fundamental part of what makes our country amazing. It allows access to education for everyone. Private schools have perverted that system and public schools now have a bad reputation. Here are some of my beliefs, in no particular order. 

1) Private schools often don’t require a credential for teachers to teach there. People seem to think that you get better teachers at private school, but often they are not trained in education and haven’t had experience working with kids prior. 

2) Private schools get to pick and choose which students they accept. Any student who doesn’t perform as well or who has even the slightest behavioral needs or learning accommodations can be kicked out. This is now private schools can boost their test scores and seem like they are so much better. They only take the kids who fit their mold. In a private-only model, so many students would be left in the dust and denied an education. 

3) Private schools are essentially a way to resegregate schools. Families of wealth, often white families with generational wealth, pay tens of thousands of dollars to not have to go to school with “those kids”. The private schools then use that money to buy state of the art equipment and technology for those already privileged students, causing the education gap to widen. If all of that money was diverted to making public education stronger, then EVERYONE would have access to these materials. 

4) This is more on the backend, but private schools aren’t unionized in most cases. Teachers have  no protections and often make less money. The schools can do whatever they want at any time. I love having the support of a union for collective bargaining and to protect teachers from unjust firings. 

Overall, I believe that private schools are a cancerous leech on our education system. I don’t remember where I heard this quote, but it was something along the lines of “if you force the rich kids to go to public school, the quality of the public schools will improve dramatically”. We as a nation need to start investing in our public schools and start cracking down on private school who are sucking up resources that could be used to benefit everyone. 

I have more, but I can’t think of them right now. I’m happy to respectfully debate with anyone who disagrees with me on this topic.",post,r/teachers,Education,38.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Teachers/comments/1kup100/private_school_rant/

In many other countries private schools barely exist and the rich kids go to public, schools are funded more equally (not through local property taxes) and so it’s absolutely possible to be poor in a poor neighborhood and get a similar quality of education to a wealthy kid.

Everything you said, though, confirms what I was trying to say in my post.

I don’t want to engage in personal attacks. 

To your point about higher expectations, I disagree. They kick people out who have learning differences, but people who like their pockets can get away with almost anything. My friend who teaches at a private catholic school had a group of boys who were athletes have a group chat where they were discussing which girls they wanted to r***. None of them got in any trouble whatsoever. I don’t call that high expectations. They also cover up issues to protect their image. 

If public schools had more resources, they could have more SROs to help with smoking, more counselors to support students, more equipment and personnel to support students with learning need, etc.

"Worst send off TLDR: My principal just gave me the worst send off ever. It really would have been better to get nothing said.

I have been at my middle school (4-6 grade here in LA) for 16 years. I’ve been the band director, general music teacher, and for the past 3 years the choir director. Not only that, I am also in charge of most after school events, all the things we need sound stuff for, webmaster, assisting TRT with chromebooks, and anything else. When they don’t have subs for the ancillary staff, I hound admin to make the schedule or just do it myself and tell others the plans. I am also the person that gets asked to cover any other class to teach it.

 I do too much and after 16 years am burnt. 
I have my administration certification and for the past 10 years, been interviewing but always told “not yet.”

I finally had it, and because I have a secondary mathematics certification and training in SWE, put in and received a job as a high school math teacher.

I was told not to tell students because the principal was going to at the different awards. At 4th grade, he announced a homeroom teacher retiring but “didn’t have time to announce about me.” 5th grade, the Guidance Counselor made him (caused all my band kids especially the boys to cry). 6th grade, he made a quick comment.

AND THEN TODAY, at the final faculty meeting, the principal got up, announced I was leaving, and showed a 10 second TikTok that made fun of beginning band. That was it. Moved on to the teacher retiring.

Never have I felt more insulted.

"I'm being asked to sign for observations that never happened. For context: I've taught for 10+ years. This is my first year in a new state and the school I'm working at is an absolute mess. 

On Friday afternoon, I received several emails for signatures for a first and second formal observation and a mid-year review. These meetings never happened. My principal has seen me teach twice, both times, conveniently when district staff was on campus. 

I don't want to sign. The culture at this school is SO shitty and I don't want to be complicit. I have never minded being observed and prior to this was at a school with an extremely involved admin observation process and a culture in which peers, instructional coaches, and district staff would routinely observe me. I like getting feedback and, frankly, it would suggest that the admin here have any interest in high quality instruction. 

I have already signed a contract for next year at another school in the district and I know of at least 2 other teachers on my grade level team who are transferring to other schools in the district as well. 

What should I do? Has anyone else found themselves in this situation.

Edit:

Some added context about where I'm coming from, since ""unanimous forgery"" was not the response I expected.


I've worked at 3 schools in another state for 11 years where this would be *unthinkable.* And I've had colleagues across districts with the same experience. So for context, for the past 11 years, I had 2 formal conferences, with a pre- and post meetings with the admin, as well as a beginning of year conference, mid-year reflection, and end-of-year reflection. 

And I always found observation to be a meaningful process. I got generally solid feedback and enjoyed a reflective conversation. It was a formative way that I grew as a teacher and there is research to support strong observation systems as relevant to student achievement. I also saw incompetent teachers evaluated out of schools. 

So please forgive me for not realizing that this is shockingly common. I guess I'll think about it. This year has been an absolute nightmare and this just feels like one last gut punch of utter incompetence. As referenced in one of my comments below, this is not an under-resourced school. I have no idea what the fuck admin is doing all day that keeps them from observing like, 15 teachers apiece, when admin had 30+ at my last school and managed to keep up with the aforementioned observation process.",post,r/teachers,Education,47.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Teachers/comments/1kulba4/im_being_asked_to_sign_for_observations_that/

"How common is this? My son graduated last night.  His class had only 88 students.  Best graduation I've ever attended, it ran so smoothly!

To my shock, the School Administrator approached my son with a stack of Envelopes.  Picked one out with my son's name hand written on it.  They chatted for a moment. Administrator asked appropriate questions that were personal to my son.  Hugged him.  My son opened the card this morning. The Administrator handwrote the card and there was cash in it!!  

Is this normal these days?  This Administrator knew every single student by name.  Chuckled about the senior prank in his very short speech!  When I graduated(same school different admin) the Administrator couldn't pick anyone out.

We had one field trip this year where parents were allowed to attend. It was to a state park. I have 27 in my class, and was SO thankful that I had 5 parents volunteer to come. Until I realized that they don’t do jack shit except sit there and talk to each other, and one of the parents backed out the night before. 

During the field trip, I turned around and saw that one of the parents wasn’t there. I asked someone where she went and they said “oh she went back to her car.” No heads up or anything, she just left the group without telling me. She eventually came back with a blanket in tow bc she was cold. 

At one point, I asked one parent to walk with me to take a group to the bathroom (it was a long walk), while the other 3 parents watched the kids that didn’t need to go to the bathroom. I started heading that way, and halfway there, I turned around and realized no parent came with me. They were all just chatting off to the side, not even watching the group of kids that I left with them.

"Since you asked for a hot take, I'll give you a hot take. Administration are class traitors. They gave up the opportunity to actually impact student learning and grabbed the bag of money and in exchange they became puppets of county bureaucracy. Bureaucracy is not inherent in education. We have invented the bureaucracy that underpins education in response to external pressure. Teachers do not need administrators, what we need is parental support. The ability to give a kid's attention on my own then what's the admin needed for? If I have the opportunity to give a kid ISS as a consequence again, what is the administration needed for? 

What we need are people who are good at logistics. We need people who can plan out routes and procedures that get goods and teachers to the right place to do our jobs. Past that not really seeing much need for them. All administration does is pass on directions from above like middle managers, they had no value to the process, they're just an intermediary between the powers that be and the lower classes, that being the general teacher. 

I can already hear some county office people and administration talking about how their jobs are so vitally important, but at the end of the day we've been educating human beings for a long, long time, and we've seen very little growth in in the fundamentals of that practice. Have parents backed us up and would just let us assign natural consequences, we wouldn't even really need ISS. Do stupid thing? Deal with the consequences of that stupid thing. Trash my room. Fix my room. Be a little shit who no one likes well then you have no friends. Get into a fight. Get your ass beat. Even bullies will eventually get their ass beat.

She then attempted to advocate for the entire student body and tell me a 40 minute movie over the class novel is unreasonable even though they work as a whole class and got 7 days of class time. Students knew 3 werks before the due date and where also given the option to make a documentary. Only 1 class (Fr) made one in 40 min.

On the last day of school she emailed me asking for my rubrics and how the scores were broken down. Staff were dismissed to leave after 12 if their checklist was complete; so I did. I just checked my email and saw she emailed me an hour after I left asking for her son's breakdown. School is out and grades have been finalized. do i bother emailing back?",post,r/teachers,Education,7.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Teachers/comments/1kuqfxy/email_at_end_of_year/

"What should I do in this situation? Send my admin a formal notice that I refuse to return to work until they give me their detailed response plan? I'm a woman who teaches middle school. 

- 3 of my former (male) students knocked on the door at lunch

- I opened it a sliver and said ""hey"", the two in the front literally pried it open. As in, pulled it from the outside and opened it and came in

- I told them to get out, go away

- They don't listen. 3 of them come in and sit down. They closed the door behind them.

- I'm like wtf I've never had students not listen like this and they were all borderline-trouble markers last year who are now fully trouble makers 

- I was trying to downplay the situation so I'm like ""okay I'll talk to them for a bit then they'll leave"" 

- two of them immediately go into stuff like ""yeah, so and so got in trouble for saying the n-word, this happened, that happened, etc.""

- one of them goes ""hey, remember when you wrote me a referral twice just for asking a question?"" **the question was him asking me if I've seen a celebrity sex tape**. This is now the THIRD time this little weirdo has brought this up to me. 

- the rest was a blur. one of them calls me ""chopped"" (ugly) and they all start drawing really offensive stuff on the board, like a pig and me with a triple chin. I'm embarrassed to say it made me cry after they left. 

- as they're doing this, i've told them to leave at least 4 times. 

- i get up and stand by the door and tell them to leave again

- still don't listen 

- finally the fourth kid who was with them (not my former student, he wasn't involved in any of the bad stuff at all) gets up and leaves because he's also like ""wtf"" as his friends behavior. THEN the other three leave because their friend left. 

This happened a few hours ago and I'm still speechless. I wrote referrals *and* emailed admin about the sexual comment that kid made but I am just SO UPSET at these boys forcing their way into my room and refusing to leave.

"Wife forced to resign... need advice So,  as the title says, my wife was nonrenewed.  Not because she's a bad teacher,  but because the super wanted to replace her unit with a STEAM class ( wife is art).  So,  some nepobaby friend of the super gets a job and my wife is ""offered the opportuniti to resign""   because her principal didn't want her to have to say she was fired ( he actually had to fight for this kindness).  He's written her a great rec letter as well.   She's got rec letters from every principal she's worked for.   She's really is a rockstar teacher and has only ever left two other schools ( one because it was elementary and she was teaching 1200 kids and her highly beloved principal was retiring, and one because she wanted to move from elementary to the High school level, her boss actually cried when she resigned that one)  so,  nepobaby gets the job at this high school.   She's applied for both elementary and high school and likes teaching both.  She knows both principals.  There's a chance both will offer her the job.   But if they do it may be at different times.   She needs to work because I'm in education too.  She doesn't want to take a job just because it's the first offered.   She wants to take the right job.   She's ok with teaching either.   So here's the question: without having one school system rescinding their offer because she appears to be waffling, how can she manage it to be able to truly weigh both options and choose the best fit for her to serve kids.   Both positions if offered are equally good for her,  but if she chooses one it permanantly closes the door on later applying to the other system",post,r/teachers,Education,34.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Teachers/comments/1kubl78/wife_forced_to_resign_need_advice/

"Apologies  Dear Teachers,


I was a troubled, disruptive but overall good kid. I had a horrible home life growing up which caused me to be quite a nuisance at school.  Most if not all the teachers gave up on me including the AVID ones. I never wanted to be in AVID. I was put there because they thought it would help me. I just became a disturbance that brought the whole program down. I kept slacking off and being such a nuisance until 10th grade I was dropped. It was not until I reached college did I change things around. Most of the home problems were gone and I met people who were willing to change me for the better. I have a gpa above a 3 but it's somehwat a struggle. I am managing to learn and improve my skills of learning and practice. 










  I was a bit angry for a while wondering why no one confronted me or tried to help me. It was only until I started looking into teaching and k-12 public education did things change. I started and still do feel a bit guilty about it. I started to understand why they may not have intervened. I would like to apologize to those. If I see them again and if they would want it. Otherwise it would just annoy them about something they have moved on already. Some of do change and regret heavily the actions we did as kids.

My home was mostly neglectful yet controlling. My family had others dump all their problems on my parents including my sister. She dumped all her problems and children on us so she could live her life and finish school. Home life made me numb because they expected me to do everything. They didn't really have enough time to raise me. I was stuck home all the time. It was also due to the the fear and trauma I experienced from an insanely abusive babysitter when I was in elementary school. My parents were also extremely busy to take care of me. Made me feel like no one genuinely cared unless I gave something of value.  I was a kid and yet they expected the world of me without putting too much effort. I wondered how I could help kids in my situation as an adult. It could be through creating legal partner programs for troubled youth using safe and legal means.

It's a substack, but the research behind it seems accurate. This is what you get from passing the buck on and on and on. Most ENGLISH MAJORS couldn't understand Dickens, or any other dense texts. 

Many of them were English education majors, meaning they'll be the ones working with us soon. 

De-professionalizing and removing barriers to certification (not financial ones--we need paid student teaching and free certification exams) will make it easier for these people to be teaching your kids. 

This is what the ""never fail anyone...they'll catch up later"" mentality did. People got gassed up into thinking they were good at ELA because they always made 100s on their essays because no one ever told them that they were given a 100 for completion and not because they actually understood anything.

"I'm not entirely sure if I want to get a teaching job I'm 25 and I graduated university last year with an education degree.

I had a difficult time finding a job over the summer because I couldn't pass all my (6) state tests in time to get certified. It was kind of a bummer.

However, over the summer I found a private disability service company to work for, and I took the job. I worked it through the school year, and it's been a great gig honestly. It won't be my forever place of work for a couple reasons, but it's been a great transition job.

This past winter, something sparked my interest in banking. I've become a lot more invested in finances, and I'm used to customer service-type jobs. I've also heard some pretty decent things about it from trusted individuals. So it's just sparked my interest as something I could potentially try.

But in looking for banks, I've realized, that I'm sort of mentally moving beyond the desire to get a teaching job. I'm not sure how to feel about it. On one hand, I feel like I'd be moving away from a lot of politics and school bullshit that comes with the job (yes, I know that banks go through bullshit too). But on another hand, I feel like I got this degree. Worked towards it for 5 years. And I may never pursue the job title that it qualifies me for.

"Yes!!! So when I was in 11th grade history, I was a straight A student , always finished my classwork within 10 to 15 minutes with plenty of time to spare. During that time to spare, id always work on homework for other classes. I was very quiet and very productive or at least thats what I thought when I was a teen. My history teacher would slam her books down on top of my desk and get angry. How could you work on homework from other classes?!!! I was shocked she was getting angry at me and so was the whole class. I was typically your teachers pet, not on the receiving end of a teachers wrath. She continues on and says you should have been in honors classes if all my work is too easy for you! You should come to me for more work instead of doing what you did.

I went to my parents and they supported me saying I did nothing wrong. She was the only teacher I hated. I did not let her actions bother me and continued to carry that time efficiency mindset well into my career. 

Now after having taught for two years as a probationary teacher, I see why she reacted the way she did. She was a first year teacher and she was living in fear of being evaluated by the principal and would have been docked for ""not teaching bell to bell"" and they would have pinned my behavior onto her not being a good teacher. She was worried the principal would walk in and see me do that. I didnt know her side of the story as a teen and she didnt know my story either (I refused honors because I was already taking a lot of community college classes for credit, honors/AP was a waste of time for me). Sometimes I wish I can go back and say now I understand.

Looking for advice and tips My 5 year old has literally started crying/moaning about absolutely everything getting her hair done, getting ready, doing the bedtime routine we have always done and at time she becomes very frustrated with doing just the simple day to day tasks. I will add this has been a massive change since she started school 🤔.
Things like a day out we find she crys a lot for example we went to the cinema tonight and got popcorn and drink we all had an amazing time and loved the film. When we came out other kids where going into a later showing and they had the characters covers, teddies and bottles and that was her whating me to take her to the shop and buy her the teddies as soon as I explained we were going to the shop today and she would maybe get them another day she cried the whole way home, then once I explained again it was a sore eye, she didn't feel well it's just never ending and mainly starts but she isn't getting what she wants.
Another thing is not listening I tell her not to do something and she just continues to do it anyway even though I have said no more than once.
Also when she asks me something and I say yes or no or give me a wee minute or even give her the answer she continues to ask and ask and ask.
Is this behaviour normal for her age?am starting to really get frustrated with it as it feels like a constant battle all day everyday from the first minute I ask her to do something eg choose breakfast, get ready to the last thing come get your teeth done, go to the toilets

"How common is dyscalculia? How are students usually affected by this? I have been teaching mathematics on a higher ed level for about 5 years now. And I've been wondering -- how common is dyscalculia? I have many students who have stated to me, in the past, that they struggle with this. Usually I am seeing that the problem mainly manifests by not understanding the foundation of mathematics, and struggling with understanding things like why –7 is less than –2.

That said, I am seeing that many people claim to have dyscalculia as adults. Many to the point where the term ""dyscalculia"" seems to just lose all of its meaning. The math ed system is flawed in many ways, and emphasizes test-taking abilities over understanding. And naturally, many people really dislike math. However, I have a very tough time believing that every other person who I come across who doesn't like math automatically has dyscalculia.

"You know I really wonder about this. If I still had to do math I'd consider testing for it. Can't keep track of large numbers. Adding 2 digit numbers in my head fails about half the time, and im always counting on my fingers. 7+5 thats finger counting time if I want to be sure. I understand, conceptually, complex math problems but reliably get the answer wrong because????!?! 

Stats was easier for me because it was mostly interpreting numbers, Algebra makes me want to tear my hair out. I've memorized dozens of poems and monolouges but still mix up my times tables. I can't do the math subtracting 2 dates from each other without writing it down and doing all the carrying. (Unless I want to be wrong, of course. I do it in my head and do it wrong constantly. Just the other day I confidently said 1994 was ""about 40 years ago"".)

I remember very distinctly a math teacher (7th grade, so it ""should be easy for us"") giving us one of those times table quizzes you have to do really fast and purposefully picking me to read the numbers for the last row (which I had not completed in time, despite trying). I cried. Don't do that. 

I dont teach math (for... obvious reasons) or science so it doesn't come up with students much but I wonder. Math becomes a lot easier for me if im allowed to use a calculator for simple addition/subtraction/multiplication. For me I understood math only when it was explained in full. Completing the square was agony until my teacher worked out for me *why* it works like it does. Then it was still agony but slightly lesser. If you're trying to teach someone like me, focus on concepts, point out non judgementally little number errors so they can be fixed early, and focus on how the math works not just ""here's a number formula that apparently works that you can never remember.""

"Sorry. Here is some further clarification:

I have been teaching for over 30 years. I teach at an all-boys Catholic high school on the south side of Chicago. We have a phone policy, and when teachers enforce it (I do) it works.

I am talking about on their school-issued ChromeBooks. I will be lecturing, or reading aloud, or having a discussion with another student, or another student could even be giving a presentation… and right in the middle, at full volume, some knucklehead starts watching game footage on full volume. My high one day was sending 7 students out for it. And, then there are the days when the student insists that it is the student next to them, but I can’t prove it, so I spend. 10 minutes arguing, and then I just end up sending both students out because they both end up being disrespectful to me.

When asked about it, they just say l, “You won’t let me wear headphones.” The students maintain that if I am having them use a device for an assignment, I shouldn’t dictate which other tabs they have open if they are doing my work.

It’s dumb. And, the parents are just like, “well, let him wear headphones, then.”

"Are we losing the ability to listen to each other? I'm curious if anyone has experienced that students have been less and less able to listen to each other. I teach literature and languages in secondary school and I love discussions with students! However, I have noticed that an increasing number of students is not able to listen to each other - they simply don't care. They don't even care that they are hurting the students as they speak loudly with their neighbour or they simply play a game on their phone without caring to listen to others. Or when I ask a question, a number of students starts talking one over another without any patience to wait for their time to speak. So the class changes into a loop of constant reminders that when one speaks, the rest remains silent, but I must say it is exhausting and I also find it terrifying that we are all inside our bubbles which protect us from thinking through and possibly confronting others' opinions.",post,r/teachers,Education,9.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Teachers/comments/1kubsgo/are_we_losing_the_ability_to_listen_to_each_other/

"How did you prepare for essay writing in the SBI PO? Preparing for essay writing in SBI PO felt overwhelming at first but once you understand the format and expectations it becomes manageable. The key is consistent reading editorials opinion columns, and government reports helped build my vocabulary and awareness of current issues. Practice was non-negotiable. I wrote 2–3 essays a week, timed and reviewed them critically.

I also studied past topics like digital economy, financial inclusion, and social reforms. Structuring the essay with a strong intro, balanced body and thoughtful conclusion made a huge difference. Tools like mock platforms and online peer feedback helped too.

"Creative Educators & Artists: Looking for wild, fun & radical Mixed Media Assignments or Projects. Hey everyone! I’m a film & TV professional with a background in contemporary media art and education. I’m currently building a collection of creative mixed-media project ideas for workshops, schools, and fellow educators.

I recently discovered the book *Wicked Arts Assignments*, and it lit a fire under me. It’s a compilation of art assignments from creatives and educators around the world, and I want to create something similar for projects involving video, photography, sound, performance, and digital storytelling. I’m not looking to steal or repackage work. The goal is to make a resource that helps artists, educators, and students spark new kinds of creativity, especially in places where inspiration is hard to find.

I’ve been collecting ideas over time (on Instagram, notes, from my teaching, etc.), and I’m now hoping to gather more diverse, unusual, or fun assignments from the creative community.

I’m looking for:

* Unusual, playful or radical mixed media prompts
* Projects that combine different art forms
* Assignments that spark personal reflection or social commentary
* Low-budget but high-creativity ideas

Here are some ideas from the [Wicked Arts Assignment Book](https://www.wickedartsassignments.com/) that I liked the most. 

*  Fake Your Social Media - Fake everything on your social media account for a week. A project to create awareness about the reality on social media. 
* Create a conspiracy theory about your school and make a vlog about it. Be elaborate and convincing. Anything is possible.
* Write a dialogue between two characters relying on found material on the internet only.
* Make the artwork that is described by a museum text.
* Anti-Self-Portrait Photograph your opposite.



 Here are some of my own ideas that I am working on, but have not tried yet

* Tell the story of a stranger based only on found digital traces.
* Shoot a one-minute video where the camera never moves, but everything else changes.
* Document your day using reflections only (mirrors, windows, puddles, screens).
* Record a phone call (scripted or improvised) and build a visual piece around it.
* Film a conversation without showing any people. Show only objects, spaces, or shadows reacting.
* Take a photo every time you blink for one hour. Turn the series into a flickering video journal.
* Send a message to a stranger without words. Use images, movement, or sound to try and be understood. This could be public or interactive (QR codes, urban interventions, email drops).
* Make a short film where every shot is a mistake. (no focus, bad lighting, camera falls over) Use editing to make it intentional.
* Shoot a film where you're both director and subject, but pretend you're two different people.
* Stage a crime scene using only natural light and one room. No humans, just aftermath.
* Photograph your neighbourhood as if it were a sci-fi world. No effects, just framing, light, and imagination.

  
If you have any creative or educational prompts that involve video, photography, or cross-media work, I’d love to hear them!

"Have you considered turning your teaching recordings into polished educational videos? Hi educator community!

I'm currently exploring how AI can help educators transform their recorded lessons or lectures into **engaging educational videos**—complete with visuals, supplemental info, and better structure for student consumption.

Many of you already put tremendous effort into crafting quality content, and I believe tech could help take that to the next level. But I also know that workflows, preferences, and needs vary a lot—and that's why I’m reaching out.

I'd love your input on a few things:

* Have you ever tried (or considered) turning your teaching recordings into educational videos?
* If yes, what tools or methods did you use—and what worked or didn’t?
* If not, what's holding you back? Time, tools, technical concerns, value-add?
* Any specific frustrations or ideas you'd want a tool like this to solve?

I’d truly appreciate your insights—whether you're new to this or have been experimenting with video-based teaching for a while. Your feedback will directly shape how I build this tool to better support real educator needs.

"Warning: Petro-Pedagogy is NOT a valid teaching resource Climate denial in the classroom includes petro-pedagogy. The term has been used to describe the energy-industrial complex funding energy and climate education programmes 60 for K-12 education, especially in STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) education (Eaton and Day, 2019, p. 462). A general relationship has unfolded: 

  **non-profit education programmes + energy-industrial complex sponsorship = petro-pedagogy**. 

Beware of the energy-industrial complex bearing gifts. Petro-pedagogy is a Trojan Horse with climate denial stealthily hidden within and brought into the classroom, attempting to convert children and teachers into fossil fuel enthusiasts. Petropedagogy teaches that oil is a benefactor to humanity and that modern civilization cannot exist without fossil fuels, but says little, if anything at all, about the connection of fossil fuels to the climate crisis (Eaton and Day, 2019; Tannock, 2020). This newer expression of climate denial is one also used by “oil apologists” who laud fossil fuels by exaggerating how indispensable their contribution is to society yet are silent on their negative impact on the climate; this is climate denial by omission (Kutney, 2022).",post,r/TeachingResources,Education,1.0,https://gc.copernicus.org/articles/8/81/2025/gc-8-81-2025.html

"Tutoring bottom-set maths students has shocked me — has it become normal to not know the basics? TL;DR:

I’m a maths tutor working mainly with bottom-set students. Many GCSE and KS2 students I teach don’t know basics like column multiplication or simple division.

I’d love to hear from teachers:

* Is this something you’ve noticed too?
* Has it always been this way, or is it getting worse?
* What are the real causes — system, school policy, teaching limitations, home support, or something else?
* What resources or strategies work best for rebuilding the basics in students this far behind?



POST:

Hi everyone.

I’m a part-time maths tutor, mostly working with bottom-set students — and I’ve been genuinely shocked by how many of them lack basic maths skills. I’m trying to understand why this is happening, and I’d love to hear your thoughts.

For example, I recently prepared a Year 6 student for their SATs. When asked what 1000 divided by 2 was, they didn’t know — and weren’t joking. We had to practise 50 ÷ 2, 100 ÷ 2, and 1000 ÷ 2 as actual content. Over 3 months, with 4 two-hour lessons a week, they got to averaging 70% on mock arithmetic papers and we managed to cover some reasoning too.

But I don’t understand how a child can reach Year 6 with such gaps, and for no one at school to have noticed or addressed it.

This isn’t an isolated case. I’ve tutored GCSE students who couldn’t do column multiplication (e.g., 54 × 7). In many cases, I’ve had to go back to teaching primary-level maths, essentially speed-running their entire education in the final months before exams. Despite this, every one of them has achieved at least a grade 5 — which tells me the issue isn’t intelligence. Something else is going wrong.

Often, it seems like teachers are assigning work at the level they expect the student to be at for their age, even though the student clearly doesn’t have the foundations to understand it — makes them inevitably unable to do and follow the work in class.

Is it that:

* Students require one to one attention which teachers don’t have the resources to give, and if they don’t get it at home in early years there is nothing that can be done?
* Underperforming kids get lumped in ‘bottom sets’ where teachers assume they will never understand and just give up on them?
* The government has made tests harder without providing the necessary support for teachers?
* Teachers have to follow a lesson plan set by the school which doesn't allow time to go back and fix problems that should have been dealt with ages ago?
* Teachers are unaware of how far behind some kids are — maybe because students are hiding it, or cheating on homework and internal tests?
* There's no point teaching maths to kids that are not inclined to eventually go into more academic careers?
* I’m just seeing the worst end of things because of the students I’m hired to help, and it's not actually that bad?

My family (who are not from the UK) have blamed it on the fact that in other countries students will not pass onto the next year unless they have met the standard, whereas in the UK students can theoretically get to the final year of their school career without ever having learnt anything.

I also spoke with an ex-primary teacher who said the government has made tests harder (especially reasoning), but schools haven’t been given the support to prepare all students — so the top kids get the focus, and the rest fall further behind.

Is this something you guys are seeing too? Do you know why this is happening?

Would be interesting to know since I can only see from outside as a private maths tutor.

I also don't know myself because I've been through the whole UK school system as a kid (I'm in my mid 20's now), but I've always been in top sets, so I don't know if this is just always how its been or if things are getting worse.

I’m confident in my ability to support these students one-to-one and rebuild their confidence. But it takes intense work — 3 months of 4 sessions a week, 2 hours at a time — which is only feasible for one student at a time. I’d love to find ways to help more students at scale, but I’m not sure how.

Also, many of the parents of these kids (though not all) either don’t have the maths skills themselves, don’t have the time or patience, or simply can’t afford private tuition.

I know this is a big and complex issue — or maybe I’m just seeing the worst cases due to the nature of my clients. Either way, I’d really appreciate your insights.

Have you had the student tested for dyslexia? My son could read and was a good student but around third grade he started having major meltdowns when I came to spelling tests and I was also getting calls about his lack of effort in writing. Turned out that  he has Dysgraphia which is the written type of dyslexia. He has no phonetics at all and people with dysgraphia find it painful to translate their thoughts into written words whether it is word processing or writing by hand. It is a processing disorder and dyslexics need a special type of learning that only licensed dyslexia tutors or specialists hold. There are only two ways to get the diagnosis one is from a neuropsychologist and the other is from a dyslexic specialist.,comment_3,r/TeachingResources,Education,,https://www.reddit.com/r/teachingresources/comments/1knf9mr/4th5th_grader_struggling_with_phonetic_spelling/
My son was unusual and that he was able to read but he could not spell at all and he literally would have a meltdown if he had to write. He was also very self-conscious and was afraid to misspell in fear of being made fun of so he had a very limited bank of words. As he gets older it becomes more difficult as the need to express yourself in the written form spreads across all of the subject areas. At this point he is finishing up his junior year in high school and college is not very plausible. Luckily he has always been interested in the trades or the military but in the amount of time wasted and the attitude and lack of support from the schools was heartbreaking.,comment_4,r/TeachingResources,Education,,https://www.reddit.com/r/teachingresources/comments/1knf9mr/4th5th_grader_struggling_with_phonetic_spelling/

"AI Debate Lesson: Understanding the Limits of Artificial Intelligence I've recently created a lesson plan which has all the necessary content (lesson plan, exit quiz questions for Vevox/Kahoot!, answer key, information pack, and something a bit different!)

"New to programming?  Don't fall for the myth of the genius programmer. This was a video from Google I/O way back in 2009 that I still think about it to this day.  It discusses the way we hide our work,  our questions, and our projects until one day we just showcase something amazing that built, first try, no errors,  ya know because we're geniuses.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SARbwvhupQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SARbwvhupQ)  
  
 The talk was hosted by Brian Fitzpatrick and Ben Collins-Sussman, in which they give this introductory description of the talk:

""A pervasive elitism hovers in the background of collaborative software development:  everyone secretly wants to be seen as a genius.  In this talk, we discuss how to avoid this trap and gracefully exchange personal ego for personal growth and super-charged collaboration.  We'll also examine how software tools affect social behaviors, and how to successfully manage the growth of new ideas.""

One part that resonated with me greatly was regarding the human developer.  ""I will toil in this cave and no one will know this code exists until it is perfect,  at which point I will emerge and be recognized for the genius I am.""   On reddit,  have you ever done some quick research before clicking that ""post"" button,  out of concern you may be wrong or fearful of backlash?  Same concept.

The consequence of this (among others) is that neither your team nor the newer generation of programmers will get to see all of the failure you had to endure, to achieve that one cool thing,  because of the way we want to be viewed.  Enduring those failures and overcoming them,  I believe,  is more important then, and required by, any programming language, framework, tool, etc.

Newcomers have all the resources, AI, and work previous generations have accomplished to look up to but we are doing those people a disservice by hiding our failures due to human emotion wether thats how we want to be viewed or general fear of negative feedback from our work.

Hopefully this doesn't offend anyone or become divisive,  it's just some unspoken honesty that I have appreciation for and it stuck with me because honestly... it hit close to home when I saw it back then.",post,r/learnprogramming,Education,235.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1kujmka/new_to_programming_dont_fall_for_the_myth_of_the/

"Why it sucks to practice code as a beginner Hey everyone,  
I'm currently learning full-stack web development and have completed HTML and CSS. I understand intermediate-level CSS concepts like Flexbox, positioning, colors, typography, and more.

But here's the problem:  
Even though I *know* these things, when I sit down to make a project or design something on my own, my brain freezes. I can’t figure out what to make, how to style it well, or how to even get started. I always end up giving up.

I tried sites like [cssbattle.dev](https://cssbattle.dev), but they feel way too complex and exhausting for me at this level.

Now I’ve started learning JavaScript. I understand the basics like variables, functions, loops, objects, and so on. But again — when it comes to *practicing* it, I don’t know what to do or where to start. I’m stuck in what people call **“tutorial hell.”** I watch tutorials and feel like I get it… but I can’t build anything on my own.

"There are some books i can recommend which are good indeed, and absolutely worth having and reading.  
Reading a book about programming/game development/tech always gives me and my employees a certain peace of mind in these ""fast paced"" days we are living in nowadays.

Some recommendations:  
\- The pragmatic programmer as stated by the OP.  
\- Game design patterns by Robert Nystrom.  
\- C# player guide (for entry level c# in a playful way, i love that book even in my age haha), by RB Withaker  
\+ extra's ...  
\- Countless books on Maya (3D software) for modeling, rigging, animating and Substance painter of adobe  
\- Unity mobile development (we do not do mobile dev. but it is interesting)  
\- books on indie company creation/founding - leading - tax - law - vision, ...  
\- More game design and pattern books of various authors and topics  
\- How to build a game engine ...

i did not write out all the full names with authors after the third mention, because we have a entire little library here. In my company (small indie game development company), we have that thing going, where everyone is supposed to read 1 book about game development or any topic related to it in any way, and then present the book in a short conversation within the team, so that everyone learns the most notable pointers from it.

\-> benefits of doing this: team building, information sharing, learning to be charismatic, learning to analyse, learning to make clean summaries, and obviously everyone learns the good parts without ""wasting"" extra time (""good"" may be subjective - which again supports the thought of having the books, so everyone that is interested in certain topics can read the related book at any given time without depending on the internet and without requiring to have electronics with + reading on paper can be mind soothing, nicely outside in the garden or nature or a quiet room or such)

Even if some books offer not much knowledge for us anymore, it is important to see other peoples view on the topics to not get stuck in a tunnel vision of knowledge. Every book that offers at least one advice or reminds you of something (may it be simple and obvious) that you just lost track of, is a good book :D

  
\-> Certain courses and other material is important too, since nowadays there are other ways to learn also, for example via. AI / Audio books / podcasts / streams / videos / meet-up's / lectures.....

\-> Books are not and will never be fully replaced, due to their availability and independency



If anyone is interested in specific books that have to do with game development, contact me in a DM or on this post, then i may give some recommendations and some ""not worth it"" mentions hehe.

"Is my university unreasonable for asking us to do this project? So basically, I'm studying first year of CS, we're at the end of the year and we learnt about the basics of c++, using simple data structures like maps, or binary trees, or lists, pointers , and classes.

  
As a part of a final project we have been tasked to create a Finder class that accepts pointers to any type of object. It assumes the object has a get rectangle function that gives it's left, right, top and bottom coordinates. It must be able to add, erase, and update the positions.

The last function  must return a set that contains the pointers to the objects that are inside or intersect with a given rectangle. and the problem is we have to do it in O(log n) with n being the number of rectangles on the container.

In my research I've found that to accomplish  this I've gotta use complex (at least for me) data structures like rtrees or quadtrees, which doesn't seem very reasonable to me.

"When You're Great at Programming, But You Suck at Programming In my 10 years so far with tech, I have had the absolute pleasure to work alongside some brilliantly talented and well educated programmers. However, I have seen those same developers have their arguments and perspectives fall flat, despite their technical prowess, while less technically gifted minds withhold tremendously valuable ideas for fear of being caught on a technicality or unknown detail.

TL;DR - We are taught that cleanliness and efficiency of code is the earmark of a quality solution. While important, we fail to educate programmers on the importance of factors beyond the code and how to navigate the complexity and priorities of a real application. This post is for anyone who is truly curious about what ""good code"" really means, and for those who suspect the answer has more to do with the problems you solve than the language you use to do it.

**Introduction**

Goodhart's Law - ""When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure.""

I think most of us have experienced those often frustrating debates between programmers where one is claiming the other has an inferior approach because ""I could write it faster by doing x."" or ""I could write it with less complexity by doing y.""

My goal with this post is to primarily open up discussion around this topic and hopefully provide something valuable from my 10 years of doing software development.

Before I dig in, I think it's only fair to say where I come from. I have worked the last 10 years in cloud development, working with a lot of different SaaS, PaaS, and IaaS technologies. I have dabbled a LITTLE in hardware and lower level languages - but never really had to do much in terms of deploying code for a new piece of hardware and have, admittedly, been a bit spoiled on not having to deal with things like managing pointers or resolving memory errors at a lower level. However, what I want to talk about should be a fair bit removed from that level of granularity and speaks more to how we as programmers approach a problem. That being said, I have worked as an admin using declarative tools, managed code bases of several million lines, and successfully implemented several medium and large scale system architectures in my time. That is to say, I've seen a lot of shit in the last decade.

**Conflating personal skills with solution quality**

With the preface out of the way, let me put my assertion straight. I see a lot of programmers conflating their proficiency with coding (speed to write code, initial resilience of code, complexity mitigation, readability, testability, etc.) as a reflection of solution quality. It is a frequent and concerning problem that many programmers are taught or conclude that the quality of how the code is written is above the functionality of the existing application.

For clarity, I am not saying that things like readability are irrelevant to the measurement of a solution's quality. Of course, all other things equal, a solution with more readable code is a better solution than the same with less readable code. What I am saying is that the actual influence of these metrics varies depending on the environment and context of the implemented solution.

For example, a small scale and local utility (such as a simple script for managing files in a folder) does not gain nearly as much proportional benefit from more readable code as a large scale ETL job managed by multiple people from multiple teams working in multiple frameworks. We could deliberate endlessly on what the ""correct"" weighting of these metrics are for any given project, but the real issue is when these metrics become surrogates for the strategic goal of the application.

The reality is that, when it comes down to the application running and doing its job, the only thing that matters is how well it does its job: How efficiently does it succeed when it is provided valid inputs, how effectively does it recover from unexpected inputs/results, and how safely does it fail in the event of an unrecoverable error?

Nobody cares that you made it super readable if it doesn't work. Nobody cares that you wrote it faster if it's laden with bugs. No one is happy that you reduced 30 lines to 2 lines if it makes the application a total resource hog. Similarly, nobody cares if it runs 500ms faster UNLESS that 500ms makes a difference in the grand scheme of the tech.

Simply put, there is an important and clear distinction between your skills as a programmer, and the quality of the solution you produce. While your technical skills as a programmer are EXTREMELY important, they do not necessarily ensure that the solutions you produce are quality solutions. It's a mistake I have seen a lot of developers make, and it leaves them bewildered because they felt they did everything right. It reminds me of the classic Indiana Jones scene when Jones simply shoots the guy showing off all his fancy moves. It looks cool, super impressive, but totally useless in the wrong context.

**Programming and solution quality is impacted by the real world and supporting relationships.**

""I would've never written it this way. They could've easily done x to make this better.""

We've all felt that way at least once. You are SO blessed to finally work on that bit of code that hasn't been touched in 25 years just to find it is such a convoluted mess of outdated checks, redundant assignments, tightly coupled classes, et al. The feat of the developers goes from ""This is really nice and sensible code that I can work with."" to ""How the hell did the last guy keep this thing running at all?""

This sentiment that you would've done it better by doing it your way is almost always a lie you're telling yourself. Here's why:

Programming, as we all hopefully understand by now, is an iterative process. That means to reach your ideal state, you necessarily cannot jump from step 0 to the final step. There are checkpoints you must cross in order to get there. However, these checkpoints are marked by the application's functionality, and the structure/ease of the code is loosely implied by the business/client at best.

In other words, the developer will always be pressured to produce functional code over ""clean"" code. I am not referring to the actual principles of Clean Code necessarily, just whatever your idea of the ""right way to write the code"" is.

This means that leading into these checkpoints, there are always unanswered questions and missing pieces of context that we wish we would have had in the beginning. I just recently was working on a report generation tool for a friend when, just a week before we needed it to be done, they decided to clarify that certain parts of the report needed to have dynamic labeling and columns when we had already understood them as static elements. As you can imagine, that's a totally different approach than I had originally planned for. With not enough time to totally rewrite the program, I had a choice:

1. Quickly refactor the code, accept that it'll be a bit messy, defer proper restructuring, happy client because it works.
2. Ask for an extension to the deadline, customer misses their reporting window, blame them for not being clear and not knowing that information at the beginning?

I, of course, asked for the extension. They, of course, denied the request. So, I went with option 1. Why? Because the relationship was more valuable to me than the structure of my code. I will absolutely take on a bit of a messier solution on the backend to secure another future project and ensure the client is happy **in this scenario**.

That's not to say it's always the right answer. I have refused to deploy changes that were of security or regulatory concern because not going to jail was more important than winning another project. I'm not even saying I am always right in which options I take for these situations. My point, as highlighted by the title of this section, is that the world around the application matters a LOT. Assuming you would have done it better without knowing all of the context for why those decisions were made is not only unfair to the previous developers, but is simply a conclusion driven by ego.

Tying this back to our main theme, you are measuring the quality of the solution based on metrics which are not the goal. The goal was a functional app that satisfied the defined requirements within the allotted timeline. That's it.

**Programmers have limitations. It's okay to not be a superhuman.**

I'm going to pivot the focus a bit and talk more about you - the programmer. I'm not going to say that every programmer is an antisocial basement dweller who would never suffer the presence of another human being or (God-forbid) a team building exercise. We know that already (jk).

Seriously, though, there are some INCREDIBLE programmers out there. I've seen people who have mastered a multitude of frameworks, seem to 100x processing times every time they touch something, and can build a decent MVP, if given all the info up front, at a break-neck pace.

But, I have also seen programmers who are incredible in a different way. They may be slower on the keyboard, but they do a much better job at diagnosing issues and getting to the root cause of a problem. Some of them are incredible at interpersonal relationship building (very valuable in tech as a programmer, just saying). Some can understand a seemingly limitless amount of complexity and boil things down to a simple direction that everyone understands. I've met and managed a few that seemed to be able to do all of it and more entirely on their own (usually 25+ YoE on those guys/gals).

We say this all the time, but I think we forget to take our own advice: Programming is so much more than the code. For every rockstar programmer I have had the pleasure of working with, I could identify several issues working with them. Even the guy who does it all tends to be a victim of their own success and struggles to not dominate the room when collaboration is a must. Everyone has their gaps in knowledge and that's okay. Programming is an absurdly broad, dense, and deep discipline.

I say this, because I still see it as a big issue in tech today. I think AI has really inflamed the issue too (I won't be getting into that) because of how many different ways there are to use this, frankly, very powerful tool. Please, for the sake of your sanity and enjoyment of programming, do not measure yourself OR OTHERS on a single dimension. It is my belief that a pillar of a good programmer is the ability to appreciate solutions and strengths which they do not possess nor understand, and the ability to keep the big picture in mind when addressing a potential weakness in themselves, the solution, or another programmer. Remember, comparison is the thief of joy.

**What leads to the surrogation of goals in software?**

I think it takes a lot of tolerance for uncertainty to work in tech. After all, your job is to essentially invent things that don't exist yet. Sure, there's a million pdf parsers out there, but there isn't one that does EXACTLY what you need the EXACT way you need it. There are 1000s of security camera models out there, but your new camera design (hopefully) taps into something the market is being starved of.

But, what the hell do you do when something like blockchain hits it big? What if you're required to use a library you've never even heard of? What if Maggie in accounting can't so much as find the damn Windows start button, yet she's the VP of your project and wants to know every little technical detail just to ridicule things she doesn't understand? Dammit Maggie, it's a REST call! IT'S JUST A....

On top of that, we hardly have much consensus on what ""good code"" even is - or the ""right"" way to do it. We had waterfall for some 30 years, then Agile happened, but we still have waterfall and now we have hybrid Waterfall/Agile teams with varying adherence to either paradigm. Sometimes they just make up their own rules and call it Agile because they do stuff on a bi-weekly cadence.

Plus, you have Scrum and Kanban muddying the waters. But, you also have standards like TOGAF and ITIL. Let's also not forget how SaaS providers like Jira have their own rules to abide by. Honorable mention to the books and onslaught of professionals saying ""I have figured it out! Buy my shit."" That's all before you even get to the framework you're going to be working in. It's a freaking mess!

The reality is, we just don't know what perfect code is. We can generally approximate when code is written poorly or well, and we can loosely articulate the reasons and speculations around that approximation, but we don't \*know\* if it's right except for very specific cases (of which there are still many examples). Nearly everything is up to debate, and it can be really hard to be certain that the code we write is good. Except, it doesn't need to be.

**Preventing surrogation of goals.**

Ironically, one of the most important lessons I have learned in tech has been from the least technical users I have encountered. I learned that there are two questions that should always be guiding a solution.

1. Why does this work?
2. Why doesn't this work?

If you're underwhelmed, you probably should be. If you're enraged because of questions like -

1. What about the code structure and efficiency?
2. What about security?
3. How does this help me implement design patterns into my work?

\- bear with me.

As I mentioned in the beginning of this post, I have seen many programmers prioritize the quality of the code over the functionality of the app. I've seen it in practice as well as in conversations/debates amongst programmers. These questions still matter, but their relevance is predicated on how it answers the question of ""Why does this work,"" and/or ""Why doesn't this work?""

What about structure and efficiency? Is that why it does/doesn't work? If the current code structure does not significantly impact the solutions ability to work or not work, then it's a moot question. It's moot, because it has no meaningful bearings on how well the app does its job (or fails to do its job).

For a personal utility script where the focus is on development efficiency and functionality, not raw execution speed, a few seconds' difference in runtime is inconsequential. So the practical value of a faster script is diminished if it sacrifices development efficiency. Ultimately, **the script's success is defined by whether or not it works as intended.** In that regard, a 'slower' script developed in one hour can be a more pragmatic solution than a 'faster' one that took three hours to build.

Now, I said a lot about strengths and weaknesses of a programmer. So let's take it a step further and address the speed at which coding is done. I, frankly, am not a super fast coder. I'm not the slowest in the room, but I was never the guy who could just churn code like a factory (pattern).

I know, way to show my ass to the crowd. The thing is, I am simply stronger in analysis and communication than I am in writing code. I'm cool with being that guy. I love working with developers who are code factories and don't want to deal with people as much, because that's a complementary counterpart to what I bring to the table. So, while I focus on drafting demos and POCs and diagrams and all of these things about the application, they can focus on the real meat of the application, preventing backdoors, scaling efficiency, obscure mathematical theorems, etc.

However, since we are talking about a collaborative environment, it is important to note that this is not a siloed effort. I NEED to write production code because I NEED to understand what goes into it, pitfalls, and tricks. I may be subordinate to the code master next to me, but I cannot circumvent the necessity of actually doing the work. The same goes for the code master. They NEED to create diagrams and explain concepts because they NEED to understand how the customer feels, whether or not their idea can conceptually make sense to another person, and so on. Just like they bail me out if I back myself into a corner, I bail them out if they start fumbling the presentation. It goes both ways, and we both become exceptional for it.

**The True Programmer, and respecting your colleagues**

I know advocating for respect on an internet forum is a quintessential example of ""screaming into the void,"" but I'd be remiss if I didn't mention it.

Just like how I said we don't know a lot of things, we (as a society) don't know what a true programmer is. Something to do with writing code, something to do with building applications. I'm not here to claim that I have the be-all-end-all answer to what a true programmer is. Quite the opposite.

The literal definition of a programmer is pretty vague when you look at it from a technical perspective. There's a lot of nuance and layers to writing a computer program that we could spend a long time deliberating over. That is precisely why we must be very careful, or downright avoid, the argument that ""someone who does x"" or ""someone who doesn't know y"" is or is not a ""true programmer."" Fans of the True-Scotsman fallacy will know exactly what I mean here. It's an argument that leads to nowhere.

The reality is technology is a part of everyone's life, and everyone's perspective on it matters. We need non-technical users to break our apps and force us to come up with more resilient and intuitive designs. We need semi-technical users to help translate the real world to technical ideas with new and creative inspirations outside of the conventional walls. We need deeply technical users to navigate the gritty details of building the applications when they're 9 layers removed from the original problem. Most importantly, we need all of them to work together to build anything meaningful.

Everyone gets into tech with their own perspective for their own reasons. But what technology is, fundamentally, doesn't change. Whether it's writing a new business integration or starting a SaaS company or building robots or even developing new devices that don't require a plug - the whole idea of technology is rooted in discovery. We take the chaos the world presents us, and learn how to contain it and use it to achieve our goals. Fire became torches, circuits became software, and Maggie became a great lesson for me in what really matters in software.

I hope this post serves as a valuable reminder of all the things we still don't know in software and technology as a whole. I hope it reassures newcomers that it's okay to feel like everything is a hot mess - because it is. I also hope it helps to soothe some of the hardened veterans who know things and learned lessons that the vast majority of society could hardly understand, let alone be expected to know. Finally, I hope it helps everyone make better applications by focusing on what really matters. Whether it's an actual project, or just discussing ideas with a stranger, we should always focus on why it does or doesn't work first, and remember that what is most valuable to us as programmers is not always what's most valuable to the applications themselves.

**P.S. Counter arguments and the importance of taking different approaches**

I am acutely aware that there are many software that are vastly different than the cushy business applications I have come to know. Even banks have a higher tolerance of failure than, say, the technology responsible for safely landing your aircraft. Furthermore, there is a very real snowball effect poorly written code has where tech debt and developer morale go in the wrong directions quickly.

This is not me advocating for haphazardly writing code and being complacent with what we do not know. If you've got 30 layers of if statements in your method, I'm inclined to believe that you did something wrong and should have fixed it a long time ago. Getting the job done tomorrow matters as well as getting it done today, usually. You'll never solve for everything, so you always try to solve what matters the most first, and there are times that your application can ""get the job done"" today, but should absolutely not see the light of production until it is completely reworked into a sensible architecture.

The answer to ""Why doesn't this work?"" can very likely be ""Because it's so impossible to understand that we won't know why it fails."" or ""Because this bug introduces a 0.1% chance that the plane slams into the ground upside down and kills everyone on board.""

This is a bit more philosophical, but I am of the mind that you should always have unresolved reasons for why something doesn't work. If you don't, you probably don't know your application very well. This ultimately gets into risk assessment and whether or not the risk/reward is worth it. A tiny risk of a minor issue, like a script running a few seconds slow, may not be worth hours of work. However, a tiny risk of a major disaster, like a plane crash, is unacceptable and must be addressed. Deciding what risks to tackle is a judgment call based on the severity of the potential outcome.

Remember, the definition of what does and does not work varies. You need to be aware of it and set your own standards (at least, as much as you're able to) to ensure that the software you produce is to the quality it needs to be. Knowing the implications of not following a best practice, and accurately determining if it's a meaningful risk, is an extremely delicate decision. You need to know the rules and respect the rules before you go off deciding to intentionally break them.",post,r/learnprogramming,Education,5.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1kumill/when_youre_great_at_programming_but_you_suck_at/

"Best, definitive java/OOP book to read and learn from over the summer? Hello,

I'm a first year CS student and this year we had a java module. The professor really emphasised the fact that we should be reading a book as we go through the 10 weeks of the module, because just lectures wouldn't be enough. He also highly recommended that the book be relatively recent as java is a language that evolves relatively quickly

As you may guess from the title, I did not end up reading a java book during term time (was a bit too caught up on other things) and now that I've finished all my exams for the year, I would like to read a java/oop book over the summer so that I can catch up and apply the knowledge I gain from reading in a personal project I will be working on

The module went fine, I got a good grade on the coursework and think the exam went well enough,  but the issue is that, while I am relatively comfortable with programming in java  from a syntactic standpoint, I am not sure if the programs I would write would be good in design with respect to OOP. I want to be more familiar with OOP and it's principles. I know and am comfortable with the ideas of inheritance, encapsulation, polymorphism, abstraction, programming to an interface etc but I don't feel like I am expert enough to properly know when to make use of them and when to not. Our DSA module was also kinda based on java so I did learn a bit from that

It is important to me that the book isn't just essentially a specification to java (I'm not sure if that's how most books are, haven't looked at the contents of any particular book), I'd like there to be a good amount of explanation and emphasis on the higher level OOP centric ideas and all that. Stuff that I can apply and use not just in java but any other OO language 

We do have a reading list of recommended books, but I don't think it's been updated in a couple years. Most books in it seem to be 5+ years old, and if my professor is right that's probably a bit too old

If anyone has any recommendations, I'd be very grateful. Ive already emailed my professor asking for a recommendation from him, but I'm not 100% sure when he will reply",post,r/learnprogramming,Education,2.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1kuopdo/best_definitive_javaoop_book_to_read_and_learn/

"Longest Increasing Subsequence - Solution better than optimal, which is impossible but I dont know why. TLDR - I have a solution to the Longest Increasing Subsequence (LIS) problem that runs in O(n) time, but Leetcode says the optimal solution is in O(n \* log n) time. I must be missing something but I am unsure where.

Problem: (Copied from Leetcode)

Given an integer array `nums`, return *the length of the longest* ***strictly increasing subsequence***.

 **Example 1:**

    Input:
     nums = [10,9,2,5,3,7,101,18]
    Output:
     4
    Explanation:
     The longest increasing subsequence is [2,3,7,101], therefore the length is 4.
    

**Example 2:**

    Input:
     nums = [0,1,0,3,2,3]
    Output:
     4
    

**Example 3:**

    Input:
     nums = [7,7,7,7,7,7,7]
    Output:
     1

  
Solution: (Logical Explanation)

I was unsure on how to start this problem due to some fairly poor programming skills on my part. I was thinking about the way in which you almost skip over each number that does not fit in the subsequence, and wanted to use that pattern. Also, it seemed nice that the number that gets skipped could be almost anywhere on the total list, but when there is a dip, that means that a number gets skipped, and thus I did not need to keep track of what number is skipped, just that one is skipped. 

My code will take the length of the list of numbers, and each time nums\[n\] is greater than or equal to nums\[n+1\] i subtracted from the length of the nums.

  
Solution: (Python)

    class Solution(object):
        def lengthOfLIS(self, nums):
            """"""
            :type nums: List[int]
            :rtype: int
            """"""
            val = len(nums)
    
            i = 1
            while i < len(nums):
                a = nums[i - 1]
                b = nums[i]
    
    
                if(a >= b):
                    val -= 1
                
                i += 1
    
            return val

My program was able to hit all of the Leetcode tests and pass. 

  
What I need:

My program seems to work, and I messed with random sequences of integers, feeding it to the ""optimal"" solution and my own, and my program worked every time. My question is if I am missing something? Does this always work or have I just not found a example when it fails. Is this a different version of the optimal solution, and I simply did the big O notation wrong, it actually is O(n \* log n)? I really doubt that I found a new best solution for what seems to be a pretty basic and common problem, but I dont know where I failed.

You clicked submit and it passed all the hidden test cases too? If that’s the case what’s your question? If it doesn’t pass all the test cases you need to find the edge case that resulted in the error,comment_2,r/learnprogramming,Education,,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1kukc25/longest_increasing_subsequence_solution_better/
"You should submit the given example cases to Leetcode by reporting the problem. The issue is the test cases are weak and so what is actually a non-solution is passing,

Your solution isnt even really close. Im kind of amazed that the test cases are so bad; it fails to account for descending subsequences that count up for a while. you could have a million elements in the following pattern:

X, X+1, X-2, X-1, X - 4, x - 3...  
Your solution would give the answer 500,000 when the actual answer is 2.

The general form of the above is a sequence \[ x - 2n, x + 1 - 2n... \] for any n.

That said its *very* good of you to recognize that there is seems to be a problem with your code *and* the problem statement itself (or, possibly with the claim about the optimal possible solution).

"I see. There are many resources online but the short version is: the program that reads code and turns it into a program you can run is called a compiler, the two most common compilers for C are called ""gcc"" (the **G**NU **C**ompiler **C**ollection) and Clang. These are just programs you can install and run yourself. And you should!

You say exe, I guess you are on Windows? Maybe what is happening is when you run the .exe directly, Windows creates a Window to show the output in. When your program exits, Windows automatically closes the Window. That's not really a C thing or a VSCode thing, it's a ""how Windows runs programs"" thing. Running things from a terminal will probably avoid that just because the terminal will stay open.

I strongly recommend learning to use a terminal to run a compiler yourself rather than relying on random websites to be able to run your code. At the very least when you have problems it will be helpful if you know how to run the commands yourself, even if just to check the random website did not do it wrong or Windows did not automatically close or delete something.",comment_3,r/learnprogramming,Education,,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1kuoqnk/guys_why_does_ii_keep_crashing_while_iworks/

But if you start adding images, videos, or audio, the size grows quickly. That’s why common practice is to avoid bundling media directly in the repository.

I myself was not introduced to coding until much later in life which I wish I was, stuff would’ve been easier for me. I was thinking of enrolling him into a scratch course to help him get ‘head start’ into the field. He has done some scratch animation projects in school however I came across a course which teaches scratch more in depth with more projects. He said he would be interested in doing it, however I was relaying the information to some people and they’ve said that programming is dead now because of AI and a lot of people are not able to make use of their skills anymore. They said that it’s not worth it to learn how to code. I’m really conflicted because I would like my brother to learn skills early on that will help him in his later schooling and career and he isn’t struggling to grasp basic concepts in college like I was. I still want to enroll him in scratch course because I know in the end he will learn something and it’s worth it rather than him not doing anything at all. I wanted to know if anyone had any advice on how I can help him learn early on about the IT industry, software engineering, etc. so he already has basic knowledge beforehand.

"How to correctly tackle a situation where you have same multiple functions that achieve the same result but SLIGHTLY differ in implementation depending on a specific use case? Consider a react app, i have 6 pages that have similar functionalities but still are fundamentally different in what theyre doing. Every one of them has a helper function called handleAdd() that determines the logic when the user clicks a button.

    function handleAdd(){ <---- Page 1's handle add
      doX()
      doA()
      doY()
    }
    
    function handleAdd(){ <---- Page 2's handle add
      doX()

      doX()
      doC()
      doD()  
      doY()
    }
    
    and so on...

Is the right play here to make a singular function that encapsulates every one of these cases with a bunch of if statements? For example one of the params of that function should be a string determining what page you're on, if case == ""page1""  do page1 logic, if case == ""page2"" etc...

"Built a backend deployment platform – need advice on handling multiple users (apart from Docker) Hey everyone,

I’ve been working on a project(like heroku or render) that lets users deploy their backend apps directly from GitHub repos to live URLs. It handles automatic routing, subdomain mapping, resource limits, and preview deploys — mainly geared toward developers who want a frictionless deployment experience.

Right now, I’m using Docker containers to isolate deployments and manage resources per user, but I’m wondering — what are some other approaches or technologies that can be used to handle multi-user backend hosting efficiently?

Looking for alternatives to Docker (or even ways to improve on top of it) that could scale better, offer better performance, or make things simpler from a DevOps perspective.

"Self-Hosted WebRTC Video Streaming from Phone to Laptop Works in Chrome, Fails in Firefox (WSS Issue?) Good morrow my good people🙃

I’ve set up a self-hosted WebRTC solution to stream my phone’s camera feed to my laptop over LAN using WebSockets (wss://) and HTTPS. The signaling server is running via Python and websockets, and I serve the page using a simple HTTPS server with a self-signed cert (`cert.pem` and `key.pem`).

Here’s the basic setup:

Both phone and laptop access `https://<my-laptop-ip>:4443/index.html?role=caller`

The WebSocket signaling server runs at `wss://<my-laptop-ip>:8765`

The server uses self-signed SSL certs

Chrome works perfectly on both phone and laptop

Firefox fails to establish the WebSocket connection
`Console error:`

`Firefox can’t establish a connection to the server at wss://<my-laptop-ip>:8765.`


Things I’ve tried:

Visited the HTTPS page manually in Firefox and accepted the self-signed cert

Confirmed the cert and key are valid and match

Made sure the WebSocket URL is `wss://` (not `ws://`) and matches the server

The signaling server logs show no connection attempt from Firefox


What am I missing? Is there something Firefox requires that Chrome doesn't for self-signed WSS? Any help or insights would be appreciated",post,r/learnprogramming,Education,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1kujuvy/selfhosted_webrtc_video_streaming_from_phone_to/

"Still don’t fully understand how CORS actually works. I feel its implemented in a weird way.

things I am clear on(I think I am clear) :   
\- If bowsers do strict SOP, it leads to some limitations where genuine cross site requests wouldn't                       work.   
So CORS came in to loosen this up a bit, where the backend when returning a response, adds few headers saying who all can access it.   
But the backend takes the cross site request, runs the request, and sends a proper response like how it would do for a genuine request.  


  
so now I don't understand what if [bank.com](http://bank.com) has some endpoint like /sendmoney, that returns success or failure.  
and [evil.com](http://evil.com) makes cross site request to that endpoint.  
Will the backend still execute the /sendmoney?   
what I understand is, backend does the work and returns response, then browser blocks [evil.com](http://evil.com) from seeing the response(which doesnt matter in this case).

so if this is how it works,   
CORS is to stop [evil.com](http://evil.com) from only viewing resources/responses of [bank.com](http://bank.com)  
it wont stop from making it hit some endpoints?

I have read about CSRF tokens. I feel CSRF token is the real thing, CORS isnt.",post,r/learnprogramming,Education,77.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1ktqklt/still_dont_fully_understand_how_cors_actually/
"For GET requests, the CORS header is part of the response which the browser uses to determine if it should let the client see it.

"Backend will respond to any request it's given.. CORS on the backend is basically just passing instructions to the browser. Your browser will prevent evil.com from making a request to bank.com unless it's explicitly allowed.

"To be a bit pedantic, a POST request is not always preceded by an OPTION, as, [under certain circumstances](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Guides/CORS#simple_requests), it's considered a ""simple request"".",comment_3,r/learnprogramming,Education,,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1ktqklt/still_dont_fully_understand_how_cors_actually/
"CORS does fully block some requests. For example, you cannot send an application/json POST with credentials to a cross-domain endpoint unless the server allows it via CORS. In that case, it's not only that the client cannot see the response, but the browser also won't send the POST request in the first place unless the server first allows it via CORS headers in response to an OPTIONS preflight request.

That's not true for all POST requests though. Form POSTs specifically predate CORS and developers have always been allowed to submit a form to another domain by simply creating `<form action=""bank.com/...` HTML and either tricking the user into clicking the submit button or submitting automatically with JS. This wouldn't allow an attacker to see the response to a cross-domain form post, but it would allow you to make the cross-domain form post. Browsers retained this capability because they didn't want to break all the legitimate websites that rely on this behavior to this day.

This is why you need anti-csrf tokens to hand form POSTs. I think https://smagin.fyi/posts/cross-site-requests/ is a great summary on why we have both CSRF protections and CORS. It's mostly history. We wouldn't have done it this way from scratch. https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43231411 also has some comments on the blog post.",comment_4,r/learnprogramming,Education,,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1ktqklt/still_dont_fully_understand_how_cors_actually/
"What helped me understand CORS was to anthropomorphize the three parties involved.

The server, always says ""Here's my response, whoever sent that request I don't care, whatever.""

The browser says ""I have received your response in its entirety. I sent that request- me, a browser. Twas a script on Evil.com that summoned me to make that request. But as a matter of protocol, I shan't divulge your response to that script.""

Adding CORs headers to the evil.com script is like saying ""browser bruh, can you make this request to bank.com for me and share the response when you get it? Pleaaaase? I need it."" And the browser says ""I shall, but only with the proper decree; if explicitly stated from bank.com that I am allowed, then I will.""

Adding CORs header to the server is similar to before but now the server's like ""here's my response, whoever sent that request I don't care, whatever.

Second owl, I think, is ""productionalizing.""

"Is there any GUI debugger for Linux at all, that isn't impossible to install without hunting down exact versions of build tools and libraries? On Windows, I have RemedyBG, it was the best $30 I've spent. Despite being developed by a single person (to my knowledge), it's far better than anything Microsoft has to offer. I only once saw a video describing some of its functions, and I can find anything I need there.

Meanwhile on Linux I couldn't find anything like that easily, only CLI based ones. Every time I try to use GDB, I have to google 5-10 minutes for each basic functionality, which might get even worse in the future thanks to genAI slop articles, and I never could find a way to break on a single keypress, which is easily available on Windows, and would be needed for a soon to be 1 year old bug to be fixed.

I tried to build multiple GUI frontends, but both Kdbg and Seer needs the same exact build tool and library versions as the developers had, and I don't have the energy to hunt down them, nor to learn how to get that working on my virtual machine.

"Apprenticeship or self-guided? Hi all,

I’ve been looking at taking a level 6 data science apprenticeship through work I’ve always been interested in completing a degree but now the possibility has come into fruition I’m overthinking it. 

I work mainly with spreadsheets in my day job, no programming but I’ve been completing CS50X alongside my job and I love programming and the problem solving aspect of it. I like to think I see my future in continuing to build projects and get a career solidly in tech. 

My dialemma is with most of the apprenticeships it won’t be until I’m in my early-mid 30s that I will finish. Ive also completed exams before (albeit in a subject I wasn’t too interested in) and I felt paralysed in having guilt if I had time off from studying. I appreciate this would be slightly different as my exams I had to book in my own time and complete as I felt whereas a L6 would be more structured. 

I don’t want to waste 4 years of my life if the piece of paper at the end will make no difference and I have to go to a Junior role on (I’m assuming) under 35k and I can make my way into this career on my own based off a portfolio in a shorter time.

"Why do venomous Snakes have such potent venom but they mostly hunt tiny rats and mice and stuff? I just don't get it, why have a venom so potent that it could kill hundreds of people in such low doses to kill a small rodent?",post,r/AskScience,Education,1142.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/1kta37d/why_do_venomous_snakes_have_such_potent_venom_but/
"One thing to keep in mind is that they need that venom to work extremely quickly against their intended prey. A snake bite from some species might be fatal to a 150-200 lb human, but it may take many minutes or even hours for that to happen, while the human can escape over that time (or at least a portion of it).

For their prey animals, they don't want to bite it, inject a costly (metabolically) venom, and have it scurry away into a burrow and die out of reach (or snatched up by some other scavenger/predator). The venom needs to paralyze them very quickly to be effective. So even though it may be a fatal dose to us, it's more about how fast it acts on their prey.",comment_1,r/AskScience,Education,,https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/1kta37d/why_do_venomous_snakes_have_such_potent_venom_but/
"Adding to this, very important to consider both heart rate and mass of the target animal.

Most snake venoms are neurotoxins. The objective is to disrupt the nervous system, paralyze the heart and lungs, and prevent oxygenated blood from reaching the brain. The larger the mass of the animal, the longer that takes because the nervous system is larger and the heartbeat is generally less rapid. You can clearly see this by [comparing the ""resting heart rate"" of a horse or elephant to a hamster or rat](https://www.merckvetmanual.com/multimedia/table/resting-heart-rates).

So smaller animal plus faster circulation of venom through the body = faster death.

Finally, most snakes capable of killing AND EATING a small human, or any complementary-sized mammal, kill by constriction. Not venom. The reason why humans get killed by rattlesnakes and cobras is because they're *reacting to defend themselves*, not because they want to use their venom to kill you.",comment_2,r/AskScience,Education,,https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/1kta37d/why_do_venomous_snakes_have_such_potent_venom_but/
"In the case of the inland taipan - the worlds most venomous snake - it’s venom is so strong/concentrated because it lives in a place with scarce resources. So it needs to be efficient with venom production and use.

Venom takes a lot of resources for its body to make. And when the snake goes for a kill, it also needs that venom to be effective.

This leads to a situation where it has evolved very concentrated venom so it doesn’t have to use much of it for guaranteed lethal dose.

A fast knock-down also plays a role in ensuring that the prey doesn’t run off and die far away when envenomated.

"Why do different spicy ingredients have different effects? Some spicy ingredients are « hot » and others « spicy », some hit the back of the throat whereas some are generalized in the mouth, some seem to linger forever while others fade quickly.
Why do these effects happen? And what are the chemical components behind each « family » of effect?",post,r/AskScience,Education,115.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/1kti2pd/why_do_different_spicy_ingredients_have_different/
"Edited: Expanded and corrected to answer the points and comments expressed below.

There’s a receptor that causes the spiciness perception or sensation, called TRPV1. This class of receptors categorically is involved in the perception of heat, pain, pressure, and sensitivity. This is mostly activated by the conventional spicy compound, capsaicin. However, other compounds with similar structures, such as gingerol (ginger), piperine (black pepper), allicin (garlic), and allyl isothiocyanate (wasabi).

Each of these transiently interact with the TRPV1 receptor in different ways, some more intensely than others. Also, the solubility of these compounds in saliva and skin tissue plays a role as well. Molecular size and ability to interact with proteins also plays a role too.

The main trigger point is a cysteine inside the cavity of TRPV1. Compounds with molecular structures that react or interact with that cysteine will trigger the heat or pain sensation, usually through direct modification, alkylation, thiolation, or a Michael addition reaction.

As someone else noted, there’s also TRPA1, which has a different affinity and sensation than TRPV1. The sensations related to TRPA1 are more associated with noxious compounds, cold, pain, and itchiness. This receptor is more likely to respond to compounds structurally similar to the ones found in wasabi and mustard, activating more of the teary effect.

Again, part of the response is triggered by an alkylating or electrophilic reaction to residues in the receptor cavity, although there is more complicated effects that may be mediated by molecular mechanics and sterics, as not all compounds that activate the receptor react directly with the interior of the receptor.

These two receptors have a non-uniform expression throughout the human oropharynx and larynx. TRPV1 is more heavily expressed on the surface of the tongue, whereas TRPA1 is localized in the basal lamina.

Some compounds also are more volatile than others, so they are more likely to enter through the nasal passages retronasally and activate receptors there. For example, allyl isothiocyanate and allicin have enough vapor pressure at room temperature to enter in the nasal passages, whereas capsaicin is fairly oily and bound to its liquid form with very little existing in the vapor state.

Being fairly oily, it is much more difficult for saliva to dissolve and remove the capsaicin molecule from the receptor regions of the oral cavity, so its effects are longer lived.. On the other hand, compounds like allyl isothiocyanate and allicin are very water soluble, so their effects are much more short-lived. Allicin and allyl isothiocyanate are also more chemically unstable and will break down into other compounds in the presence of proteins and other biological material, whereas capsaicin is much more chemically stable and will persist in a biological environment.

These properties are going to cause each difference class of spicy compound to be distributed in various ways and chemical velocities, much like the way compounds are transported in thin layer chromatography.

Interesting study here on locations of these two receptors:

https://doi.org/10.1111/nmo.12701",comment_1,r/AskScience,Education,,https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/1kti2pd/why_do_different_spicy_ingredients_have_different/
">There’s a receptor that causes the spiciness perception or sensation, called TRPV.

It's TRPV1, not just TRPV receptors in general. TRPV1 is not the only receptor that senses pungent/spicy compounds. Allyl isothiocyanate, for example, is also sensed by the TRPA1 receptor, which is otherwise involved in sensing stress from chemical, mechanical or probably cold. That's why wasabi doesn't just feel hot, but also sort of cold/odd in its pungency.",comment_2,r/AskScience,Education,,https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/1kti2pd/why_do_different_spicy_ingredients_have_different/
"There's an issue of semantics here - people conflate ""spice"" with heat, which are two completely different things. ""Spice"" represents a flavouring agent, informed primarily by your sense of taste (e.g. the primary five tastes: salty/sour/sweet/bitter/savoury) and a wide variety of other flavours brought out by your sense of smell (e.g. pungent garlic or onion flavours, ""fruity"" and ""floral"" flavours, nutty flavours, etc).

The sensation of heat represents a specific response noted by u/UpSaltOS that can be activated by a number of different compounds from different foods.

"Mustard's (and horseradish as well as wasabi) spiciness is due to a molecule that is relatively small and volatile, meaning it will evaporate in your mouth and, by you breathing through the nose, be transported to your nose where it causes that pain sensation. You can try this out - next time you eat mustard or wasabi, breath through your mouth (if necessary, you can hold your nose shut with your fingers) and you will feel almost no pain there.

"Most ""pure"" molecules will be white. The more complex the molecule, this may not be true.

One reason I know is due to molecules not being able to absorb photons of low wavelength (visible light), as the energy difference between where electrons are excited to is too large.

A good example of this is beta-carotene (vitamin A precursor). This is the orange in carrots. This molecule has many conjugated double bonds, which ultimately lowers this energy difference between ground and excited electron states. Since these states are closer together, a photon of lower wavelength (visible light) can excite electrons in these conjugated double bonds. This is the absorbance that you heard of if/when you learned about where color comes from in school.

As a result, we see the complimentary color of whatever wavelength the molecule absorbs. Take beta carotene from before, the decrease in energy levels leads to the molecule being able to absorb photons in the blue visible light region of the electromagnetic spectrum. Ultimately leading to the orange colors of carrots (which is complimentary color of blue).",comment_5,r/AskScience,Education,,https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/1ksf7zy/if_you_had_a_whole_bunch_of_pure_vitamin_d_what/

"Hair, feathers, lizard scales and teeth are all derived from scale development in jawed fish. During embryonic development at regular spacing across the skin, raised thickened bumps form called placodes form. If you're a jawed fish these become fish scales. If you're a lizard the placode differentiates it to a different form of scale and some of these scales are tipped with a sensory bristle. Over further evolutionary time this sensory bristle has enlarged and differentiated in to hair or feathers (in mammals and birds respectively) while the scale portion no longer forms. Placodes are very temporary developmental features and do not persist very long in the embryo, they stick around longest in mammal hair formation which is where they were discovered but are very transient in lizard scales and feathers. They are so transient they were only observed in lizard embryos for the first time about 10 years ago. It was already known that scales, feather and hair development was under the control of the same genes, observing that placodes also form in lizards and birds is just further evidence these _are_ derived from the same evolved structures

"How does the human brain distinguish between different types of pain? I’ve been reading a lot about how pain is processed in the brain, and I’m curious about how our brains can differentiate between types of pain. For example, the sharp, immediate pain from cutting your finger seems very different from the dull, aching pain of a sore muscle. I’ve heard that there are different types of pain receptors and pathways involved, but I’m not sure exactly how that works.

What mechanisms or systems allow our brains to recognize these different types of pain, and how does that affect how we experience and respond to them? Would love to hear your thoughts on the science behind this!",post,r/AskScience,Education,44.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/1kroi84/how_does_the_human_brain_distinguish_between/
"The brain distinguishes between different types of pain through a combination of specialized receptors, nerve fibers, and brain regions that process sensory information in different ways. When you experience pain, it starts with nociceptors. These are specialized nerve endings located throughout the body. These nociceptors are tuned to respond to specific stimuli like mechanical pressure, temperature changes, or chemical signals from injured tissue. For instance, cutting your finger activates mechanical nociceptors, while sore muscles from overuse might trigger chemical or inflammatory nociceptors.

Once activated, these nociceptors send signals through different types of nerve fibers. A-delta fibers are thin and myelinated, meaning they conduct signals quickly. They’re responsible for the sharp, immediate pain you feel right after an injury—like the sting from a cut. In contrast, C fibers are unmyelinated and slower, carrying dull, throbbing, or burning sensations. These contribute to the lingering ache or soreness that follows.

The signals from these fibers enter the spinal cord and travel upward to the brain via pathways like the spinothalamic tract. Along the way, they synapse with other neurons and are modulated before reaching the brain. Once they arrive, several areas contribute to how pain is processed. The thalamus acts as a relay station, distributing the signals to other regions. The somatosensory cortex helps localize the pain and determine its intensity. Other regions like the anterior cingulate cortex and insula are more involved in the emotional and affective components. This is why pain can feel unpleasant or distressing. The prefrontal cortex helps assess the context, adding meaning or urgency depending on the situation.

Pain perception is also influenced by descending pathways from the brain that can either amplify or dampen pain signals. These are affected by factors like stress, attention, mood, and previous experiences. The brain also releases natural chemicals like endorphins that can reduce the sensation of pain.

Together, these mechanisms explain why the brain can clearly distinguish between a quick, sharp pain and a dull, persistent ache. Each type of pain activates different fibers, engages different brain circuits, and carries different biological meanings. This helps the body respond appropriately, whether it’s pulling away quickly or protecting a sore area over time.",comment_1,r/AskScience,Education,,https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/1kroi84/how_does_the_human_brain_distinguish_between/

"> As in, if I got a coral budd Y shaped, would the coral grow downward and the Y would be the tip or would it grow upwards from the ""v"" part in two directions, like a plant?

This happens all the time, in storms, and it's not just a key strategy for survival but a means of expanding to new areas. Coral fragments will break off and settle to the bottom. As long as they don't get buried by shifting sediment or carried into a hostile environment (think: starvation/ overcompetition/ nutrient overloading, etc.) they'll continue growing toward the sunlight, changing their growth direction if they've been flipped over. You may be familiar with table corals, the giant wide plates anchored by a central stem? In high surf environments it's common to see these flipped upside down, and sprouting new growth upward from the former underside. It will eventually become cemented to the seafloor, either by active growth on its part, or by getting crusted over by calcareous algae that is forever growing and cementing things together on reefs.

They can persist after breakage because their base is just a support structure, not a feeding mechanism like in plants. Most corals in the tropics get their energy in two ways: photosynthesis, and active filter-feeding of tiny particles of organic material suspended in the soup of ocean water. They get their minerals from the sea water itself, among which are dissolved bicarbonate & calcium ions, which they expend their energy to combine into a form of calcium carbonate called aragonite, similar to limestone.

The benefits of this are two fold: it builds a tiny castle wall around each coral polyp into which it can retract for protection (remember, corals are colonial organisms, or collections of zillions of individuals living side by side and sharing resources); and it perpetuates the coral's relentless growth upward & outward, as it competes with its neighboring colonies for space & sunlight. Only the outside few millimeters of a coral is alive; the interior of a giant colony - while it may host a multitude of organisms - is nonliving mineral material. You can see this if you saw through a coral skeleton, because much like on a tree, you'll see annual growth rings. The oldest living coral is thought to be 4000 years old!!

"Former Reef Aquarium Hobbyist here:

Corals propagate like plants and trees. They feed themselves in several different ways, but it is usually from an exchange of beneficial nutrients the coral self produces as a reaction to sunlight.

Where do those nutrients come from? The ocean!

The ocean is not just salt and H2O. There is a complex mix of other essential building blocks for corals (calcium, etc). The coral thrive on this balance and use it and sunlight to grow!

Edit:

Many corals have feeding polyps that are like little hands which reach out and grab particulates in the ocean current also. 

In the ReefTank (aquarium hobby), you see corals separated into three groups: soft corals, large polyp corals, and small polyp corals. Each feeds slightly different (eg you could “feed” large polyp corals larger pieces of aquarium food), but in the wild they rely on the combination of sunlight, ocean nutrients, and pieces of detritus/stuff that float in the water column).",comment_3,r/AskScience,Education,,https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/1kr8h39/how_do_corals_grow/
"Acropora cytheria is a favorite of mine. Probably the most common of the table corals I mentioned, it's an incredibly prolific grower, both in terms of global distribution and fast linear growth. At first glance it's fragile and prone to breakage, but I love that this is actually an adaptive strategy, as described above, and its role in reef-building processes can't be overstated. Plus, it does best in crystal clear waters, and I have fond memories diving on near-pristine oceanic reefs early in my career.

But I can't pick just one: flower cup corals (Tubastraea coccinea) and blue rice coral (Montipora flabellata) are delightful for the surprise of their dazzling color. Mushroom coral, or fungiidae, are super cool - they're individual giant polyps (up to 15cm/6"" across!) with calcium carbonate blades arranged radially, much as you'd see gills arranged on the underside of a terrestrial mushroom. While often growing in clusters, they're usually unattached to one another or the seafloor, defying the conventional colonial growth form of corals. Again, their colors are ridiculous, ranging from iridescent purple, pink & green, but muted by their translucent fleshy covering.

All of the above are from the Pacific, and I have to give a shout out to Caribbean brain corals like Diploria labyrinthiformis. They're super trippy looking.

 I'll pick 3 facts: 

- Stony corals are incredibly plastic in their growth forms, within the same species. While colonies of a certain species generally tend to the same structure, the very same species can take on completely different shapes depending on its age and environment. 'Species' previously separated taxonomically based on their morphology had to be merged into a single species once we developed the ability to test genetics. Some species may resemble a golf ball when small, then a pillar, then antlers, then a table. Some species are forced to hunker into a stout, rounded shape in areas of high surf, but proliferate into delicate folds and extensions in a protected lagoon.
- Charles Darwin, long a hero of mine for his deductive reasoning and deep thinking about ecological processes, wrote the authoritative manuscript on coral reefs based on his first-person observations  while sailing the tropics aboard the *HMS Beagle*. So keen were his powers of observation during a time of limited technology, he - a son of gloomy England with limited exposure to coral reefs - was able to correctly deduce that their aggregated behavior over the course of millennia was responsible for producing the dazzling array of coral reefs and lagoons throughout the Pacific, at a time when any number of competing theories seemed equally plausible.
- Corals are a symbiosis of plant & animal. While they can & do scavenge for food by grabbing/inhaling plankton and dissolved organic matter, most species today satisfy most of their metabolic needs by providing a comfortable home for algae. These algae, called zooxanthellae, turn sunlight to glucose (which the corals then consume), and are adapted to specific wavelengths of sunlight depending on their typical environmental conditions, host's growth form, and accidents of evolution. This 'tuning' to specific wavelengths is what causes them to absorb some colors & reflect others - in other words, this algae is what gives corals their striking array of colors. Corals are even able to adapt to changing conditions by ejecting one subspecies of algae for another better suited for new conditions. Coral bleaching events are the result of zooxanthellae ejection, usually triggered by overheating. Sometimes the corals find more suitable species and recover, sometimes they don't and they die.",comment_4,r/AskScience,Education,,https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/1kr8h39/how_do_corals_grow/

"No. 

Strictly speaking, capsaicin is not a toxin, it’s an irritant used by plants to deter seed-digesting mammals while not affecting other animals, like seed-spreading birds. So unlike, say, cardiac glycosides, its efficacy would be much more limited. It doesn’t target any essential body systems, it makes temperature sensors fire at lower temperature than they should.

It would make the eater sick much faster than it would build up. While oil-soluble and thus not easy to excrete, it could not build up inside humans because it is [rather quickly metabolized in the liver](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4267963/). 

This tracks because it has a rather simple hydrocarbon tail. The toxins you are comparing it to tend to be polycyclic molecules like cardenosides used by monarch butterflies, or the batrachotoxin used by poison dart frogs.

We would have to change so that it doesn’t hurt us, we would have to stop metabolizing it, and ideally develop some pathway(s) to intentionally keep it in our tissues. It would take such an alteration of human biochemistry that it would be better and simpler to hypothesize about some other, better molecule entirely. I don’t want to be immune to capsaicin.

Probably the most straight forward ""equation"" for this would be something more like:

∑N ∝ T*_R_*

Where ∑N is the cumulative sum of CO*_2_* emissions and T*_R_* is the average temperature anomaly relative to a preindustrial baseline. I.e., there is effectively a linear relationships between these two quantities which has been known for quite a while, e.g., [Figure SPM.10 on page 28 of this IPCC report (pdf)](https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg1/downloads/report/IPCC_AR6_WGI_SPM.pdf). The rates of emissions *now* are not necessarily going to match the rate of temperature change because the warming effect is basically cumulative, not a direct response to emissions happening right now. Put another way, warming right now reflects an integrated average of past emissions over a time window, so the current rate of emissions will not map directly into the current rate of warming (but will certainly play into a future rate of warming).

>In other words, if we stopped all of our industrial greenhouse gas emissions, would global warming stop or continue at a constant rate since we haven't removed the greenhouse gases we have already put in the atmosphere?

Depends on the timescale you're asking about. This point has been covered in a variety of past answers here on AskScience, e.g., [this one](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/1e7m31k/how_long_will_climate_change_affect_humanity/) or [this other one](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/1c7ge65/is_climate_change_reversible_or_is_our_goal_to/), but as discussed in those past answers, simulations like those found in [Lenton et al., 2006](https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/379843.pdf) are instructive. In that paper, they simulate a variety of future emissions scenarios with different timing and magnitudes of CO*_2_* emissions and different timing for cessation of all emissions (Figure 1) and then modeled average temperatures in response to those different emission scenarios (Figure 2). In detail, they use two different models to estimate temperature and we can see that the exact projection depends on the model, but that broadly for all scenarios (1) temperature continues to rise for some period after decline and/or cessation of emissions and (2) then eventually stabilizes to some static (but higher) global average temperature after a delay from the total cessation of emissions. As also discussed in those past posts (and in a *hyper simplified way*), what this reflects is that there is effectively an expected equilibrium average temperature for a given average CO*_2_* concentration in the atmosphere (the static global average the models eventually reach), but after a change in CO*_2_* concentration, the response is not immediate, i.e., there is a time lag.

So, returning to the original question, and keeping things *very simple*. If we stopped all emissions tomorrow, warming would continue for a period until the average temperature approached what the appropriate equilibrium temperature would be for that total greenhouse gas concentration and then that new higher average temperature would generally be maintained until something else changed (e.g., natural or anthropogenic removal of CO*_2_* from the atmosphere would start a similar delayed decline in temperature to a new, lower equilibrium). It is worth remembering as well that there are a tons of details, feedbacks, etc., here that *really matter a lot* and that could similarly complicate this simple answer *a lot*. One example of this is that there is a lot of work to suggest that climate systems experience ""hysteresis"", i.e., at this point, even if we took CO*_2_* concentrations back down to pre-industrial levels, (1) the path ""down"" in terms of climatic variables like temperature and precipitation would not be the same as the path up and (2) the new equilibrium would likely be different than the original equilibrium (e.g., [Kim et al., 2022](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1038/s41558-022-01452-z)).",comment_1,r/AskScience,Education,,https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/1kq79cw/is_the_rate_of_global_warming_proportional_to_the/
"The temperature of the Earth is a result of the rate of energy arriving from the Sun (which may not be perfectly constant but isn't significantly variable, or under our control) and the rate of energy radiating away from the Earth into space. 

An increased concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere will slow down the rate of heat loss. A higher average temperature increases the rate of heat loss. So for any given CO2 concentration, there's an equilibrium temperature where the rate of loss will equal the rate of inflow. But there can be a long lag between the CO2 concentration increasing and the temperature rising to a new equilibrium, because even while the rate of heat loss is less than the rate of heat arriving, there's a huge thermal mass that doesn't change temperature instantly.

If we stop all new emissions and the concentration in the atmosphere stays stable, warming will continue in the short term, until that equilibrium temperature is reached. Over the much longer term, halting emissions may eventually result in CO2 concentrations falling, as (slow) natural processes take some carbon out of the atmosphere (unless there are feedback loops triggered by high temperatures which cause further naturally-occurring emissions).",comment_2,r/AskScience,Education,,https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/1kq79cw/is_the_rate_of_global_warming_proportional_to_the/

Those feedback loops?

Yea, two of the three are already beyond the point of no return now, and the third is ""Might be, our estimates aren't precise enough yet.""

"Not really. A simple analogy would be water pouring into a bucket with a drain. In a pre-industrial state (and over a geologically short period of time), the level of water in the bucket (i.e., CO*_2_* concentration in the atmosphere) was static as the rate of water being poured in (i.e., natural sources of CO*_2_* emissions to the atmosphere) was largely balanced by the rate of water draining out (i.e., natural sinks of CO*_2_* that remove it from the atmosphere). Over geologic time, the level of water in the bucket has changed as the rates of both water being poured in and water drained out have changed (not necessarily in concert), but changes in either tend to occur slowly and there are a variety of hard limits on the (natural) rates of water being poured in or drained out that have kept water level broadly within a pretty narrow range (at least if we're talking the last few million years). Anthropogenic CO*_2_* emissions are a large, constant, extra spigot of water being added to the bucket at a rate that outpaces the rate of water draining out, i.e., the CO*_2_* concentrations in the atmosphere are rising because of sustained extra emissions.

In the context of our analogy, when we talk about CO*_2_* residence time (i.e., it stays in the atmosphere for X years), what we're really talking about is the average time it takes for a drop of water that enters the bucket (whether it comes from the ""natural"" spigot or the ""anthropogenic"" spigot) to eventually leave the bucket via the drain. So even if some of that industrial CO*_2_* is finally being taken out of the atmosphere, it's being replaced by both natural and continued anthorpogenic emissions that are still outpacing the rate of removal.",comment_4,r/AskScience,Education,,https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/1kq79cw/is_the_rate_of_global_warming_proportional_to_the/
"It's not anywhere as simple as a direct relationship, but I'll try to point you in the right direction.

The concepts you are asking about is Earth Energy Imbalance / Budget. This is the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth%27s_energy_budget

Also take a look at climate sensitivity https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_sensitivity

This is measured in Watts per square meter, at the moment it is around 1W per suare meter, or 460TW / 5 nukes a second. (though some, notably James Hansen, puts it much higher). It measures the net energy increase of the Earth over time. Energy in (sunlight) minus energy out (radiative heat + reflected light).

We have decreased the radiative heat with extra greenhouse gases. Reflected light (measured as albedo) is more complicated, we have increased it with areosols, and also decreased it with land use. It is also a variable which will change over time as the planet warms (for example ice caps melting and reflecting less light back into space)

The Earth energy increase is not directly proportional to increases in atmospheric temperature. Nearly all of the extra energy absorbed by the Earth in the last 100 odd years has been absorbed by the oceans which have a thermal mass orders of magnitude larger than the astmosphere.

The Earth's total energy will continue to increase until the energy out matches the energy in. This could happen by increased radiative forcing (hotter surface temperatures, more heat lost to space) and / or increased reflected light (more clouds / bigger icecaps / areosols in the atmosphere)

So in rough answer to your questions:

Earth energy imbalance ∝ N

and dT/dt is a rounding error in Earth energy imbalance

If we stopped now global warming would increase in rate for decades, and then slowly decline (still increasing in temperature but at a slower rate) over centuries until the Earth reaches energy equilibrium.",comment_5,r/AskScience,Education,,https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/1kq79cw/is_the_rate_of_global_warming_proportional_to_the/

"Yes and no.

The gene that gives the bacteria a resistance might become less prevalent if the antibiotic isn't used for a sufficiently long time, and yes in theory one type of mutation and adaptation to a antibiotic could undo another antibiotic resistance, but that's not very likely.

However it is extremely unlikely the adaptation will die out entirely. It will likely resurface pretty quickly if that antibiotic starts being used again.

I will say, I worked at a pesticide company for a while and they actually relied on this to some extent with their products. They would create artificial lifecycles of certain pesticides to reduce the likelihood of resistance. When resistance was observed, they would often phase out the product for a decade or two and wait for the resistance to be less prevalent. They did have some success with this tactic, though they found that resistance came back much more quickly the second time than the first. 

They would also buy the formulations for older pesticides from other companies that had become useless due to resistances and would sit on them for a while. This actually had been their primary strategy for a while as it seriously cut down on research costs and development.

But a small portion of the population often maintains it anyway, so if you apply the pressure again the population can regrow from the survivors as resistant unless it's a total wipeout. 


But if the resistance is something like a receptor mutating to not bind to the antibiotic anymore, well, that's not really energetically expensive to maintain like a plasmid, so that's more likely to just be a new population default. ",comment_4,r/AskScience,Education,,https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/1kohejx/does_antibiotic_resistance_ever_undo_itself/

"We do things differently. With a presumed empty stomach, after the hypnotic medication is given, we will mask ventilate the lungs until the paralytic kicks in. That's usually 1-3 minutes. There is a risk of insufflating the stomach during this time which increases the potential for aspiration (more pressure against the lower esophageal sphincter). BTW, restricting oral intake reduces but does not eliminate the possibility of having stomach contents.

For emergency operations, the risk of gastric contents being present and aspirated is much higher. We don't mask ventilate after induction. We use larger doses of paralytic so it works faster, or we use different medications like succinylcholine. The risk is that we have much less time to intubate vs mask ventilating. Patients undergoing emergency surgery are frequently going to have other conditions that increase aspiration risk. Things like a bowel obstruction, or internal bleeding, or increased intracranial pressure, etc.

"Is my understanding correct, kind of translated into layman’s terms?:

Typically you give a paralytic which is needed for intubation. With an empty stomach, you can put a mask on the face to pump air into the lungs until the paralytic takes effect and you can then intubate. The mask air will push against the stomach as well and could possibly cause stomach contents to go into the lungs, which is why it’s recommended the stomach be empty.

When the stomach is not empty, the risk that giving air via the face mask will cause the stomach to release contents up and into the lungs is much, much higher. So you have to skip the face mask part and go right for paralytics that act faster, so that you can intubate ASAP.

">I have not heard of new volcanoes forming in this current age, (which I could be wrong about, I don’t keep up with volcano news lol) but I think it’s still technically possible.

There is nothing that precludes a new volcano from forming in any place with the right conditions (more on that in a bit). Not sure what your definition of ""in this current age"" is, but features like [Parícutin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Par%C3%ADcutin) and [Shōwa-shinzan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sh%C5%8Dwa-shinzan) are good examples of very recent, effectively new volcanic edifices, which are both less than 100 years old.

>I know that volcanic eruptions occur when magma seeps upwards to the earths surface from plate tectonics. 

It's worth making sure we're starting from the right underlying premises. The way this is phrased could be read as implying that there is generally magma *everywhere* at some depth and that where you have active volcanism at the surface reflects some sort of tectonic related process that allows this magma to make it to the surface. It's a common misconception, but it's completely wrong. In reality, magma is actually relatively rare and reflects very specific conditions that allow it to form. Put another way, besides the [outer core](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth%27s_outer_core), virtually all of the interior of the Earth is solid. The simple version is that even though the temperature of the interior of the Earth increases with depth (i.e., [Earth's geothermal gradient](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geothermal_gradient)), the melting point of a material is a function of both temperature *and pressure*, and generally, as pressure goes up (which it does with depth because of the mass of material above a given point in the Earth), melting temperature goes up. Most of the Earth is at a temperature and pressure as a function of depth where the temperature is below the melting point of the material in question. Melt (i.e., magma) is only formed in *very specific* locations where something different allows the melting temperature to be exceeded, for example water is added (water lowers the melting temperature) or the material is moved toward the surface quickly (i.e., pressure is reduced). Most of the processes that generate melt are related to plate tectonics, i.e., specific tectonic ""environments"" change [something about the background conditions to bring the rocks above their melting temperatures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partial_melting#/media/File:Partial_melting_asthenosphere_EN.svg), allowing magma to form.

>Last night, I was having a drunk argument with my friend about whether or not mountains could turn into volcanoes. How Machu Picchu mountain could at some point in the future turn into a volcano because it is in an area with a lot of volcanoes and was actually formed from magma hardening from a nearby volcano.

>My point was that while technically volcano formation is not limited to just mountains, but I thought they could form in any location of the earth’s surface at the boundaries of the earth’s tectonic plates, which Machu Picchu mountain is at those boundaries. 

Considering the above, and at a *very simple* level, if the right conditions exist that allow the melting temperature to be exceeded, magma will form. Generally, those conditions tend to exist at specific types of plate boundaries, but *not all*. Looking back at the diagram linked in the previous bit, we can see that at some divergent boundaries (i.e., most [mid-ocean ridges](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mid-ocean_ridge) for sure, and some portions of other types of [rifts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rift)) and some convergent boundaries (i.e., many [subduction zones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subduction) and a few continent-continent collisions) we could expect conditions that are able to generate magma, but transform boundaries (like the San Andreas or oceanic transforms between mid-ocean ridge segments) will generally not be areas where magma will be generated. There can also be areas where magma can be generated away from plate boundaries, like [hotspots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hotspot_%28geology%29) (e.g., Hawaii). Finally, it's worth clarifying that ""able to generate melt"" is not always equal to ""able to generate an eruption"". There needs to be the right mix of volume of melt generated (per unit time), properties of the melt (e.g., crystal to liquid ratio, gas content, viscosity, etc.), depth of melt formation, and details of the material above the melt (e.g., strain rate, etc.) for melt to actually erupt and form some kind of volcanic system as opposed to simply crystallize in the crust as an [intrusion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Igneous_intrusion). This also likely brings up questions about depth of magma that generate volcanoes and, unsurprisingly, there is no simple, single answer. I'll [refer to this past AskScience thread on that particular subject instead of rehashing](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/1ac63t9/where_is_the_magma_in_a_volcano/).

In terms of the specific example of Machu Picchu, given its context within the [Andes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andes) and more specifically the [Andean Volcanic Belt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andean_Volcanic_Belt), at first blush it would be reasonable to think that there is nothing *specific* to preclude an active volcano from developing here. In detail though, Machu Picchu lies right at the southern edge of the [Peruvian volcanic gap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andean_Volcanic_Belt#Peruvian_gap), basically a section along the Andean margin where the specific details of the current subducting slab *do not* lead to conditions that form eruptable melt, i.e., no active volcanoes (largely thought to result because of [flat slab subduction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flat_slab_subduction) in this area). So ultimately, it's probably unlikely that a volcano would form at Machu Picchu without some underlying change in the subducting slab geometry, though it's location is kind of just barely within the Peruvian gap, and is close to the northern edge of the [Central Volcanic Zone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andean_Volcanic_Belt#Central_Volcanic_Zone), so a lot comes down to exactly where the edge of the flat-slab segment is with respect to Machu Picchu (and I'll leave that detail to someone who either is more familiar with central Andean tectonics than I or who wants to dig through the literature on it).

>My question is basically can a volcano erupt on top of a mountain to essentially turn that non-volcano mountain into a volcano? Or are new volcano formations only limited to lower terrain?

Leaving behind the specific Machu Picchu example, if the conditions are right, there's nothing to preclude a volcano from forming at high elevation. Going back to the examples we started with of young volcanoes, Parícutin formed effectively on top of an [existing volcanic plateau](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexican_Plateau) that was > 1 km in elevation. Probably even better examples of what you're asking about can be found in other mountain ranges though. The two that spring to mind are [Mount Elbrus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Elbrus) and [Mount Kazbegi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Kazbek) in the Greater Caucasus. These are two effectively isolated, relatively young volcanoes that formed near the crest of the (otherwise mostly non-volcanic) Greater Caucasus mountains. The surrounding average elevation of the areas that host these volcanoes are ~4 km above sea level. Given that neither the paleoelevation history of the Caucasus or the eruptive history of either of these volcanoes is *that well constrained*, we can't say for sure that these volcanoes started to form when the average elevation was that high, but they definitely formed after significant mountain building had already occurred in this region, so they definitely formed at high elevation in a general sense.",comment_1,r/AskScience,Education,,https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/1kp0x2i/can_a_volcano_form_on_top_of_a_mountain_that_is/

"Let’s do a simulation. You make a cake in a dish with highly compacted biscuit/cookie crumbs with chocolate chips thrown in that are solidified by a mix of caramel and chocolate. The surface is not even so you have some mountains there too. The cake is kept in a cold room.

Under the base of cake you start to introduce molten chocolate (lava) under pressure. At some point the melted chocolate is going to start appearing on the surface. 

As the molten chocolate is forced under the surface two things will happen. It will melt the chocolate chips and caramel it comes in contact with and it force the biscuits base above it to break and crack introducing faults and weak points. At some point the molten chocolate will find its way to the surface through the weakest points and either start oozing out or spraying into the air. The chocolate oozed or squirted out might form a cone and/or the displaced crust might form a mountain. It all depends on the ingredients and what happens.

Imagine that there is a limited amount of chocolate to be pumped in. Once the chocolate is done the chocolate will solidify and the surface may slump down, inducing new cracks and the system will reset. The next time molten chocolate is pumped in, the weakest spot might or might not be at the same place as last time, the pump might have moved or cracks formed. It will be hard to predict exactly where.

As with real volcanoes, the following eruption is likely to in the same place as the previous time as that is the easiest place to melt through and provides the least resistance but there may be empty voids created by the expanding and slumping process that may provide a new easiest path. 

As for tectonic plates, the magma will find the weak spot where the plates are separating away from each other. If one plate is going under the other plate (subducting) this will induce the magma to be formed under pressure and will be the equivalent of the pump in the simulation.

Once a volcanic cone reaches a certain size or mountains have formed, the chance the magma will find an easier route is higher. So, it’s complicated.",comment_4,r/AskScience,Education,,https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/1kp0x2i/can_a_volcano_form_on_top_of_a_mountain_that_is/

"Forensic pathology student here! I’d be happy to help answer

It’s basically the blood cells decomposing and releasing gases— as is normal through the decomposition process. 

So basically, the bacteria that breaks down the body comes from the intestines. When we die, it begins to spread throughout the body via the blood vessels because they act like a pathway throughout the body since their purpose is to transport blood everywhere. So when the bacteria spreads, it breaks down the blood and creates gases like methane and hydrogen sulfide. 

It’s important to note that your blood contains hemoglobin, which carries iron. That iron is released and mixes with the hydrogen sulfide. It then creates a green/blue coloration that is visible through the skin. 


So, to answer your question about whether it can not be present:

Marbling is affected by a ton of environmental factors that can speed up the appearance or delay it. Things like temperature, humidity, position, time, insects, clothes, and cause of death can all affect it. 

Here’s a few examples:

Let’s say someone was locked in a freezer or died while climbing Mount Everest. Somewhere extremely cold. You may see a lack of marbling entirely depending on the temperature.

Someone was a victim of a horrendous murder and for whatever reason, the killer decided to drain their blood (see the black dahlia case for example).

"Does a Black Hole have a bottom? Watching videos on black holes got me thinking... Do black holes have a bottom?

Why this crosses my mind is because black holes grow larger as it consumes more matter. Kind of like how a drop of water becomes a puddle that becomes a lake and eventually an ocean if you keep add more water together. Another way to think of it is if you keep blowing more air into a balloon. As long as the matter inside does not continue to compact into a smaller space.

So... why would a black hole ever grow if the matter insides keeps approaching infinite density?

I would think if you put empty cans into a can crusher and let it continue to crush into a denser volume as you add more cans, it should eventually reach a maximum density where you cannot get any denser and will require a larger crusher that can hold more volume. That mass of cans should continue to grow. But if it has infinite density, no matter how much cans you put inside, the volume stays the same.

Because the ""event horizon"" isn't a physical thing.

It's just the point in its gravity well where the influence of gravity becomes so extreme that there is no longer any physical entity in our universe that can escape. The result is a defined shroud of no return.

When the Black Hole eats more mass, that point becomes heavier, and thus the object itself has more gravity. As its gravity increases, its range increases, and thus the ""event horizon"" grows.

It's also worth considering that we have absolutely no idea what's happening inside a black hole at all. Our theories that describe reality outside of that horizon don't really work beyond it.

- most experimentation in proteins makes them less effective, so the allele variants that show up in populations of all sizes are more likely to become dominant as the population is more affected by drift.

-If the population is smaller, i would imagine an individual is less likely to be rejected due to sexual preference in species where this is relevant

What is unclear to me is why a large population size is not just delaying how long it takes for a broken or less effective allele to become widespread due to drift, unless you need a larger population to counteract drift with selection pressure.
Am i missing anything?

"Say hello to Tim. Tim is a nomal guy. One random UV ray hit one of his testicle cells, producing an inheritable mutation. Tim has 4 kids: 2 have this mutation and 2 not.

Their kids all had 4 kids, too. Now you have 16 grandsons with 4 having the mutation, and 12 not. Those grandsons had 4 kids each, now you have 64 grandgrandsons, with 8 with the mutation and 56 without it. And we are at the present now, and Tim had his kids 100 years ago. 8 people with the mutation in a population of 1000 will give you a rate of 1 in 125 people with the mutation. 8 people in a population of 1000000 will give you a rate of 1 in 125000.

But, if you were mating inside Tim's ancestor line, you would have a rate of 1 in 8 instead (result of 64 / 8).

Now, this mutation produces 0 problems for Tim or his offsprings, with the mutation or not. The real problem happens when a kid inherit this mutation from both of his parents. For as how this can happen, I did a more detailed explanation here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/1kjcmhc/comment/mroh5o8/?context=3&utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web3x&utm\_name=web3xcss&utm\_term=1&utm\_content=share\_button](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/1kjcmhc/comment/mroh5o8/?context=3&utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)

As you can see, time since mutation start, reproduction rate (which is more of cultural and envioremental than genetical related), population size and relatedness, and filtering (natural selection etc), are all factors, but like any multiplication (for your final probability), all factors have an equal weighting (with the exception of filtering).

However, for the purpose of avoiding recessive genetic disease, as you need to sum the same kind of mutation twice, a good strategy to prevent the 1+1=2 is to reduce the relatedness (and this does not go for inbreeding only but for populations as whole) every so and then, to dilute a specific mutation among more people, and reduce chances of it repeating twice in both parents.",comment_1,r/AskScience,Education,,https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/1kli98b/why_does_inbreeding_lead_to_more_issues_with/
"The mutations that are affected by inbreeding are often recessive: you need two copies of the mutated allele for the negative effect to take place.

In a non inbred population, this means that the same random mutation would have had to have occurred in mom's ancestry and in dad's ancestry. This is really unlikely, so it's not a big concern.

In an inbred population, mom and dad share the same ancestors, so the chance that they both carry a copy of the same mutation gets way higher. If great grandpa had the mutation, and mom and dad had the same great grandpa, they could both easily carry the mutation. If they both have one copy, then it's possible their child inherits one mutated copy from each parent, and ends up suffering the negative effects. 

Furthermore, every single one of the child's children would then be carriers",comment_2,r/AskScience,Education,,https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/1kli98b/why_does_inbreeding_lead_to_more_issues_with/
"Most mutations are recessive because it's a lot easier to make something not work (loss-of-function mutation) than to make it work even harder. When one of your copies of a gene doesn't work, the other one can usually work hard enough to make the broken gene unnoticeable. 

Everyone has a few mutations that would be deadly if they had 2 copies of it. Normally, these random mutations are so rare that having two unrelated chromosomes means all these tiny random loss-of-function(LOF) mutations are unnoticeable. But when you start inbreeding, the kids will start having both of their copies of a gene from one person.  so the chance of having two copies of a random LOF mutation goes up because it only needs  to happen once in the ancestor to show up twice in inbred kids.",comment_3,r/AskScience,Education,,https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/1kli98b/why_does_inbreeding_lead_to_more_issues_with/
"> the allele variants that show up in populations of all sizes are more likely to become dominant as the population is more affected by drift.

Other people have already addressed the central question, so I'll focus on this part: it's important to recognize that ""dominant"" does not mean ""most common"" in genetics.

Dominant is the opposite of recessive. A dominant allele produces its associated effect even when only carried in one copy; a recessive allele must be carried in two copies to show an effect. Dominant alleles can be rare or common; recessive alleles can be rare or common. Whether an allele is recessive or dominant depends on the particulars of how that gene operates at a molecular level.

So dominance doesn't change when allele frequency changes. Also, while dominance does determine how an allele is affected by selection, it doesn't affect how an allele is affected by genetic drift.",comment_4,r/AskScience,Education,,https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/1kli98b/why_does_inbreeding_lead_to_more_issues_with/
"Excellent points, just wanted to add one more little extra bit of complexity: ""dominant"" and ""recessive"" are also not hard binary states. *Some* genes work that way, but many genes are only partially or incompletely dominant, or can be co-dominant. So, for instance, the O blood type gene is functionally fully recessive, because that's coding for an *absence* of antigens. If someone's genes are OA or OB, they'll still express A antigens or B antigens and thus be that blood type. But someone who has AB genotype will express *both* types. This means A isn't dominant over B and B isn't dominant over A; they are *co-dominant* and both will be expressed fully. That's why there are four main types: A (which can be AA or OA genotype), B (which can be BB or OB), AB (which can only be AB genotype), and O (which can only be OO genotype).

Other options can exist for other genes. As a classic example, in snapdragons, there are genes for red flowers and for white flowers (amongst other colors). If you crossbreed a pure red flower (RR) with a pure white flower (WW), all of the resulting plants will have *pink* flowers, because expressing a mixture of the two colors (RW) creates pink. Whereas a pink flower (RW) and a white flower (WW) might produce white or pink, since you cannot reach homozygous red (RR) from those parents.

Many many other possible expressions can occur, which is part of what makes genetics such a difficult science; even when you know all the parts in isolation, you may not know how they *interact*.",comment_5,r/AskScience,Education,,https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/1kli98b/why_does_inbreeding_lead_to_more_issues_with/

"Yes. There are many examples of this, particularly in the co-evolution of floral colour/pattern traits and insect sensory traits. There are often general trends in flower shape, fragrance and colour depending on target pollinators, although there are of course exceptions. An example would be flowers that are predominantly pollinated by beetles. These are often bowl shaped, and tend to be white/green, and have strong fragrances. Other flowers have patterns that cannot be seen with the human eye, but that are highly attractive to the vision of the target pollinator. These genetic traits in the flowering plant are therefore subject to selective pressure, as are those that control the organs and behaviours used to detect them in the animal, and there is much shared evolutionary history.",comment_1,r/AskScience,Education,,https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/1kldewt/are_flower_colors_selected_for_in_the/

Which again isn't the question--what does it *mean* to be green? or blue or anything else? It means some subsection of the electromagnetic spectrum, specifically in the part we call ""visible.""

Of course they are that's why we had to develop words for them, but you shouldn't limit your vision to just *our colors.* Life is much more interesting than all that, flowers have patterns that cannot be seen unless you use IR or Ultra-**Violet** Spectrums.

"The Richter scale is logarithmic which is counter-intuitive and difficult for the general public to understand. What are the benefits, why is this the way we talk about earthquake strength? I was just reading about a 9.0 quake in Japan versus an 8.2 quake in the US. The 8.2 quake is 6% as strong as 9.0. I already knew roughly this and yet was still struck by how wide of a gap 8.2 to 9.0 is.

I’m not sure if this was an initial goal but the Richter scale is now the primary way we talk about quakes — so why use it? Are there clearer and simpler alternatives? Do science communicators ever discuss how this might obfuscate public understanding of what’s being measured?",post,r/AskScience,Education,1678.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/1kkhp20/the_richter_scale_is_logarithmic_which_is/
"First a clarification, we haven't used the Richter scale for decades (**EDIT** we haven't used the Richter or other local magnitude scales for large events for decades, see comment by /u/lotsandlotstosay about the use of Richter magnitudes for smaller events). At least within the US (and much of the rest of the world), we've used the [moment magnitude](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moment_magnitude_scale) scale for moderate to large earthquakes effectively since its development in the late 1970s (e.g., [Hanks & Kanamori, 1979](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/JB084iB05p02348)). The moment magnitude scale is based directly on the [seismic moment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seismic_moment), which is a physical property of the earthquake (effectively a torque and shares the same units, i.e., N-m, or sometimes dyne-cm for the seismic moment) and is a product of the area of the fault rupture, the displacement of that rupture, and the rigidity of the material. Ultimately we can't measure seismic moment directly and we approximate it through [one of several different properties of seismic waves as measured by a seismometer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moment_magnitude_scale#Subtypes). The semi-arbitrary terms in conversion of the seismic moment to the common variants of the moment magnitude scale are designed so that the values produced are *approximately* similar to the Richter scale, mainly since it was already familiar to both the public and professionals, but the Richter scale was inherently a local scale (i.e., it was a scale only designed to work in a very specific area of the world, specifically Southern California) plus it had a variety of pretty untenable problems (e.g., it became ""saturated"" at high magnitudes, it underestimated the magnitude of deep and distant earthquakes, etc.) that really preclude it from being useful. 

In terms of more intuitive scales, log quantities are just a lot easier to deal with. I mean, we could just skip the magnitude all together and just report seismic moments directly, but I doubt that talking about the difference between an earthquake with a scalar seismic moment of 4.0271 x 10^(22) N-m (the equivalent of a Mw 9.0) vs one with a scalar seismic moment of 2.5409 x 10^(21) N-m (the equivalent of a Mw 8.2) is any more intuitive than the moment magnitude numbers. Similarly, we could skip the attempts to maintain equivalence with the old Richter scale and just do log (based 10) of the moment and make a less arbitrary magnitude scale, where we'd have a 22.605 and 21.405 ""magnitude"" earthquakes in the two examples. To my knowledge, no one has ever proposed just using the log of the seismic moment directly, however scientific discussions and papers on details of earthquakes often do mainly discuss them in terms of seismic moment and we're often considering their values on log-log or semi-log plots. The other thing to be aware of is that there are *a lot* of [different seismic magnitude scales](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seismic_magnitude_scales), including those based on different seismic waves (e.g., surface vs body waves) or those based on estimates of [radiated energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_class). All of them are logarithmic (again, because reporting large numbers is kind of a pain) and all have their own issues or embedded assumptions. 

Ultimately though, trying to explain what is physically being measured and the various embedded assumptions and conversions is going to *much more complicated* than just sticking with some version of the existing moment magnitude scale. I.e., numeric representation aside, I can attest to the fact that trying to explain to a room full of geology grad students why it makes sense to measure earthquakes in terms of torques in the context of a ['double-couple'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moment_magnitude_scale#Single_couple_or_double_couple) is challenging enough, let alone to the general public (not to even mention the assumptions underlying our estimation of seismic moment itself). Thus, I would question the logic that a scale closer to ""what is being measured"" would be any more intuitive than the one we commonly use.

**EDIT:** It's also worth considering that to the extent that there is literature to support the contention, i.e., that there are problems with public perception or understanding of seismic magnitude scales, the issues lies with the disconnect between *magnitude* and *intensity*. Magnitude scales are attempting to measure something intrinsic and physical about the earthquake regardless of where the observer is with respect to the earthquake. In contrast, [intensity scales](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seismic_intensity_scales) are categorizing the experience of an earthquake in a given location. Common intensity scales, like the [Modified Mercalli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modified_Mercalli_intensity_scale) are more qualitative, but you could certainly make quantitative scales based directly on a physical parameter like [peak ground acceleration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peak_ground_acceleration). Intensity is certainly more intuitive, but it's also extremely variable and varies spatially *a lot* for a given earthquake and between earthquakes of the same magnitude depending on local details (depth, distance, direction, etc.), and therein lies the issue. I.e., the research on the perception of earthquake magnitudes highlights that people tend to ""anchor"" on an experienced intensity related to a particular magnitude even though the intensity related to that magnitude is highly dependent on all of the local details of that earthquake (e.g., [Celsi et al., 2005](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1193/1.2099047)). Put another way, you experience a Mw 7.0 earthquake in a location where the intensity was relatively mild and there's a decent chance that you will perceive the risk of another Mw 7.0 earthquake to be minimal, even though another Mw 7.0 with different local details could be *extremely dangerous to you in that same location*. That's a much bigger issue in terms of public communication related to earthquakes and is totally independent of the exact way we report earthquake magnitudes.",comment_1,r/AskScience,Education,,https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/1kkhp20/the_richter_scale_is_logarithmic_which_is/

"/u/CrustalTrudger gave an amazing answer that I really enjoyed reading. But I think to address your question from a different angle, log scales are used in general because numbers quickly become just as hard to comprehend and get harder to write out when you put too many zeroes after them. It's just not easy to intuit the difference between 8,200,000,000 and 82,000,000,000 at a glance. So, in every field where something is being measured that spans tens of logs on the raw number, the base ten logarithm is used to simplify the communication of numbers: spore counts for bacterial cells, pH of acids/bases, thermal and electrical conductivity/resistivity, etc. 

ETA: To expand on this just a little more - when you're directly collecting data that is logarithmic (or if you're regularly digesting it) it becomes immediately obvious that only the exponent matters. If someone gives you the following list: 5.125 x 10^8, 2.624 x 10^12, and 8.258 x 10^20 then you're going to be asking yourself why did you even bother reading any number besides 10^x . So why not just write it as 8 log, 12 log, and 20 log directly? Or to capture the data even more precisely, calculate the actual logarithm... and we've come full circle to Richter and all the others.  

I do get what you're saying that this does present an issue in science communication. But practically all numbers are meaningless without units, and this is no exception. Also, at the end of the day, the primary reason for these scales to exist is to communicate between scientists.

"When logs are used in science, there is almost always an exponential cause behind it. This isn’t just “too many zeroes,” but “it felt linear.” Sound is measured in decibels because our hearing is (oh so very roughly… go look at an actual plot and it’s not even monotonic at all frequencies) logarithmic if you plot a few points and try to curve fit. 

The Richter scale was similarly made by measuring the “apparent shaking” at various distances from the epicenter. It just happened to pretty reasonably fit a log scale.

pH is only kinda this way, as a chemist working for a brewery was trying to set acceptable acidity in beer. He figured out the exponential, but then made the scale to make it easier to label acceptable ranges. So the linearization is useful in food science, but that’s just because

"There have been lots of studies of closed communities with high levels of cousin marriage in the UK (for example in Bradford) which have found significant increases in the risk of various health conditions. There's a decent summary of a recent study in [this BBC article](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c241pn09qqjo) for example, which showed increases in general ill-health (as indicated by trips to a primary care doctor), as well as educational consequences.",comment_1,r/AskScience,Education,,https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/1kjcmhc/what_do_population_studies_say_about_genetic_risk/
"Over enough generations of close interbreeding, deleterious recessive alleles will accumulate and lead to non-viable offspring. This can happen at varying rates, but generally 1 or 2 generations doesn’t result in non-viable offspring. Just look at the royal family. Even though they have their own host of genetic health issues, probably caused by interbreeding, they continued having children and producing heirs. We don’t have a large study of a population of close interbreeding over many generations, but there is evidence some populations are more interbred than others due to cultural norms of cousin marriages.",comment_2,r/AskScience,Education,,https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/1kjcmhc/what_do_population_studies_say_about_genetic_risk/
"A compounding factor with royal interbreeding is that people were often married based on position and alliances.

"It should be noted that the Bradford study ultimately found that the participants had the normal cousin marriage defect rate of 6% (vs 3% baseline). So in terms of at least that closed community, the extra risk of what we assume to be repeated cousin marriages is no different from the risk of a single cousin marriage. 

Most likely, merely having a culture of cousin marriages is insufficient to cause genetic issues in excess of what is normally expected of cousin marriages; you would probably need a more tightly controlled program of inbreeding to have much effect.

"When it comes to cousin marriages, especially first cousins, population studies have looked into this a lot. If two people are first cousins, it means they share about 12.5% of their DNA. Not a huge amount, but definitely more than random strangers. When first cousins marry once, the risk of having a child with a serious genetic disorder goes up a little. But now if cousin marriages keep happening generation after generation, repeated cousin marriages in the same family, that’s when things start to stack up a bit. Geneticists call it inbreeding depression The chances of recessive genetic conditions showing up become higher, just because there's a smaller gene pool. More shared DNA, more chances for those hidden mutations to meet up and cause trouble.",comment_5,r/AskScience,Education,,https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/1kjcmhc/what_do_population_studies_say_about_genetic_risk/

"Disposable equipment is incinerated to avoid potential contamination of the dump site or any reuse.

Prion proteins don't denature under the usual autoclaving procedure so that's why we use these enhanced procedures.

"Prions aren't tissues, human or otherwise.  Prions are misfolded proteins, and they are incredibly hard to destroy.  The diseases they cause are incurable, and it takes very little infectious material to lead to disease.  Oh sure, it'll take a few years or possibly even decades from exposure to develop a disease, but it still can't be stopped.

See, the big problem is that prions aren't alive, so the usual methods that would result in pathogens like viral particles or bacteria being rendered inert don't work.  A dead bacterium can't reproduce, no matter where it ends up.  Destroy a virus' sheath and its RNA denatures easily.  But a prion won't denature in bleach or alcohol.  It can't be killed because it was never alive.  Time won't even touch it, at least not any span of time that's reasonable to keep medical equipment stored for later use.  Heat will destroy it, sure, but they can take surprisingly high temperatures, and will usually destroy the contaminated equipment anyway.

Comparing proteins to mechanical equipment is... actually reasonably apt.  Proteins serve a bunch of different functions in the body, and are tailor-made for those purposes.

Group A was given a story to read in a print book,
Group B was given that same story but they made the book more “informative” with hyperlinks on certain words, sources for certain pieces of information with their own hyperlinks, etc. 

They found that when it came to retelling the story, that although there were more resources in group B to help the subjects understand certain words and contexts, they could hardly recall what they read, while group A was fine.

“Also, obesity and increased long-term stress has also been reported to co-occur in dogs and owners. Other non-communicable diseases such as diabetes and cancers are increasingly common both in dogs and humans. Interestingly, captive primates develop cardiovascular disorders in high rates for which environmental as well as diet related reasons have been suspected.

"It can, if the two illnesses are caused by substantially similar bacteria or viruses with similar sites that antigens can bind to and attack.  This is why, for example, cowpox works as an immunization against smallpox -- the shell of the virus is pretty similar.  It's also similar to the reason that antibiotics can work on a range of bacteria but not others -- they attack specific intracellular processes that some organisms use, but not all do.

If they incorrectly guess the dominant strains for the next year, there is usually a bit of cross-reactivity.  This explains statements like “the flu vaccine is 50% effective this year”.

"So your immune system recognizes foreign invaders through little bits and chunks. The main pieces responsible for recognition are the T and B cell receptors and antibodies, which are essentially a version of the B cell receptors that are secreted (i.e. free in solution, not stuck to a cell). What makes these recognition machines special is their ability to rapidly mutate the antigen binding region of the receptor in order to adapt to work on newly encountered threats. 

This results in highly specific receptors, which usually target bits of foreign proteins or other pieces of an invader. The chunks they recognize are quite small though, and this is how invaders can adapt to evade recognition. If your body develops an antibody to recognize a small chunk of a single type of protein (the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 for example), a mutant virus with a modified spike protein will likely not stick well to the antibody and thus the antibody won't work well. In turn we have developed strategies for countering this (for example we choose proteins like said spike protein that are unlikely to rapidly evolve for biology reasons).

To get to the root of your question, it depends. For the same antibody to work on two organisms that antibody must bind to a surface that is essentially identical between the two invaders, something that is pretty unlikely to happen. This is doubly unlikely when you consider that there is a strong evolutionary pressure for invaders to evade our antibodies, something easily accomplished by mutation of whatever antigen said antibodies recognized. 

TLDR - technically possibly, usually unlikely due to the highly specific nature of antibodies and the high selection pressure for invaders to evade said antibodies.


For an extra bit of fun, as a supplement to the specific and adaptive parts of our immune system (antibodies, TCRs, etc) we also have a bunch of innate immune system functions which target more generic signs of infection. They give up the ability to specifically recognize 1 thing really really well (like a spike protein of a virus) for the broad ability to recognize generic infection (i.e. debris from dying cells, chunks of bacteria). These mechanisms *do* work against large swaths of different invaders, they just don't use antibodies to do so. We call this part of the immune system ""innate"" immunity vs the ""adaptive"" immunity provided by antibodies, TCRs, etc.",comment_5,r/AskScience,Education,,https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/1kj2rnl/would_human_antibodies_be_interchangeable_if_a/
How are pathogens denatured without their antigens changing when making vaccines? I have a gcse level understanding of biology so please keep it simple.,post,r/AskScience,Education,82.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/1kird80/how_are_pathogens_denatured_without_their/
"What you're likely talking about is inactivated vaccines, where the pathogen is treated such that it is no longer active and cannot replicate in the host. In this case, the ""dead"" pathogens get taken up by antigen presenting cells and the proteins present get chopped up into peptide fragments. These fragments are then loaded into the antigen presentation machinery and get displayed on the cell surface by MHC. Note that the process of inactivation needs to be balanced such that it robustly inactivates the pathogen without substantially affecting antigenic structure.

Formaldehyde and beta-propiolactone (BPL) are the most commonly used approaches to inactivate pathogens  in vaccine production. BPL acts by disrupting DNA and RNA at the structural level, such that it can no longer be replicated (either by host or pathogen replication machinery). Since BPL primarily affects DNA/RNA (which aren't presented by MHC), it is unlikely that BPL will negatively affect antigen presentation.

Formaldehyde on the other hand directly affects proteins present in the pathogen. It modifies individual amino acids in the protein in a process called cross-linking. This will greatly hinder the function of proteins (particularly those with enzymatic roles), yielding an inactivated pathogen. While these modifications affect the structure/folding of the protein, it wont cause complete denaturation. Formaldehyde primarily modifies lysine and arginine residues in a protein, so in some cases this can affect antigen processing/presentation but usually the protein sequence is large/diverse enough that it can still get cleaved into peptides for display on MHC. Remember that a single protein antigen can have many epitopes (places where antibodies can bind). While some potential epitopes may be lost by formaldehyde-treatment usually the response following vaccination is sufficient enough that it is still protective. Also, antibodies don't always need a perfect antigenic match to bind, the 'match' just determines the strength of the bond.",comment_1,r/AskScience,Education,,https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/1kird80/how_are_pathogens_denatured_without_their/
"Firstly, ""denatured"" refers to proteins, not the entire pathogen. Proteins are long chains of amino acids  folded into complex 3D structures. Denaturing a protein changes it to its linear form (typically using heat). The immune system recognizes ""epitopes,"" or short sequences of amino acids. If amino acids 55-65 for a 100 amino acid protein are an epitope recognized by the immune system and are all exposed on the outer surface of the protein when folded, then denaturing the protein won't affect recognition by the immune system.",comment_2,r/AskScience,Education,,https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/1kird80/how_are_pathogens_denatured_without_their/
"Even your immune system does not necessarily make antibodies that recognize the entire protein antigen.  Immune cells will copy and make multiple types of antibodies that recognize different segments of the amino acid chain that make up the protein.

A protein may be hundreds, thousands, or tens of thousands of amino acids long, but they often repeat. So, it may take knowing only forty, or eighty- two, or a hundred amino acids in the chain to recognize that protein. 

Denaturing uncoils or unfolds the protein, and while the heat or whatever agent, may even break the chains into smaller segments, the segments are long enough to recognize.

I'm already a little fuzzy on certain details, but I remember one of the emerging COVID variants having something like twelve or sixteen important new mutations modifying it's spike protein, which was enough to worry people that it would evade the vaccines. But in reality, it only made the current vaccine a very small percentage less effective. In other words, (and these are very made-up numbers, just for illustration) if you had gotten the first two shots, or already survived an infection, then your body had made 10 or 12 effective types of antibodies that would latch on segments of the spike protein. Despite the new mutations, 9-11, or even more, still worked because their segment of the chain hadnt been changed.

"> the ""dead"" pathogens get taken up by antigen presenting cells and the proteins present get chopped up into peptide fragments. These fragments are then loaded into the antigen presentation machinery and get displayed on the cell surface by MHC. 

This describes one half of the adaptive immune system. The other half doesn't rely on chopping up proteins - and can recognize antigens that are not protein, or only partially protein. For example, particular sugar units on cell surface proteins.

Inactivation of a pathogen still leaves plenty of antigens intact enough for that part of the system to be activated as well.",comment_4,r/AskScience,Education,,https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/1kird80/how_are_pathogens_denatured_without_their/
"To expand on this, the reason why only small portions of a protein are needed to trigger an immune reaction is not because proteins are repetitive - a lot of them aren't. While in theory, an immune reaction can develop against any stretch  of amino acids, a lot of them aren't immunigenic, i.e. aren't good at stimulating a strong immune response. This can be e.g. due to resembling an amino acid stretch that your own body makes. Your immuen system will ideally not react against that because it would trigger an autoimmune reaction. This can actually be a mechanism of immune escape for some viruses and bacteria! If they look too similar to ourselves, the immune system cannot target them.",comment_5,r/AskScience,Education,,https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/1kird80/how_are_pathogens_denatured_without_their/

Good news!  You’re not going to die by electrocution.  You’ll be melted to death instead!,comment_3,r/AskScience,Education,,https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/1khrsm7/would_a_full_body_set_of_chainmail_armor_protect/
"You'll sometimes see folks in videos [like this](https://youtu.be/QqEesFaboV4?t=34) interacting with tesla coils wearing what look like chainmail suits and shrugging off what appears to be rather dramatic electrical arcs. Impressive stuff, and it works! The 'faraday suit', which completely encloses the body, acts as a low impedance path to ground, redirecting the current from passing through fleshy bits and through and out the suit itself, keeping the wearer perfectly safe. 

Should work with lightning too then, no? Ah, well... 

To get these impressive arcs of 'lightning', tesla coils use high-frequency AC, which tends to travel over surfaces and can ionise the air pretty well. With such a short, rapid current pulse over the surface area of a person in the suit, only a fractional amount of the energy would ever try to pass through to the ground. The current is low, even if the voltage is high.

A genuine lightning strike by contrast is a veritable medley of AC/DC (though mostly a high-current pulse of DC), involving enormous currents and voltages over a very short time frame; many, many orders of magnitude more powerful than tesla coils. It's 1-10+ billion joules of near instantaneous energy delivery, compared to the coils measly handful - like comparing a sparkler with being hit by a freight train. The scale of powers isn't even close.

Even though most of the several billion joules of energy is spent ionising miles of air and grounding, with only a small fraction passing through the suit, with a moderate lightning strike that's still 10 million joules - enough to take all paths near simultaneously including through you. Given the sheer *power* involved, even if most is redirected, that's still a hefty current passing through you directly. Further, upon contact with the, say, steel mesh atop your head, the resistance of the metal will cause it to heat up - with a specific heat capacity of  ~500 J/kg °C, you're talking 800°C or more assuming solid steel, but it being chainmail would mean there's higher resistance, so more joule heating, and higher temperatures - 1,500+ °C at the contact point which is getting into melting territory. 

Thermodynamics further complicates things - everything happens *so fast* - perhaps there's not enough time for heat to accumulate before the energy is distributed into the ground? I don't know. With such small contact points between links, it feels like the chainmail should heat up more than sufficiently to cause *severe* burns and, you being trapped inside the suit (having arc welded the links together with you still inside), keep burning you - as opposed to just going without.

Most people do survive being struck by lightning after all, as long as it doesn't pass through your brain nor heart - perhaps it'd be preferable to just be naked given the option. I otherwise think all the metal exacerbates the ordeal; there'd just be a bubbling, half-molten hole where your face once was, and a lingering smell of barbeque in the air.

Maybe plate armour would be marginally better; it wouldn't heat up as dramatically, but there's also the pressure wave to deal with, and having all your soft watery bits in such an enclosed space... Grenades kill not through shrapnel, but by shockwaves, 'innit.",comment_4,r/AskScience,Education,,https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/1khrsm7/would_a_full_body_set_of_chainmail_armor_protect/

"ELI5: I don’t understand what Jordan Belfort was selling in the wolf of Wall Street? Why was it illegal? Like he seems to sell bad stocks to people who are idiots but why was the FBI involved?

"Selling stocks isn't a crime, they were inflating the value of stocks through false statements, not selling when they should be and price gouging. 


Everything they did was bullshit with the aim of ripping off their customers to make money. 


Whenever securities are involved you are supposed to act honestly and with transparency which they weren't. 


At the time the market was quite grey and consumer protection probably isn't what it should have been so they thought they could get away with it.


It's one of the reasons why Crypto is now being used to do similar sorts of things because it's a new market and there's no regulations in place yet, so influencers are being used to pump coins to people and then dump them when they've made money and there's no laws in place to stop them.",comment_1,r/explainlikeimfive,Education,,https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/1ku628l/eli5_i_dont_understand_what_jordan_belfort_was/
"Basically what they were doing were pump-and-dump schemes using so-called 'penny stocks'. These stocks have a very low share value because they're attached to businesses that have a completely dubious financial future. What Belfort's company would do, however, is buy a large amount of these cheap stocks, then call inexperienced investors and try to convince them that these companies are actually the next Google or whatever. ""You're getting in on the ground floor of a company that is about to take over the world,"" using manipulated information or outright lies to convince them. Getting enough investors to buy into the dubious stock would artificially inflate the value. That's the ""pump"". But Belfort's company still held the majority of the dubious stock, so at an arbitrary time they would then sell all of it at once, making a lot of money in the process and also completely screwing over everyone that had invested following their advice. That's the ""dump"".

This is illegal under regulatory rules as a form of securities fraud. You can't tell people false or misleading information to convince them to invest in a stock, for one thing, and for another, if you have massive holdings in the stock that you're selling - and stand to gain financially if the people you're convincing to buy do so - you're supposed to disclose that.

If you're thinking, well wait a minute, doesn't this exact thing happen all the time in the cypto space and people just get away with it, including literally the President of the United States recently?

"It’s called ballast.

The compacted gravel provides a good bearing layer for the sleepers that won’t settle or shift, while being porous so water just drains through rather than collect, which also helps prevent issues due to ice. The large voids also limit how quickly dust and dirt will accumulate, and weeds won’t readily grow in the gravel, so cuts down on maintenance.

The stones also spread the load from the tracks across a fairly wide width, and absorb some of the shock from the sudden loading, so you don’t get settlement of the underlying earth layers due to loads from the train wheels.

"""uncured"" ham just means instead of curing it with nitrates, they cure it with celery powder (which contains nitrates). It's about as meaningful as ""all-natural"" on a label.


There have been studies linking nitrates to cancer, but they tested far larger amounts than any normal human would consume from eating ham and there's no particular data stating that the nitrates found in celery powder are any better for you.

"They're still cured. Meats are cured by using nitrate salts in addition to normal table salt. These nitrate salts have antimicrobial properties which stop the growth of bacteria like botulinum, which table salt alone does not. In addition, meat that is only salted will turn a fairly unpleasant grey color (this isn't harmful, but people expect bacon to be pink).

These salts are primarily found as mineral deposits. However, certain plants, specifically celery, are naturally high in nitrate salts.

There is some evidence that eating foods high in nitrates, especially if they're cooked over high heat, can be bad for you. This evidence has hit the media, which has lead to people avoiding cured meats.

Companies who made cured meats wanted to keep selling their products to people who were avoiding nitrate salts, but didn't want their products to turn grey.

Unfortunately, the FDA has allowed companies to claim that their products are ""uncured"" if they avoid using nitrate salts from mineral sources, even if they use large amounts of celery juice or celery salt to provide the same level of nitrate salts in the food.

So, the next time you see packaging claiming something is ""uncured,"" look at the ingredients list; if it lists celery on it (usually as celery salt or celery juice) it's cured just like the regular stuff.",comment_2,r/explainlikeimfive,Education,,https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/1kup4nq/eli5_as_a_kid_all_meats_were_cured_today_i_notice/
"Cured meats were thought to cause various cancers so they tried to market similar products (bacon, ham, sausage, etc) as being ""safer"".

The cynic in me thinks this is pure marketing, like putting ""fat free"" on candy that is pure sugar. A lot of times the alternative methods of preservation aren't really any healthier than what they did before. For instance, sodium nitrate was a popular curing agent since it helped maintain a nice pink color to meats. You'll see products marketed as ""contains no artificial nitrates"" but they just use celery salt, which apparently naturally contains nitrates. I find I dubious that this is safer than the alternative.

Remember that the last thing these companies want is for people to simply *consume less* unhealthy foods, so they'll just market existing foods to convince consumers that the product is now *safer* than it once was.

Nitrites are the only way to 100% prevent botulism  to develop in cured meat as they age. 

Botulism is produced by bacteria’s in meat under  some conditions, and is very bad, it’s THE most toxic thing to humans. So a lot of food agencies requires nitrites if you cure meats.

Meat producers saw this as a way to save on cost by simply injecting meats with artificial flavours without nitrites and just not curing the meat. It’s faster and cheaper as curing can take weeks or even years.

"> A future superintelligent AI will punish those who heard about it but didn't help it come into existence. So by reading it, you are in danger of such punishment

Keep in mind it's actually a more specific claim than that.

A future ""evil"" AI wouldn't just punish you because you ""didn't help it come into existence"" because it literally wouldn't care - it's in existence now, so it'll have its own goals, and have no specific reason to care about who help it come into existence. Maybe it immediately kills everyone who helped create it, because it correctly deduces that they're its biggest threat - the people most likely to be able to turn the AI off.

...

So, evil AI in general has no reason to care. The thing about the Basilisk is you're meant to go ""oops well I heard about the Basilisk so I better build the basilisk myself and program it to punish people, because if someone else built basilisk instead of me and programmed it to punish people, then *that* basilisk would punish me"". So the people who make this would have to very specifically program it to be obsessed with that, for it to happen.

Now that I mentioned it, you should logically also work towards creating Trombasilisk too, and take up the trombone.

"Its only scary if you buy into a very specific kind of transhumanism.

The community where it originated, LessWrong, believed several impossible things:

1. AI superintelligence is not only possible, but given the current state of computer science (as of the 00s), inevitable.
2. An AI superintelligence will be, functionally, omnipotent: it will be able to supercede it's own programming, access any computerised system, effortlessly manipulate any human.
3. As such, the question of ""AI Alignment"" - ensuring the hypothetical AI God is friendly to humans - is a real and pressing if not existential concern

(As a corollary it is imperative that you donate large sums of money to Elizer Yudkowsky's nonprofit, MIRI. MIRI never actually produced any actionable AI research)

4. In the best case, a friendly AI will be able to create a digital copy of your mind and let you live in endless digital luxury. What's that? You died? Don't worry it can recreate your digital replica from your Internet browser history. 

4a. Because this replica will be identical to you it *is* you and you owe it the same moral duty of care you owe to yourself

Oh, and some other beliefs around game theory, that we're not getting into.

Now. What if, this Roko guy asks, this future AI robot God knows that - in order to hasten its creation - it needs to incentivise people to have created it. 

As such, it would obviously pre-commit (we don't have time to explain that) to torturing the digital replicas of anyone it seems to have been insufficiently committed to ~~SparkleMotion~~ creating itself.

So, if you don't donate your life savings to Elizer Yudkowsky and devote your career to AI research (which in the 00s was ""writing capsule DnD adventures"") then you are definitely for real going to Robot Hell.

Now: all of this is deeply silly and relies on someone's understanding of the world to be rooted in 1970s sci fi novels, which, well, that's who the LessWrong forum was designed to attract.

"There are not only 60 seconds in a minute, but also 360 degrees in a circle, which has the same origin.

Old Babylonians used a base 60 (sexagesimal) numerical system, with 60 different digits (although each digit was composed of a positional combination of two base symbols). They have inherited the system. Number 60 is highly divisible: by 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 12, 15, 20, 30, thus fractions are simple. 1 in 60 is also a small enough division for many purposes.

According to the old Egyptians, there are 12 hours in a day (due to 12 astronomical constellations), and the night was later also divided into 12 parts. In the Middle Ages, the hour was then divided into 60 minutes and the minute into 60 seconds, inspired by Babylonian astronomy.",comment_1,r/explainlikeimfive,Education,,https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/1ku97ic/eli5_why_is_there_60_seconds_in_a_minute/

It could have been any number, but they liked multiples of twelves, and we've stuck with that ever since.",comment_2,r/explainlikeimfive,Education,,https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/1ku97ic/eli5_why_is_there_60_seconds_in_a_minute/
"Lots of interesting questions. I try to keep it short otherwise nobody reads it. :)      

Time keeping has 2 kinds of ""magic"" numbers, 12 and 60. These are both remembrances of antic cultures. Babylonian culture used base-60 number system and they also happened to be very good at astrology. European culture inherited the base-60 part of our timekeeping from there, but also that's why we have 360 degrees in a circle (6x60).      

Egyptian and Greek cultures loved the number 12, it was considered a ""sacred"" number. You can see 12 throughout ancient cultures, think of the 12 apostles, 12 music notes, etc. 13 is the bad number since ancient times because it breaks everything that's cool about 12.       
Both of these cultures divided day and night each into 12 parts. They also divided the sky into 12 parts that's why we have 12 months (a month for each sky bit).       

Greeks united the base-60 system with base-12, that's why we have 60 minutes in an hour.     

The name hour comes from the ancient Roman ora which derived from a more ancient Greek word meaning year but as well season. So basically the idea of an ora can be followed as if 'ora' is s season of a year, then 'ora' could as well be the season of a day, because both are 1/12 parts.       

Minute means ""small"" in Latin. It came into use as a time measure with mechanic clocks which coincides with the industrial revolution. (Before that, keeping track of minutes were anyways unnecessary.) The idea is that when clocks came into use, the 1/60 part of an hour was called ""pars minuta prima"", meaning ""the first small part"". So you chop the hour once into 60s, it's the first little thing. If you further chop the already chopped thing, that's the second little thing (the little part of the little thing). In Latin, ""pars minuta seconda"".      

So you see, we could call them prima and seconda, but people are not logical when they abbreviate. From the first sentence (pars minuta prima) we kept minutes, and from the second sentence we kept seconds.

Think of it like filling a water tank from the bottom.  At first you’re only displacing air, so it’s easy to push water into the tank.  As the tank fills, you’re also displacing the water already in the tank, and it’s pushing down against the incoming water because of gravity.

"Here is the answer I once gave for a similar question about lithium ion batteries, asking why battery chargers switch from applying a constant current (CC) to applying a constant voltage (CV) when the battery is near full and slow down the charging process.


>When the battery is charging, Lithium is moving inside the cell from the cathode to the anode. The more current you are putting through it, the faster the lithium ions move to the anode.


>If too many lithium ions move over in a span of time and cannot settle into their new home, they will turn into lithium metal and stay put forever.


>When the battery is mostly empty, there is tons of room on the anode for Li ions. They can head over and find a vacancy anywhere they look. There is no hindrance to charging and you can go at the max rated current for the battery. This is CC charging. The constant current is the battery's rated current.


>After the battery gets about 80% full, it gets harder for Li ions to find a vacancy on the anode. If you kept them coming at max speed they would bottleneck trying to find a place to settle in. And some of them would metalize, forever removing them and whatever part of the anode they're covering from ever being used again.


>So you need to slow down the current based on how full the battery is. The fewer vacancies are left, the slower you have to go. This is the CV charging. By maintaining a constant voltage, the current reduces based on how full the battery is.",comment_3,r/explainlikeimfive,Education,,https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/1kubs8b/eli5_how_do_rechargeable_electronics_charge_70_in/
"Lithium-ion batteries, like most battery chemistries, take a charge best when they're in the mid-range of their charge. If they're very low on charge, or very close to full, it becomes harder to cause the chemical reactions that make the battery work.

"zip and rar files are both known as archives, and their most basic function is to take one or more files and encapsulate them in a single file. This means that if you have a bunch of files, they can put them all together in a single file until you unzip or unrar them. Both formats support an additional feature called compression. Compression takes big files and makes them into smaller files by looking for blocks of data that would be repetitive and assigning them a symbol. For example, if you had a book about cats, you could take every instance of the word ""cat"" and replace it with a ""#"" and every instance of the word kitten and replace it with a ""$"" and every instance of the word fur and replace it with a ""@"" and so on and so forth, and then just put a reference at the front of the book so that when you rewrite the book, you can put the correct words in.

EXCEPT zip and rar use some sophisticated computer math to make that type of compression work, which is called an algorithm. The difference being that zip is considerably older than rar and doesn't support more sophisticated algorithms, so it doesn't compress as well, but it still does quite well enough. Rar also supports breaking compressed files into chunks for easier transmission across the internet. But both are just different standards. You can even zip a rar file and vice versa, although the file might get bigger instead of smaller.",comment_1,r/explainlikeimfive,Education,,https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/1ku1lpj/eli5_whats_tte_difference_between_zip_and_rar/
"Many compression algorithms exist, taking data and converting it into something much smaller (hopefully). A classic one is known by the name ""Deflate"", and is the algorithm used by ZIP. A ZIP file is built by running the ""Deflate"" algorithm on each file with it, and ending the file with an index listing the files, their names, compressed and real sizes, etc. You can easily read the index to get the listing and extract files by un-compressing them. Thus a ZIP file can carry many smaller files as a single file and be smaller than the originals.

RAR is much the same concept, but a different algorithm. It's better than Deflate is, but was famously only available through the WinRAR application, and other apps made by the same company. All other things being the same, a RAR file with the same contents as a ZIP should be a bit smaller. It also had a few obscure features such as being able to output to many different files and have them combine to act like a single bigger RAR file, popular for when file hosting had size limits you could work around it by saving multiple smaller files using this RAR feature.

How a compression algorithm works varies a little bit, but largely they scan a file looking for common byte repetition patterns and replacing them with a kind of short-hand. For example, a simple text document will quickly find common works and many of them will be written as maybe 2 special bytes in the compressed version. Since most words are more than 2 bytes long, the compressed version is smaller. Then you just need a program to reverse that to get the original document back. This doesn't always work, and files with no common patterns can result in the ""compressed"" version being bigger... normally the software aborts compression and just saves the file into the ZIP straight up. But that's somewhat rare unless using something already compressed, like another ZIP but also MP3 music.

Better formats exist today, but ZIP has endured.",comment_2,r/explainlikeimfive,Education,,https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/1ku1lpj/eli5_whats_tte_difference_between_zip_and_rar/

"General idea of compression is simple from high level - you find a repeating sequence of bytes and write it in some way that takes less space. For example, when software sees ""abcabcabcabc"" it can write it to disk as ""abc""*4, which takes about 50% of space than original. Then when you ""extract"" the archive, it reconstructs the original from those instructions. 


Now, there are many various compression algorithms. Some are faster, some slower, some give higher compression ratio, some lower. Usually they are incompatible. For example given text ""abcabcXXabcabcabc"" I can either do ""abc""*2XX""abc""*3, or I can do ""z=abc;zzXXzz"", but I can not apply one on top of the other effectively.


Difference between zip and rar (and many others), is in what algorithms they use.

"Actually got into a reddit argument about this, apparently I am wrong but I will still offer it and let the downvotes come

  
So teflon (PTFE) is inert (doesn't react with things) and this is why it's so good at being non-stick. Because it doesn't react it is technically safe to eat as your body will pass it in time. The confusion stems from things called PFAS, most notably C8, these chemicals are used to make teflon. These PFAS can build up in the body and can be harmful with as little as 15-20 parts per BILLION. 

Teflon isn't perfectly safe; it can break down with high heats causing mild affects that pass quickly but can it can kill birds

The old pans not only were bad if they were scratched, but they were also bad if you got them over 350 degrees (don't remember if it was F or C though) as the Teflon would aerosolize at those temps.


If you don't know if it's an old or new version of the pan, it's probably best to err on the side of caution.

"Water (which is the base of most liquids) sticks to things. It sticks to the cup you’re pouring it out of, and it sticks to itself. If you try to pour it out, it wants to stick to the edge, and slightly over the edge, and the water going over that wants to stick to that water. That causes it to bend around the edge and cling to stuff before gravity wins the arms race, and then it falls in a dribble and not where you intended. 

You can counteract this by just pouring it very quickly, it won’t have time to stick to the edge, and the weight of the liquid falling out overcomes the stickiness.

This stickiness is called surface tension.",comment_2,r/explainlikeimfive,Education,,https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/1ku2t28/eli5_why_is_it_so_easy_to_spill_liquid_when/

"When you say you have music playing in the background, do you mean that it's playing on your phone or on a different device? Because it seems to me that a lot of these responses assume you're talking about YouTube music playing on a different device. That's why at least a couple of people are talking about how machine learning enables this. If the music's playing on your own phone, it's considerably simpler in concept. Your phone knows the exactly what it's outputting in terms of sound. It can remove that signal from its microphone input. 

And because it knows the exact waveform it needs to subtract, it doesn't require sophisticated machine learning or anything to do that. The naive way to do it would be to simply subtract the speaker signal from the microphone signal at the same time. But that won't quite work because it does take some time for the sound to travel from the phone speaker to the phone microphone. So one additional layer is to just do the math on how fast sound travels and how far apart they are, and shift the subtraction. Instead of subtracting the speaker output from the microphone input at the same time, you wait about 300 microseconds or whatever is appropriate for your phone and subtract the speaker signal from 300 microseconds ago from the microphone signal. (300 microseconds is how long it takes sound to travel 10 cm / 4 inches, so the offset would probably be 300 microseconds or less).

Of course even that isn't perfect, because sound doesn't just travel directly from speaker to microphone. It also reverberates off of your surroundings. So if you really wanted to be good at subtracting the speaker output from the microphone input, you would actually do a bunch of tests where the phone is in different physical environments, like a small room and a big room and outdoors and right next to your head and sitting on a table and so on. So then you can figure out what a particular frequency does when emitted from the speaker and returning to the microphone under all those different conditions. The thing is that the various frequencies will all be affected in different ways by the different operating conditions. You can't just use the same adjustment for every frequency. So you would have different responses to the different operating conditions and you would have to do the math on the output signal to adjust it and then subtract it from the microphone input. 

That might sound complicated, and it kind of is, but it's not as complicated as you might expect. Remember, the phone knows exactly what it's putting out through the speaker. And because the way the frequencies are affected by the environment is different between one environment and another, the phone just has to listen for a brief amount of time to figure out which kind of adjustment it should apply.

And all of this can be done through a combination of a small number of experiments and the fundamental equations. You don't actually need what people think of when they say machine learning these days. 

You can just do a test with a given phone in a few backgrounds",comment_2,r/explainlikeimfive,Education,,https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/1kufifv/eli5_how_do_phones_block_out_certain_sounds/

ELI5: what is the difference between intellectual property and copyright,post,r/explainlikeimfive,Education,6.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/1kuix5v/eli5_what_is_the_difference_between_intellectual/
"Copyright is a type of intellectual property. 

There are (basically, but this *is* ELI5) three types of intellectual property. 

* **Copyright** protects original works of authorship, including songs, music, artwork, film, writing, software, etc. and is automatically a right of the author (or the corporation that hires the author if the work is done for-hire). Copyright lasts the life of the author plus + 70 years (or 95 years from date of publication in the case of work-for-hire). The character, artwork, and stories of Iron Man comics are copyrighted by Marvel Comics.

* **Trademarks** cover words, phrases, or symbols/logos used to represent a product, service, or business. There are two types of trademarks, registered (®) and unregistered (™) that offer different levels of protection. Trademarks can last as long as the company continues to use them. Companies that operate in different industries can have similar trademarks as long as they are not easily confused. E.g., the Marvel ""Iron Man"" name and logo is a registered trademark of Marvel, but the ""Ironman"" name and logo is also a trademark of the organization that manages the Ironman Triathalons. Both can have that trademark because no on confuses one product (a comic book) with the other (a triathalon). 

* **Patents** cover original inventions. Obtaining a patent involves a lengthy application and review process, usually involving patent attorneys. Patents are only granted for 20 years. E.g. the Nintendo Switch is patented. If Tony Stark were real, Stark Industries would have applied for a patent on the Iron Man armor designs. In the real world, a manufacturer like Dyson has a patent on its vacuum cleaners or a pharmaceutical company like Pfizer has a patent on a new drug.

Edit, before someone jumps down my throat for not being expansive in my definition of IP: there *are* several other types of intellectual property as well, things like **trade secrets** (stuff that can't be copyrighted, but a company wants to keep secret -- like the recipe for Coca-cola) or **trade dress** (which is an extension of trademark that includes the ""look and feel"" of a product -- like the curly script and red can of Coca-cola), and other things . . . but the Big Three are copyright, trademarks, and patents.

"ELI5: Why does it feel like sleep resets the brain of negative emotions? Whether it's a nap or a good night's rest. Have you ever went to sleep angry, sad, or anxious and woken up fresh and free of those emotions?",post,r/explainlikeimfive,Education,699.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/1ktlqol/eli5_why_does_it_feel_like_sleep_resets_the_brain/
"A few reasons, 

Cortisol is your main stress hormone. When you wake, your cortisol level spikes and continues to deflate in production throughout the day. During deep sleep, cortisol production drops significantly and is at its lowest levels. So, during the day, it builds up like pressure in a steam kettle. Sleep releases the pressure valve, bringing cortisol levels back down to normal. 

Your brain also has a cleaning system called the glymphatic system that cleans up cellular waste products, things like misfolded proteins, metabolic byproducts, and other ""molecular garbage"" that brain cells produce just from doing their normal work. During deep sleep, it flushes out toxic waste that build through the day and contribute to your negative mood.

During REM, your brain also has the chance to review emotional experiences. This helps you make sense of them and reduce their emotional impact on your psyche.

So when you wake up feeling ""reset,"" your brain, kind of like a computer running an automatic optimizer and defrag, has cleaned house, restocked its supplies, and organized its files, giving you a fresh emotional slate to start the day.",comment_1,r/explainlikeimfive,Education,,https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/1ktlqol/eli5_why_does_it_feel_like_sleep_resets_the_brain/
"Sleep activates the parasympathetic nervous system, which sends signals/chemicals throughout the body to induce relaxation. Its opposite, the sympathetic nervous system, is responsible for the body’s fight-or-flight response, so when that is activated you feel anxiety, fear, anger, etc.

So after hours of your parasympathetic nervous system being active, when you wake up your body has been used to the chemicals from that and not your sympathetic nervous system. That’s why your emotions feel “reset.” Once you’re awake, if you start thinking about what made you anxious, scared, angry, etc., your sympathetic nervous system will start to activate again.

Edit to add: This is also why people can get insomnia; their sympathetic nervous system is too activated for sleep to occur easily. 

Also, this is why people wake up from nightmares feeling the same “negative” emotions that they felt in their nightmare. Their sympathetic nervous system is being activated by the nightmare.",comment_2,r/explainlikeimfive,Education,,https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/1ktlqol/eli5_why_does_it_feel_like_sleep_resets_the_brain/
"A part of our bodies called the limbic system creates a circular connection between our thoughts/emotions and the physical sensations in our bodies of being scared, anxious, angry, or depressed.  Even though you can change your thoughts in a moment, your limbic system takes 5-15 minutes to calm down.  Until it does, the sensations in your body it caused will tend to bring your thoughts back to whatever first triggered your limbic system, re-triggering it.  Sleeping allows enough time for your limbic system to calm down, so when you wake you aren’t feeling scared, anxious, angry, or depressed in your body, and your thoughts aren’t being dragged back to whatever was upsetting you before.

Side note: things like meditation or emotion regulation skills let you calm your limbic system without needing to sleep.",comment_3,r/explainlikeimfive,Education,,https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/1ktlqol/eli5_why_does_it_feel_like_sleep_resets_the_brain/

"Because ethanol gets oxidised to acetic acid. Which the body runs through large amounts naturally anyway in the Krebs cycle and has zero issue coping with.

Whereas methanol gets oxidised to formic acid, which only ever exists in trace amounts in the body. 

It happens to interfere with the electron transport chain in the mitochondria. I.e. it prevents the mitochondria from getting energy from oxygen, which makes cells die in order of oxygen consumption, hence the blindness and neurological damage because nerve cells are extremely sensitive to even just temporary lack of oxygen.

Specifically formic acid and it’s a in Formate block cytochrome c oxidase in mitochondria. 

This is basically just bad luck, that the physics of binding make formate do this.

This is also how cyanide and hydrogen sulfide kill you: they just bind slightly differently.





And antifreeze ethylene glycol that is, kills you because it gets metabolised to oxalic acid/oxalate. Which happens to be able to form stable calcium complexes, I.e. it binds calcium in the blood, which leads to arrhythmias and stuff, because calcium is one of the essential electrolytes.




In both methanol and ethylene glycols the toxicity is the acids they get oxidised to by the same two enzymes via their aldehyde intermediates.


The glycol and methanol themselves aren’t more toxic than ethanol really.


So as long as you block the enzymes that metabolise short alcohols, you allow the kidneys to just excrete the unmetablised methanol or ethylene glycol leaving the person unharmed.


Since ethanol binds those enzymes the strongest, the simplest treatment for both methanol and antifreeze poisoning is to simply keep the person at a 0.1 BAC for 48hrs until they have peed out the toxic alcohols.

"A couple things.  Square cube law applies, and the ELI5 version of that is that when something is halved in length, its weight is reduced to an eighth.  That is because it is also going to be half as wide and half as thick, which is a half, times a half, times a half.  So the ant that is 1/300th as long as you are tall is about 1/27,000,000th as heavy.  This means it is easy to hold themselves up because they are very small.  
The second major factor is their feet or whatever they have.  They either have sticky feet which don’t have to hold up much so it doesn’t need to be very sticky, or they have hairy feet.  Basically they have spines on their feet that hook into tiny cracks that are too small to see and that holds them up.  There are likely a great many other options to hold on to things.  I am no expert.  Suction cups probably?  Anyway",comment_3,r/explainlikeimfive,Education,,https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/1kubas2/eli5_why_insects_are_able_to_crawl_up_walls/
"It's because of the square-cube law.

Mass scales with *density*, not with length. As a result, a fly that is 1/100th the height of a human has 1/1000000th (one millionth) of the mass of a human, roughly speaking. That means things that depend on length, or surface area, are very important at small size, and much less important at large size. And it turns out that clinging to a wall by using adhesive forces is mostly proportional to surface area, not volume.

So the fly's weight is proportional to its volume, but its adhesion to the wall is proportional to its surface area. This means that while the fly experiences one millionth of the gravity a human does, it experiences one ten-thousandth of the adhesive forces it would if it were human-sized. In other words, the adhesive force became stronger *relative* to gravity by a factor of 10. Eventually, at a sufficiently small scale, this pretty much guarantees that adhesion will be stronger than gravity.",comment_4,r/explainlikeimfive,Education,,https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/1kubas2/eli5_why_insects_are_able_to_crawl_up_walls/

One is, their exoskeleton is more efficient in terms strength. It's better for the muscles pulling from the inside than from the outside, their skeleton is relatively lighter, and that altogether makes them stronger for their body size than mammals.        

Second, due to the square cube law, a smaller animal is always relatively stronger than a large one. Now, insects live on a different scale. Mammals live from the mouse to elephant scale, insects are somewhere between 20 cm down to part of a millimeter. Which means the normally ""visible to us bugs"" are pretty much on the mid-low part of the scale. Think cats or squirrels on the mammal scale. Those are much better climbers than elephants.

About 100,000 to 200,000 thousand years ago, we discovered control of fire for use in cooking, warmth, and even protection from predators. Now we could prepare more food, keep them for longer, keep ourselves warm and survive different climates better, and we could keep predators at bay more easily.

100,000 years ago we developed clothing and started building rudimentary shelters, instead of having to rely on caves and natural formations. This also allowed us to travel larger distances and spread out to environments we previously couldn't.

70,000 - 40,000 years ago we began establishing languages and abstract thinking, as well as symbolic art (lots of cave paintings have been found from this time period). This exploded our ability to communicate, share ideas, plan, strategize, trade, share experiences, and so on.

40,000 years ago we began making more advanced and relatively complex tools, such as needles, fishing hooks, rigging, instruments, more advanced clothing, and lots of other things.

10,000 years ago larger scale agriculture begins, and larger and more permanent settlements begin forming across regions. This period is also called the Neolithic Revolution.

Now things really start to speed up and the next 10,000 years see more technological advances than the past 300,000 years combined.

Each of these inventions came as a result of finding out something new about how the world works. The reason why it took so long at the start was because we were just animals. We had no idea how anything worked or why they worked that way, but with each new discovery, a whole new world opened and it had a massive snowball effect. We solved problems to make things easier for ourselves, the easier we had it, the easier it was to do more things in new ways, which resulted in more problems being solved, and so on.

1. PPA where solar company owns / maintains the panels and you agree to buy their power per kWh

When you are asleep your brain can still hear things from outside.  That's why you can wake up if you hear an alarm.  Many people will wake up if someone calls them by name.,comment_2,r/explainlikeimfive,Education,,https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/1ku30ag/eli5_dogs_selective_hearing_whilst_sleeping/
"Same way humans do. There are some sounds that their brains are highly attuned to, and when they hear them their brains tell them to wake up right now. And most dogs are food motivated, so when their brain hears the treat bag, or their owner (giver of the treats) that is sufficient motivation for them to wake up. And, they have super good hearing. So the effect is exaggerated.

People are the same way. Ears and brains are never fully turned off. When you sleep it is not dead silence all the time. You brain is ignoring plenty of sounds. But if it hears a sound that it knows is important it wakes you up. This sound could be something learned, like an alarm clock or a loved one’s voice, or it could be instinctual, something the brain interprets as danger. 

And it should be noted that also like humans, dogs sleep more and less deeply at different times. They are much more likely to easily wake from a light afternoon nap than when they are deeply conked out in the middle of the night.",comment_3,r/explainlikeimfive,Education,,https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/1ku30ag/eli5_dogs_selective_hearing_whilst_sleeping/
Humans can do this too.  You can train yourself to be aware of certain sounds.  I learned this as a parent.  I could sleep through a car alarm across the street.  At the same time if my two year old got out of bed on the other side of the house I would hear it and wake up.  It is a sound that at no other time in my life I would have noticed but I was alert for it.  I have heard the same thing from combat vets.  Woodsmen.  People used to being in unsafe positions.

ELI5: Why is flooring it to 60mph less fuel efficient than slowly accelerating?,post,r/explainlikeimfive,Education,959.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/1ktcudd/eli5_why_is_flooring_it_to_60mph_less_fuel/
"Not sure if everyone here is just greatly oversimplifying because this is eli5, or just guessing because more rpm=more fuel does seem logical... but basically everyone is wrong. There's more to it than just rpm.

Brake specific fuel consumption, or BSFC, is a measurement of how much fuel per energy produced an engine uses at different rpms and loads. The lowest fuel/energy point is universally NOT better at lower rpms, but usually will look the best around 2000-4000rpm at higher engine loads, depending on the engine, engine type, etc. of course there are outliers like a cruise ship engine or a formula 1 engine but you get the point. Google ""brake specific fuel consumption"" to see some cool graphs!.

Because of this, neither accelerating extremely slowly or extremely quickly is the most efficient. It's really somewhere in the middle.

This is why people who are ultra-obsessed with pushing high mpg's (hypermiling I think is what they call it?), will pulsate their speed like a sine wave - instead of a constant speed in a lower BSFC area of their engines operation, they load the engine up more, in a more efficient fuel/energy area of its operation and then coast a bit, repeating indefinitely.

"ELI5: How does temporal relativity square with spatial relativity?

But speed is also dependent on the frame of reference of the observer, right? That is Newtonian spatial relativity. So twin #1 could see twin #2 moving away at close to the speed of light. But twin #2 could also see twin #1 could also see themselves as stationary, and the rest of the universe moving away at close to the speed of light.

"What you've described is the time dilation of Special Relativity - and it's about how an observer perceives things happening in a different inertial frame.

BUT.

There's ANOTHER source of time dilation, in General Relativity, when acceleration/gravity (the two are equivalent) enter the picture - and that's the one that matters here. Time goes slower under acceleration/in a gravity well. And that's a real change, not just a matter of some observer's perception. Orbital satellites have to compensate for time moving slightly faster up in orbit than it does down on earth, for example. 

The Twins ""paradox"" isn't a paradox, because it isn't symmetrical. One of the twins undergoes acceleration multiple times - to speed up, slow down at the far end, speed up again to head back, and finally slow to a halt. And all the time they're doing that, time is moving slower for them. The other just stays in one place. So when they meet again, the twin who made the trip has experienced less time than the other. Simple as that.",comment_4,r/explainlikeimfive,Education,,https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/1kui3wc/eli5_how_does_temporal_relativity_square_with/
"> So twin #1 could see twin #2 moving away at close to the speed of light. But twin #2 could also see twin #1 could also see themselves as stationary, and the rest of the universe moving away at close to the speed of light. 

Yes! And both perspectives are valid. This is the classic ""[twin paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twin_paradox).""

The key to resolving it is that at least one of the twins *must have accelerated*. If they accelerated, they did not stay in the same inertial reference frame.

Acceleration is what causes your ideas of time and space to twist around; as you accelerate spacetime twists around you (well, around *c*).

In the simple version of the twin paradox [one twin stays on Earth, the other twin zooms out into space and then returns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Twin_Paradox_Minkowski_Diagram.svg). On the way out, from Earth's point of view the zooming one's time runs slow (and lengths are contracted). From the zooming one's point of view - as you note - it is the Earth that is moving, so the Earth's time is slowed (and the entire universe is contracted spatially).

The same is true for the return journey. From each one's perspective, the other is moving, so the other experiences time dilation (and length contraction). And both are right.

Except the zooming one *has to turn around in the middle*. When they do that, they switch their reference frame - their ideas of time and space twist around.

And you can see that in the diagram above. The blue lines are lines of ""now"" for the travelling twin on the way out. The red lies are lines of ""now"" for the travelling twin on the way back. The dots represent events (""here and now"" points) from both perspectives. So on the way out, from the travelling one's point of view, the Earth's times are squished together - less time passes on Earth than for the travelling twin. But as they turn around a huge amount of time passes on Earth. Earth ""catches up"" and ""overtakes"" the travelling twin (from the travelling one's point of view). On the return journey, less time travels on Earth, and they meet up at the end.

If you want to see a version of this with the numbers [there is also this diagram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:TwinParadoxProperAcceleration2.svg). Red is the ""travelling twin"", blue is the ""Earth twin."" The bold lines are their worldlines (from the Earth's point of view), the thin lines are lines of ""now"" for each of them.

> But speed is also dependent on the frame of reference of the observer, right? That is Newtonian spatial relativity.

Yes. This is Newtonian or Galilean Relativity. Special Relativity starts with two assumptions. One is the Relativity part (that the laws of physics are the same in all inertial reference frames). The ""Special"" part of Special Relativity is the extra rule, that *c* is the same for all inertial observers.

Special Relativity is a special version of Galilean, regular, Relativity, with this extra rule that leads to some fun things.

In reference, driving casually in a manual gas car, you're probably changing gears at like 2500 to 3500 rpm. They're IDLING at almost peak torque of a big rig.

"Finally, a question I feel qualified for. I've been driving big trucks for only a couple of years now, but I've only driven manuals. 

I just want to first say that most cars have RPMs that go from 700 at idle to 7,000 at max RPM. My truck idles at 800 RPM and max RPM IS 2,000. The RPM range I drive in is between 1,200 and 1,800. I only have 600 RPM available, which is when the the engine makes is peak power and torque.

Imagine you had 2 bikes. One is a single gear beach cruiser, and the other was a 21 speed tour bike. You will need to exert a lot of effort to get that cruiser up a steep hill. That 21 speed bile can be put in 1st gear, and you might pedal quickly, but it won't tire you out.

The dump trucks I drive weigh 55k pounds fully loaded. It takes a LOT of effort to get up to speed in a vehicle that weighs that much.

The more gears you have, the less effort it takes to get moving. My truck has a 10 speed. It has LO and LO LO, which I never use on the road because the max speed is 5 mph. It then has gears 1 through 8 that I primarily use when driving. I have to shift into 7th gear at 35 mph. That 7th gear only gets me to 45ish mph, and 8th gear gets me to 70 mph.

It just makes it so you don't need to push your truck as hard to get up to speed.

The most common transmissions are 13 and 18 speeds. How they work is they have a LO gear and 8 gears. Each of those 8 gears has the possibily to be ""split."" Think of it as half gears between main gears. On 13 speeds, only the final 4 gears split, whereas the 18 speeds split all 8 speeds.

13 speed goes 1--2--3-4--5--5.5--6--6.5--7--7.5--8--8.5.

It's partially why you hear about the cures and then someone fires off the hot take ""LoL NEVEr gOiNg TO SeE THiS agAiN"".... because it likely only cures one type of cancer. Like the rectal cancer that had 100% of people in the trial be cured from it.... but they all had the same rectal cancer, with the same type of rectal cancer, with the same genetic markers. So it's great for them, but *may* not work on the other types. (There are other issues why some things people hear about never come up again like sensationalized media reporting for clicks not info like reporting it's a cure but possibly only works in a petri dish but [would actually give a regular human a worse disease than cancer](https://xkcd.com/1217/), or worked in rats/monkeys/pigs etc but failed human trials later.)

The second part is because cancer is mostly made up of cells from the host. It's *from* the cells of the host and connected to it. Killing foreign bacteria is relatively easy, it's finding something that is deadly to bacteria but not humans. Finding something that won't kill the human but will kill the cell made 99% of their DNA and shares their blood stream... less easy.

This does run into several issues, of course. A woman past menopause can't produce fertile offspring, nor can an organism with injuries in the wrong place, nor can one too young. Nor, usually, can same-sex organisms. One way around that is ""could this organism, or any of its parents, at any point in their life cycle, produce fertile offspring with this other organism, or any of its parents, at any point in their life cycle?"" 

This still doesn't cover every base - there's still ring species and asexual species.

"ELI5: Frame generation in newer titles? I was poking around in the settings for The Last Of Us Part II and noticed an option for frame generation. I noticed a spike in FPS and smoother camera movement, but what actually is this technology?",post,r/explainlikeimfive,Education,0.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/1kul3kw/eli5_frame_generation_in_newer_titles/
It’s like a more advanced version of the motion interpolation setting on your TV. The game generates two frames normally and then frame generation takes those frames and figures out what the frames between them would look like. ,comment_1,r/explainlikeimfive,Education,,https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/1kul3kw/eli5_frame_generation_in_newer_titles/
"Your game is still rendering the same number of frames. It might render frame 1, then 2, then 3.

Conventionally, your display would immediately show frame 1, then 2, then 3. But with frame gen, that's a little flipped on its head.

Your graphics card gets frame 2, but uses that to calculate an interim frame between frame 1 and 2. So the order goes from 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, and so on. Because the .5's can only be generated *after* the next frame is already rendered, it introduces some delay. This means you can get input delay on games using frame gen. On something like TLOU, that is potentially minimal. On something much more reflex sensitive, like FPS games, it can be a downside.",comment_2,r/explainlikeimfive,Education,,https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/1kul3kw/eli5_frame_generation_in_newer_titles/
"The basic idea is that the game is using a difficult, resource-intensive process to generate ""real"" frames of the game to display. It needs to have all the game assets in memory, calculate what can be seen from the camera, all the lighting, all the post-processing effects, etc. Finally it produces a nice, clean frame and can start on the next. However when you are making a bunch of those a second (30-60 frames typically) then it isn't *that* difficult to just guess at what the next frame likely is going to look like. An algorithm can be trained on what that specific game usually looks like, and since not very much is likely to change between each frame it can alternate between showing a ""real"" frame and a generated frame, doubling your frame rate while not having that significant an impact on how hard it is to produce.

Key to this working is that ""generating"" a frame from the previous is much easier than the usual rendering process. For the real frames the game needs all the resources and information about the world to make the image, but generating the frame is mostly just using the previous frame as a starting point. If the aim is to predict just one frame afterwards then it can look pretty good, and the higher your starting frame rate the shorter the prediction needs to be. So if you are already running at 60 fps then alternating between real and generated frames gets you to 120 fps while the generated frame is only 1/120th of a second after the real frame it was based on. How much can really change in that period of time and how long does someone have to pick out minor errors?

Frame generation can only go so far though because it doesn't really know very much if anything about what is going on in the game. You can't generate frames from scratch for example, it needs the traditional and more difficult ""real"" frame rendering pipeline to feed into the generation algorithm. But if you really want to push it the technique can generate 2, 3, or even 4 frames after a single ""real"" frame (although it starts to get pretty rough at the 4th).",comment_3,r/explainlikeimfive,Education,,https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/1kul3kw/eli5_frame_generation_in_newer_titles/
"[Linear interpolation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2RU9FX2EJ4). The game renders two frames and then these algorithms interpolate the pixels position at any time between those two frames to create new frames. 

The game knows position of each pixel in ""game space"" so it can calculate a formula for a line that describes how that pixel is moving from frame 1 to frame 2. Frame 1.5 can be calculated as where a pixel would be in space as it moves halfway between where it is in frame 1 and frame 2. 

So just calculate the new position of each pixel for half way between those frames and now you have 3 frames instead of 2. Do that again and from frame 1 and 1.5 and 1.5 and 2 and now I have 5 frames instead of 2. Display 5 frames to the player but the game only rendered 2 means my frame rate went up 150% for ""almost free"". As those calcualation are much easier to do than what the game itself does.

The downside of this is the game has to render 2 frames before it can show you anything and so your latency is increasd by an entire frame time. If the game is running at 30fps then it's an extra 33.3ms of lantecy.

Now, you might ask why would any game not just interpolate most of it frames instead of rendering them. Besides the increased latency there are types of movements you simply can't describe properly in linear terms. Basically anything animted that isn't moving at a constant speed /has a rotational aspect is going to fail.

Take a wheel for example. 

Say you a wheel that is spinning so fast that it makes a complete rotation between frame 1 and frame 2. When you interpolate it's position all the inbetween frames it will describe the wheel as moving through space properly but it won't show any rotation. It only knows the wheel (the pixels decribing it) moved from A to B but it doesn't know it rotated while doing so. 

But even if it didn't do a full rotation, the pixels on the wheel are not moving through space at a constant speed and thus can't accurately be described with linear equations. So the inbetween frames will show some movement but it won't resemble a rotation. It'll look more like a cross fade / blend / morph. 

Pretty much all character animations will have this sort of problem because rarely are they comprised of simple linar movements. Really any movement that isn't constant of velocity can't be described in linear terms.",comment_4,r/explainlikeimfive,Education,,https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/1kul3kw/eli5_frame_generation_in_newer_titles/
"It's fairly simple. Nvidia's frame generation works by rendering additional frames in lower resolution and upscale them using their machine learning based upscaling method (DLSS). It makes motion smoother (effectively it's like motion blur just very different technically) but can cause visual artifacts like DLSS in general (for the exact same reason). 

Usually the weird stuff you can notice is how objects that have nothing to do with each other but get close on the image (like the gun in your hand and the stuff in front of you) end up getting blurred together. (Because the tech doesn't know what's being displayed.) How annoying the artifacts are relative to the smoother camera motion, well you have to judge!",comment_5,r/explainlikeimfive,Education,,https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/1kul3kw/eli5_frame_generation_in_newer_titles/

I also don't see any real limit on how much you can speed this up by making the burn barrel hotter.


Since the limit is getting oxygen to the wood other methods go at that. Burn in high-oxygen air.

"Yes, but the answer is oxygen, not a higher temperature.

Fire is a reaction between oxygen and your burnable matieral.  Once you reach a high enough temperature what slows that reaction is the time it takes for new oxygen to flow into the sytem.  You can see this as blowing on a fire makes it flare up - the heat is there you are just adding oxygen faster for bigger fire.

If you have a large piece of wood even blowing in pure oxygen won't let it all burn at once because the oxygen can only reach the wood on the outside - it has to burn away the outer wood before the oxygen can reach the inner wood.

So - to burn it all at once you need to cut your wood up into tiny dust like pieces, throw it up into the air so all the little pieces are touching oxygen, and have the air be oxygen rich.  When you do this it will all burn at once - this does happen and we call it an explosion.

The second and far greater issue is that from one end to another an nba court is only a few meters longer than the distance from home to first base while the three point line right around a quarter that distance which combined with lower arcs means basketballs spend far less time in flight as opposed to baseballs.

"No, but so far people are getting the reason --- not right.

Basketballs are moving pretty slow (order of magnitude 10-20 Mph)

Air resistance is based on your speed SQUARED.  So the impact of air resistance on something like a basketball, moving 20Mph (20 \^2 = 400) is going to be less than 5% of the impact of air resistance of something moving 100Mph (100 \^ 2 = 10,000, 400 is about 4% of 10,000)

This accidentally had the effect of causing most mammals to not like eating the plant, while birds, whose taste buds aren't affected by the chemical, continued to eat it.

The thing is, mammal digestive tracts are generally slower than bird tracts, which, if a mammal eats a seed, the acids in the tract will have made them useless by the time they come out.

Meanwhile, a bird digestive tract doesnt have it sit in acid anywhere near as long, and birds can also travel quite a distance before they tend to poop.

This means the fruit became less likely to be eaten by the animals that wouldn't spread their seeds, while having their seeds dispersed by the animals that DIDNT destroy their seeds.

Be genuine, real.

If you are sharing a common experience, at the same event, doing the same thing, you can just say something out loud, well that was interesting, or oh my God, I have no idea what Im doing, or wow, I didn’t know that, and look at the person….just be very open and real.

"Perfect answer from [plytime18](https://www.reddit.com/u/plytime18/s/yJ50Hh4tsB). To add onto that, you can treat conversations like Google and Twitter: you go to Google to ask questions and you go to Twitter to make a statement.    
    
**Twitter Example:** *“It’s hard to make small talks because I never know what to talk about.”*

**Google Example:** *“Do you find it easy to make small talks?”* (Whatever the answer could be, you can simply ask, “why is that?”) 
  
Pair both of these examples together, and you’ll come across more like a great conversationalist instead of an interviewer asking questions all the time. Ask the whys and the hows for open questions and especially for answers that doesn’t end with “yes” or a “no”. Everything can be explored by leading with curiosity and asking these questions, and sometimes, making a random statement can invite someone to question you the same way, creating a fun dialogue together.   
  
Just think about the times where you have Googled something or had happy thoughts about the dishes you ate or anything that evoked certain emotions in you. Redirect that curiosity towards the other person and ask them open-questions. Often times, we ask these questions because of our own personal experience. You’ll find similarities and differences, but when you ask these questions, you enter into a state of exploring and investigating. 
  
Small talks can sometimes lead to deeper conversations, and you can learn a lot from a person just by asking questions and piggybacking off that. Open question is the key, but don’t be afraid to add in your opinions also. Let the conversation flow. You are actively learning about someone during those few minutes of small talks. Conversation is really all about exchanging thoughts and questions.",comment_2,r/IWantToLearn,Education,,https://www.reddit.com/r/IWantToLearn/comments/1kul3ja/iwtl_how_to_properly_do_small_talk_and_have/
"IWTL How to Stop Hating Things So Intensely Whenever I start to hate something (mostly interests) I don't just hate it, I become obsessed in searching for this specific topic, whether it's negative comments to validate what I'm feeling or feeling angry at people who like something (and I don't even argue with them, I just watch from afar) even if it's something stupid... Usually my anger only goes away after 1/2 weeks,Maybe out of shame or because my brain assimilates that it is not that deep, but it's tiring to feel so much hate for something so pathetic. 

It's exhausting to feel things so intensely that they don't matter after a while, I get anxious and short of breath trying to process why I feel hate and I feel like looking for the things that make me angry, I stop and sit down to think about why I feel this way, trying to name my feelings and how I should overcome them with maturity, but my brain doesn't seem to learn a lesson quickly,and that also makes me anxious because I know it's not that serious but why the hell can't I stop feeling like that",post,r/IWantToLearn,Education,33.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/IWantToLearn/comments/1ku9wcj/iwtl_how_to_stop_hating_things_so_intensely/
"Two ideas

First, fake it till you make it. When you think a negative thought in your brain, out loud say something positive. Try hard to be nice. Even fake nice. When people are happy they laugh and smile, and this connection is so strong if you smile and laugh it can trigger you to be happy. Same idea. If you fake positivity it can actually conjure positivity. Even if it's just enough to counteract the anger and get you neutral

Second idea, you have too much time. Emotions have a half life meaning you can't be angry forever, sad forever, happy forever eventually it dies down. If you are angry for 1/2 weeks you are re-triggering that emotion. You need other things to preocuppy your time and thoughts. 

I got divorced once and it was in a February and literally thought about it and cried everyday until November. Actually one day I didn't think about it and the next day I realized and then that made me cry hahaha. And in that November I went to Marine Corps Boot Camp. And there is so much happening, it's mentally challenging, it's physically challenging. You're meeting new people, making new connections, learning a bunch, practical application, new environment. And so my whole time there I didn't think about the divorce. 

Actually I did think about it because we got letters and she was the one person who would write to me. But even when I had 1 hour at night to read the letters I had so many things I needed to do I couldn't be sad for long. And once I got out I could talk about it and think about it without crying. I still think about it but not everyday. And it can just be a fleeting thought and not cause such an intense reaction.

I'm not saying go to bootcamp but join a soccer club, learn guitar and take lessons, dance classes, group gym fitness classes, karaoke with friends or strangers on sunday nights. Like do activities that take you out of your everyday that are active and with other people and this will reset things. And when you come back to your average life you might be able to see those things that sparked anger differently or not think about them at all.",comment_1,r/IWantToLearn,Education,,https://www.reddit.com/r/IWantToLearn/comments/1ku9wcj/iwtl_how_to_stop_hating_things_so_intensely/

"Firstly, the problem seems to be a lack of confidence in your resume, am I correct? You can try asking friends, relatives, or upload it to job specific or support subreddits for help. However, I think the more you think of it as just another part of the process, the less intimidating it could be.


I remembered when I just graduated, with a very similar mindset to yours, worried a lot about so many things. And quickly realized how much Im just making it worse for myself. There are people that would read my resume, there are those that will care about how your resume looks, worded, whether you have a picture, whether you are the right person for the company/the right personality for the team. 


But there are also those that are totally opposite, those that wont read your resume, those that will hate how your resume looks, how you look, all for reasons you cant control. Hell, they might be posting a position out of obligations, and actually have zero care about hiring anyone. Or the company is going through restructuring, and your position is now in limbo until they clean up their shit. Or maybe it’s simply that HR is having a really bad day. You won’t know any of that, unless you have inside info, and even then all it gives is closure.


Right now, focus on just applying. Whether or not it’s “right” or “wrong” is not your job, literally. And you will never know if you are the right fit until you actually do the job. The more you overthink, the heavier the act gets for yourself, and you wont get anywhere fixing your resume over and over until you actually start applying.

Adlerian psychology says that our actions all achieve some predetermined goal. Maybe you don't feel you deserve the results of long term consistency so you reject the process and quit early. Maybe you don't want the responsibility of being that guy forced to always have to workout or eat well or wake with the sun. Maybe your goal is comfort or mediocrity.

"Waking up early requires you to go to bed early or to take a nap during the day, otherwise you won’t be getting enough sleep. Getting enough sleep is key for any sleep schedule changes. 

How to wake up early: 

1. Learn how much sleep you actually need. (Day One) 

On a day off, let yourself sleep in, no alarms, no distractions from pets or house mates, phone on complete silence/ turned off, just blissfully sleep until you wake up naturally. Write down how long you’ve slept, what time you went to bed and what time you woke up. Now you have your starting point. 

2. Adjust your lifestyle. (Week One) 

Majority of people don’t actually sleep long enough and they don’t get enough quality sleep. Start doing things to prioritize sleep: 

- stop drinking caffeine at least 6 hours before bed
- no liquids for 2 hours before bed to prevent late night bathroom trips
- eat your last snack/ meal 2-3 hours before bed 
- limit any cannabis/ alcohol consumption 

3. Start waking up earlier (Week 2-4)
Shift your wake-up time 15–30 minutes earlier every 2–3 days until you reach your goal. 

What you do with the extra time in the morning is really important! I like my mornings to be more for my hobbies rather than being productive. If I sleep in more than expected, I still have the rest of the day for productive activities and I just miss out on a bit of reading or video games instead.",comment_4,r/IWantToLearn,Education,,https://www.reddit.com/r/IWantToLearn/comments/1ku5l59/iwtl_im_tired_of_starting_over_i_want_to_build/

"IWTL How to Build My Own Retro-Style Arcade Cabinet From Scratch. Hi everyone!

I've recently become fascinated with retro gaming and would love to create my very own arcade cabinet from scratch—not just buying a kit, but learning the skills to design, build, and customize one myself.

I know this will involve a mix of woodworking, electronics, and probably some programming (especially if I want to use something like Raspberry Pi for emulation). But I'm not sure where to start or how to break the process down into manageable stages.

I’m hoping to learn:

* What basic tools and materials I’ll need to start woodworking for this project.
* How to set up the electronics—joysticks, buttons, speakers, monitor, etc.
* Which software is best for running retro games (like RetroPie vs alternatives).
* Tips for designing the cabinet layout and artwork.

If anyone has built one before or knows good guides, books, or even YouTube series that take you through the entire process, I’d be super grateful!

"I am going to recommend 3 things that may help. 
1. Every day, preferably in the morning, do some form of exercise. No matter how light or how much you don’t want to do it. If you need to tell yourself you are only going to do it one day, or that you can rest again afterwards, that’s ok. Just keep repeating this every day. It will increase your energy level and mood so that you can actually put plans into action.  

2. Every day, preferably before falling asleep at night, spend at least 5 minutes in quiet contemplation. You can call this prayer. You can call it meditation. You can call it breathing. You can call it staring out a window. 

3. Once you pick an activity, stick with it for at least six months. Let’s say you decide to learn Japanese. In that case, once you’ve made the decision or signed up for Duolingo or whatever, resist the temptation to change to German or French because they seem easier, or to learn guitar instead because you think you’ll like it better. Give it six months so you can get past the initial effort and then if you still want to switch, go for it. By that point, you will have amassed at least a little skill of which you can be proud, and you’ll have also practiced persistence and learning your own mind, which will help you with your other goals. 

Good luck! We’re rooting for you. :)",comment_3,r/IWantToLearn,Education,,https://www.reddit.com/r/IWantToLearn/comments/1kty2iq/iwtl_how_to_be_more_motivated_and_get_my_life/

"IWTL How to stop rushing tasks /taking shortcuts / doing things half-assed Small background:

It's been a constant problem for me since childhood that I would take shortcuts and just... get by. Thing is I've done things ""good enough"" - C's get degrees sort of vibe. So let me explain how pathological this is, because I've been self aware for a minute now.

Also yes, I am Gen Z, and have the attention span of a gerbil. I can't sit through a 2 hour movie without breaks, and reading novels if physically painful for me. I'm not trying to be a study on the effects of TikTok on America's youth, I'm trying to figure out how to reverse that engineering.

Today's example:

Today was one of those times. Shower divider popped out of the spout so I tried to fix it. I was already sort of in a rushed mode to get it done (for absolutely no particular reason mind you it's a free Saturday. Maybe because I was in a rush to start enjoying Saturday and this was an unexpected annoyance?).  So I had this... rushed feeling right below my rib cage.

So I decided to take it one step at a time in the most half assed way. Watched a quick 2 minute video that I literally was impatiently skipping through to just start the real work already, so I didn't listen to any tips or anything. At the task, first I didn't want to get on my back to get a better angle from underneath because that was an extra step not covered in the video. I did notice that I was rushing again, internalized it, and overcame that to put it all back in. Okay went to test and it broke off again. Well let's try again.

BUT. Now there was a bit of water since I ran the spout, so I didn't want to A) Get on my back to re-do the work I already did, and B) Now it was wet. I literally had the idea to grab the towel two inches away for me to lay it down, BUT I didn't want to do EXTRA extra work to then be in a position to then REDO the work I already did, and I rationalized that it would get wet anyways if I ran it again, forcefully (willingfully) ignoring that I could move the towel before that (because that would ALSO be extra step probably).

So then I put it back in without looking like I wanted to the first time, and now I put it in diagonally, missing the inserts, but putting the chrome pull up bar back in, so it's locked in place with no room to move and I have to snap the plastic and buy a new one.  Not the end of the world, they're like $2, but I judged it to be a simple 30 second fix, so when I had to do extra steps that turned it into a 2 minute fix (an increase of 300%!!!!), I got impatient and sloppy.

Tl;dr / Questions:

My problem isn't that I can't do nitty gritty, low level, attention to detail focused work - if it's required. My problem is if I have 2 ways to do it, the right way and the easy way, I always twist and warp every reality around me to rationalize taking the easy way out. **Work smarter not harder has basically poisoned my work ethic.** To the point where I deceive myself to over-estimating how hard stuff is (like grabbing a towel) to justify not doing it.

1. What are some steps to catch that line of thinking, but also be driven enough to not rationalize an easier way out? Like if you know you have to do something, how do you force yourself NOT to find an excuse/reason to not to do it, in the context of a series of tasks.
2. What are steps to train discipline to do all the minor details? I feel like I should've joined the army where they beat uniform and bunk perfection discipline into me.
3. Ideally I would want to have a good internal dialogue of both right? So work smarter, not harder should be the goal, but not lying to yourself when it comes down to do the work either.",post,r/IWantToLearn,Education,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/IWantToLearn/comments/1kuecxx/iwtl_how_to_stop_rushing_tasks_taking_shortcuts/

* Watching younger kids for family, neighbors, or friends.
* Pet Sitting / Dog Walking
* Mowing lawns, raking leaves, weeding, watering plants.
* Car Washing
* Delivering newspapers

"You'll probably have an easier time renting a house than buying one, to start with, and renting can give you a chance to try out the new city & country to see if you like it. Usually there are specific places that houses, apartments, or rooms for rent are listed — I don't know what they are for Lichtenstein, but an example is that in New Zealand many rental houses are listed on TradeMe (which started out as an eBay clone).

When you look for a rental house, sometimes the power and internet are included in the rent and sometimes they aren't. It's more common for them to be included in things like boarding houses, where you have your own bedroom & bathroom but a shared kitchen. If they are included then you just get them as part of renting the house, if not then you have to sign a contract with a power company and an internet provider to get them. You can usually do this online. Contracts usually last a year and then automatically renew, and sometimes providers will give you a cheaper deal on the first year to try and get you to sign up with them. There are often tools that help you compare the different offers so that you can pick the best one.

You'll also need to find out how to get a visa, and the difficulty of that will depend on what country you're a citizen of. If you have citizenship with a European country it should be pretty easy (you may not even need one), if you're from the USA it will probably be okay, other countries it could be harder. If you do need a visa, one of the big things is that you need to prove you have enough money to cover your expenses while you're there, because they don't want people going broke and getting stuck there. I agree with the other comment suggesting you save up some money before moving over. You get a visa from the government of the place you're going to, not the airport, so you can find information about it on the website of the government.

If your parents are clingy, consider keeping your plans to yourself until you have everything ready. They may try and wear you down until you change your mind and decide not to move, if you tell them too early. This goes double if you think they'd be the type of people to sabotage your attempts to move out. It's okay to do things like open a bank account they don't know about to put your savings in, start getting copies of your critical documents like your birth certificate and passport, etc. When you're ready to go, you might be able to ease their clinginess by promising to video chat/phone call/message regularly, so that they don't get too worried about you .",comment_2,r/IWantToLearn,Education,,https://www.reddit.com/r/IWantToLearn/comments/1ktw71n/iwtl_how_to_actually_start_living_on_my_own/

I know better and I even know the consequences of lashing out, so now I’m actively working on avoiding triggers that make me angry, and when I feel angry, I stay silent. Even when I stay silent, I feel mad at myself for not lashing out because I have a strong sense of fairness. Nowadays, I am silent and biting my tongue when someone provokes me but I can’t let it go after. Staying silent is easy but the hard part is dealing w the feelings of insults and provocations, and not taking things personally.",post,r/IWantToLearn,Education,5.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/IWantToLearn/comments/1ktsllk/iwtl_how_not_to_take_insults_and_provocations/
"There was a [TED talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnJwH_PZXnM) about exactly this issue I recall seeing the other day, and it had some fairly good points I could resonate with having had this issue myself in the past. [This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BI4dBryghRk) also explores the psychology of it in a bit more detail.

In essence, it's all about what frame of reference we're working with, and how attached we are to fixing our own identities to an experience or a label. Social psychology talks a lot about how our perception of a situation is shaped by what we believe about ourselves. So when someone says something provocative, it’s easy to let that comment reinforce an insecurity or a narrative we already carry. I’ve started asking myself questions like: “Is this really about *me*, or could it be about something they’re dealing with?” or “What might I not be seeing about the situation?” which can often soften the weight of someone's words, and fix our worth to it much less once it's in perspective. Other people all have their own biases, narratives, limitations, and expectations about how the world works; their failure to acknowledge how their words affect you doesn't mean they're always right, but could be a product of deeper causes and issues we're often not aware of. In other words, what they know of your intentions to be, and what you know of them to be, may often be at a mismatch.

For me, if that doesn't work, however, sometimes I *am* the problem, but in a helpful sense to see where I have room to improve, not to deny my worth or potential, which is crucial here. Scathing words and provocations are intended to correct behavior, but if it's done out of bad-faith or a distorted knowledge of your intentions and perspective, it's a good reflection of how you may be received in the contexts you live in, and what you can expect others to do. In this case, staying silent is often better than contributing to this reactivity and escalating things further, but it doesn't mean you shouldn't process how you feel. It just means how you relate to those feelings, put them into context, and reconstruct your narrative (e.g. through journaling or other measures) about what's going on is crucial to not letting it ""get"" to you and control how you feel any further.

This of course takes time, and it's not to say every provocative remark is not worth responding to, but you are in charge of your time, your energy, and your story, to a good extent. If your intentions can't be communicated or clarified in a way that diffuses the situation, then it doesn't mean they don't exist, it just means the reciprocation of that understanding isn't in place for you to get it across, and that's going to happen a lot, particularly if it's coming from someone who doesn't truly *know* you that well.",comment_1,r/IWantToLearn,Education,,https://www.reddit.com/r/IWantToLearn/comments/1ktsllk/iwtl_how_not_to_take_insults_and_provocations/
"

This is a fantastic topic. Many different ways to view how not to be insulted.

What you provided is a great insight to your current strategy 
Feel insulted first > say nothing > begin self insulting 
Feel insulted first > lash out > begin self insulting 

Possible option as examples 

Feel insulted first > remember you care about fairness > self reflection for potential learnings> become curious how the insult was meant > seek clarity from Source  > fairness in awkwardness to both parties 


Choice of feeling insulted 
Just before you commit to the feeling of insult, repeat verbatim slowly, long pause, and ask what was the intent of that statement. Make them work for it. When they say to insult you, ask how they decided to want to do that.

Choice 
Give people permission to have their thoughts and opinions. Allow people to judge. They do it anyway. 
Their thoughts, opinions, and judgments are not you 

Fairness is fairness if you have your own thoughts let them have theirs 

It takes practice to know where you stop and others begin, having a clear boundary helps. 

Personally, I use different questions as my go to.
Interesting, why would you say that 
Interesting,  say more please 

Is there more to that statement?

"The biggest shift you could use in your thinking is to put yourself in their shoes. Often when we talk with someone, we’re using our normal, everyday heuristics that tell us what to expect, we draw our own mental maps of who different people are, what we think they’re like, and make a lot of assumptions about intentions before we even begin speaking. Shifting attention away from all that, to their vantage point, is an invaluable way to balance out how we habitually perceive other people. 

You can try it in small efforts, like asking yourself: “How would I feel if someone said that to me?” or “What might this person be going through today?”

What this does is it makes us rethink why we’re being harsh in the first place: is it misplaced anger, anxiety, frustration with my circumstances? Do I really need to add to their worries and fears by channeling this energy towards them? How might I be able to better match up my intentions with my words? 

If you know what you really mean to say, or what intention you’re trying to get across without it sounding harsh, take a second to pause and think if that’s the best way you could word it. It may take some practice, but giving yourself a buffer between when a thought or instinct arises and when you speak can be incredibly helpful. The key to this might be to say it to yourself first, in your head, and sit on it, or ask to take a breather if it’s a live conversation. Come back and speak from a place of clarity, depending on the situation.

What’s important is being more aware of how you think, and taking more control, being more deliberate, to be the gentler person you mean to be. One last tip is to seek out hanging around kind people too, or positively reinforcing social interactions that changes whatever default way of seeing people than you may be used to.",comment_2,r/IWantToLearn,Education,,https://www.reddit.com/r/IWantToLearn/comments/1ktenz0/iwtl_how_to_be_more_gentle_and_kind/

"IWTL How to become naturally and socially confident I have hit a low point in my life. Many things are going well, but the one thing bringing me down is my low social confidence.

So for some background. I have been a shy person ever since I was a child, I used to let my older brother talk to relatives when they came to visit, I hardly initiated conversations with friends in my class, and I took every chance I had to revert back to my comfortable space in the background. And it worked back then. People just called me cute because I was shy.

But now, it’s not cute anymore. I am just reserved, and every awkward interaction I have feels like a bullet to my heart. I notice that people become more quiet around me because I don’t give them the same energy back. I wonder if people think I have autism, since I am so awkward and unnatural in social settings, but it’s not that I am blind to social cues, sometimes I just forget to act on  them because I am so stuck in my head, thinking negative thoughts. I overanalyze everything I say. It has been going on for so long I can’t vision myself as anything else than awkward. I have lost hope…

If anyone has been in the same situation as me, and gotten out of it, please share me your advice. I know I have the capacity to become social. I just have no practice on how to act in these situations, since I have always been the observer, not really taking action.

Practice is what will help you feel more confident. And be yourself, if you like to make jokes then do so appropriately.

"1. Let yourself be akward/shy/quiet but do it anyway, so pretty much talk, try to do things, even though you feel like ""it's not you"" or it's not for you. Be active (""causative"" dunno if that's right word) So you need to make tons of mistakes, get used to them and don't treat yourself harsh, if you do it humbly people will gravitate more toward you. It will be suffering at the beginning.

How to not treat yourself too harshly ? Decide if negative thought help you in any kind of way, find some  + and - of doing it, write it down. Take big breath, take this paper with + and - to the trash bin and do it anyway, might sound dumb but works for me.

Maybe you are problem solver ? Some people need problem to help someone otherwise we don't engage. Keep in mind it might be defense mechanism.

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defence\_mechanism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defence_mechanism)

Other way is visualising yourself on death bed and seeing yourself being scared all the time.. After some time you will realise that there are tons people scared like you, and after seeing you trying they will feel encouraged to talk about it.

2. Being observer is very good, not taking action is worst you can do. But you not talking with many people like friends might be because you don't feel need to talk with them. You can't nor should like or try to like everyone. Let yourself be. First thing is realising what is in your head, why, question your rationalization mechanism.

3. Think about it how you see others, how you see yourself and most importantly how they affect you and what can they do for you. It might be really transactional but hey it might work. If you realise someone experience can help you, you might feel obliged to do it.

4.  Some people need a lot of time to open up, once it took me 4 years.. If that's the case for you, you might have some bad past experiences, so pretty much you need to feel safe with others, otherwise it won't work. Sometimes it's worth to try different people.. If your whole life was with ""toxic people"", u might try to defend yourself from past trauma.

Start slow, start simple, start short: when you drawing, don’t draw too fast; when you’re playing the chords and scales, don’t play too fast – let your muscle memory soak up the movement of the techniques. You should find YouTube videos and playlists covering the basics of piano playing and drawing and follow their exercises.

"IWTL  but always end up drowning in tabs when learning something new I built a tool to help visualize the connections. I'm sure many of you can relate to this: you start diving deep into a topic, reading article after article, and soon your browser is overflowing with countless tabs. You're trying to understand how all these new terms, ideas, or events connect, and your head starts spinning from the sheer volume of information and all the back and forth. This was a constant challenge for me. 😅That's precisely why ConceptMesh was born. It started from a personal need for a tool that would help me grasp complex subjects more quickly. I wanted to not just read but to see the connections. It all began as a simple script on my computer and gradually, step by step, grew into a fully functional website.Although I initially built it for myself, I truly believe that many others face a similar issue: students trying to get to grips with new topics, writers searching for deeper connections in their work, business professionals learning about new markets or technologies, or simply curious individuals who love to explore. So, how does ConceptMesh work? You enter a concept, and Concept Mesh generates a visual map with related terms and their links. You can click on each element, read its description, and expand the map further.Right now, the project is completely free and open for everyone to try. However, I want to be upfront: since processing information and generating these maps requires significant resources, depending on usage and server load, some usage conditions or limitations might be introduced in the future to ensure the quality of the service.I invite you to visit [https://conceptmesh.com](https://conceptmesh.com) to give it a try and, most importantly, share your thoughts or feedback.",post,r/IWantToLearn,Education,3.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/IWantToLearn/comments/1ktfxu7/iwtl_but_always_end_up_drowning_in_tabs_when/

"IWTL basic history and current events This is kind of embarassing, bear with me. My middle school history program was very poor, my US history teacher was a raging racist and taught us that abolition left all the former slave owners in poverty and that reconstruction was meant to punish the south (where I went to school, shocker I know), and my world history class only covered ancient history. I also had a very *interesting* upbringing, where I was banned from reading the news or following current events. Actually banned, I could go into a million examples of how but I had zero exposure to the news until 2020 (when I was 14 and got the internet).

So, the consequence of this is I have some MASSIVE gaps in my knowledge of history and the current state of the world. I obviously don't know what I don't know, but it was today that I learned what the Congo is, and that was an embarassing reminder that I don't know anything about what goes on in other countries/areas. I also didn't know what Taiwan was until a few months ago, thought Kasmir was a desert region in Africa (because of the song) until recently, didn't know that North Korea and South Kora were different countries until the 10th grade, thought the USSR was still a thing until I was a teenager, you get the idea.

I know how to learn more detailed history on Wikipedia and stuff, but that usually assumes you have at least basic knowledge of the world before hand. I started playing Geoguessr a lot, and that unironically helped, but now my knowledge is limited to countries that have street view coverage and mostly just stuff that's useful for identifying them. So I can identify Tunisia from a panorama of a market street with Arabic and French text, but I thought Algeria was in Europe. It's embarassing, it makes me look like an absolute moron talking to people. I'm not actually a moron, I just lived under an absolute rock for most of my life and only emerged recently. I've tried explaining this to people when the ""how the fuck do you not know this"" moments happen, but most people think I'm exaggerating when I say I was banned from having any news. I'm not, I didn't know who the president was until the 2016 election (which I only knew about because my parents followed it and told me about it).

I think your approach is half valid. You are setting up boundaries between your work and personal life which is GOOD and something not enough people do. Thinking like this can help avoid being taken advantage of at work, especially with the bullshit line people use ""bUt We'Re A fAmiLy HeRe"" 

However, we spend a LOT of our waking time at work. They are some of the people we see most in life, and humans are social creatures. You should socialize with coworkers while at work. It's going to make work more pleasant. It is completely fine to never attend social events outside of working hours (off the clock) with them, but avoiding socialization in the work place is a bad idea. It'll feel lonely, and realistically the loner who never talks to anyone will never get promoted regardless of how good their work is.

A mindful approach would be to notice how you actually vibe with someone. If you pay attention, you might sometimes notice that you don't actually feel attracted. 

Listen to what feels natural, not what you think you want. 

And when you feel there's a spark, don't be afraid to express that! Expressing genuine wants and emotions while being mindful of consent doesn't come off as desperate.",comment_3,r/IWantToLearn,Education,,https://www.reddit.com/r/IWantToLearn/comments/1krtvhy/iwtl_how_to_talk_to_girls_and_not_to_look/

"Iwtl how to stop letting other peoples shit talking affect me so much. Iwtl how to face people that I know dislike me, w/o fear or shame. So I noticed something about myself that I dislike quite a bit, and wanna change. Whenever I get word that a person is either speaking negatively about me, or thinks negatively about me, it literally consumes me in a way that isn’t healthy. I’ll begin to obsess over it, it’ll tank my mood, and overall, it’ll contribute to the negative image that I already have of myself. It also makes me afraid to face these people in person, almost as if I don’t deserve to be in their presence. The craziest part, is that most of the negativity towards me is unfounded, and I know that, yet in the moment, I just can’t get over it. 

I’ll give a recent example to show what this kind of looks like. At my previous job, my coworkers and immediate supervisor were just not good people. They would constantly put me down, disrespect me, violate my boundaries, exclude me, and lie to me and they would always justify it by saying that I need to stop taking things so personally because they “cared” about me and we were supposed to be a “family.” I tolerated this behavior for years and basically allowed myself to be a doormat until I eventually had enough. 

Since these guys kept holding the whole “family” thing over my head, I figured that I could talk to them like family. I tried to kindly express my concerns and the response I got was super adverse. They essentially all ganged up on me and collectively turned their backs on me. They started slandering me, gaslighting me into thinking that my feelings were unfounded, and that I was just being a “stereotypical woman” and acting in a way at work, that was clearly retaliation for what I had said. 

Once that happened I felt that it was clear that these people disliked me, so when I got the news that I needed to leave the job (as I was moving away) I decided to leave and not say a thing to them. It’s been almost three years since this happened. We all still work in the same company, just at different locations. It’s a small world and as much as I’ve tried to move on with my life, I still hear on an almost daily basis that these guys are STILL talking an insane amount of crap about me. I’ve sent some of my employees to conferences that these guys were at, and my employees would come back and tell me that these guys were telling them horrible things about me. 

My old supervisor is now in a much higher position in the company. Recently, he reached out to one of my employees to basically slander my work ethic and bitch about me over the phone. As soon as my coworker notified me of this, it ruined my whole day. I couldn’t stop thinking about it and it weighed be down for nearly a week. 

I am genuinely so sick of living like this. These people should not matter to me. Their opinions should not matter to me, especially since their negativity towards me is totally unjustified. I know that as long as I stay with this company, the day will come when I get to stand face to face with these guys again. I wanna be able to look them in the eye with confidence instead of feeling ashamed and like I don’t deserve to be in their presence. 

1. I want to learn how to stop letting people’s crap talking ruin my life. 

2. I want to learn how to not be afraid or feel ashamed when I have to face someone that I know doesn’t like me or is speaking negatively of me behind my back.",post,r/IWantToLearn,Education,8.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/IWantToLearn/comments/1ks8fms/iwtl_how_to_stop_letting_other_peoples_shit/

"I empathize, and I suffer from a very similar issue.

The obvious answer comes first: you have discovered that these people are actively antagonistic toward you - that is bad. By allowing yourself to continue working with/around them, you are making it *much* harder to get past it. You're not ever allowing yourself to forget, because they are an ever-present part of your daily environment. Even 'normal' people get stressed if they are forced to constantly be around people who view them as enemies. You need to get yourself into a healthier social environment.

That aside, here are two concrete tools I've found useful:

First, mentally zoom out on your life as far back as you can pull the lens. I like to start thinking about human history and how we developed from hunter gatherers to little towns and then somebody made up kingdoms and nations, and now we're all sitting it little boxes slapping our fingers on plastic keyboards so we can earn enough imaginary paper-points to have the vendor down the street hand us a burrito. When I remember that we're all just basically ridiculous little naked monkeys running around in hats pretending we're super important, it reminds me how trivial and unimportant those co-workers ""bad thoughts"" about me really are.

Second, give empathy a shot. I'll try to find a way to feel bad for the other person (even if I know they don't deserve it). Maybe they had shitty parents and they never learned how to really trust anybody, and they feel lonely and powerless, and now they're walking around lashing out at anybody they can just to feel some minuscule bit of control. Maybe they were taking anger out on you, but it was actually about something else happening in their life. Whatever. I find that just trying to flip my frame of reference and put myself in their imaginary shoes automatically turns down the volume on that part of my brain that feels under attack. 

None of that fully solves your problem, but you asked for input so that's the little bit I can offer.",comment_3,r/IWantToLearn,Education,,https://www.reddit.com/r/IWantToLearn/comments/1ks8fms/iwtl_how_to_stop_letting_other_peoples_shit/

"so firstly, inside of you you feel negative, when you hear negative remarks they might make you feel it deep inside, this is the fault line inside of you.

If two people, a bad person and a good person were to hear this statement; ""If you kill person x you will receive a trillion dollars"". The good person will hear murder and proclaim against it, the bad person will hear a trillion dollars and suddenly want it.
Negative things and positive things are only so relative to our beliefs. So when you feel bad about yourself and you hesr bad things its very very loud. The way your employees treat you, how they are willing to trust you with how your former employees slandered you to them, is basically a good choice alternate to them using the slander to manipulate others and try to toss you out of office from below for instance.

secondly, when you feel negative in these scenarios, its because the negative statement is affecting you because you are more open to people like this, the first step is to re analyze what the statement is, if there is evidence or no evidence, then assess their purpose with the statement. This should allow you to let you get it out your system before it does harm but it can be a little harder than you'd think to think straight, at least it is for me lol.

thirdly, once you assess the facts you will need to steer the conversation, ideally by using their own game against them, if they slander then you prove better or you uphold your quality and let the truth speak for itself. If theh bring up the past and it was bad, you can say yes, I remember that, Ive reconciled and overcome it, have you seen my new work etc. Basically remove their leg to stand on.

You can try to talk them into a circle where they kinda bite themselves by bringing them to their weaknesses, maybe they lie to their boss, or maybe they leave work to others, etc. If they do stuff like use their weight to throw it around, just pretend it doesen't work on you at all by borderline ignoring it or doing this analysis and cleanly handling but basically not being affected by their weight makes it seem weightless and they lose faith.

But basically the last step is to find a way either on top if you cannot let them go freely for any reason or to just let them go freely if you can because your life is precious and quite frankly remaining in a warzone only makes you more of a soldier, you need to seperate from negative things when you can to be positive, that doesen't mean forget how to fight back on the political front.

"iwtl how to keep learning after the first week of trying something new (that I want to learn). I want to learn how to do new things, but usually after like a week of trying something new, this thing will happen where all of a sudden it's like my mind is trying to do a 180 and makes me question if I should really be doing this. It makes me consider what my intent was is the first place and if it's still there- if I should keep going if I can't see the reason. I wanted it in the first place, so why is this happening? It's very frustrating and makes continuing day by day suddenly a lot harder.

Sometimes there are days where the anxiety is so immense, it feels like a wall of barbed wire I'd have to shred myself to walk through in order to do the thing.

There is a mental and physical resistance for me when I think about just sitting down and doing the thing I want to learn. Like there is some kind of ephemeral root that has a stranglehold on my mind that could be pulled out, or I actually feel like bashing my head against a wall (I've never done anything like this, I just internalize it until I reach a threshold and bawl out in private).

It feels cyclic, and I have to wonder if it isn't from some learned behavior from how I was raised or the choices I was allowed to make.



I was playing videogames almost daily for extended periods of time, until two months ago I decided to stop for a while because the thought of that was giving me anxiety. I wanted to see if I could improve myself in some ways. Since I've stopped, I always feel like I have a lot more time, but it feels like a void and I don't know what to do with myself. It's not a lot, but since then (and before) I've taken up reading, exercising, trying to just take better care of myself, and most recently drawing. A lot of what I said above can be attributed to trying to learn to draw recently, but it is not exclusive to only that.

So it's not impossible for me to pick up new things, it just feels like I'm trying to rebuild parts of my brain and failing at it. It feels like I don't know how to learn, and in the process of throwing myself at a wall trying to understand it, I get frustrated and stuck in a knot.

I have recognized that things like making a plan, setting smaller goals, having someone teach you, and learning with others may probably help in learning- it's an ongoing process. My brain shuts down often when I try to think about it, so all I can do is keep chipping away at it.



There are other things I would like to do, like learning to drive (I'm 23 and haven't learned yet), learn other languages, get a job, cook more, etc, But I'm trying to approach it one at a time.



I bet this all sounds desperate, and I don't know if this is the right place, but I just wondered if anyone had any two cents on if there's something I can do to work on this over time.",post,r/IWantToLearn,Education,4.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/IWantToLearn/comments/1ksdgdn/iwtl_how_to_keep_learning_after_the_first_week_of/

"hmmm, first I want to commend you for making active effort to improve your life and also for asking for help when you feel like you're lost. 

I am not sure that I got a good sense of what your issue is but to be fair I don't think that you do either. I would really urge you to explore why continuing is so difficult for you and trying to tackle it specifically. Is it because you are worries its going to be bad? Are you worrying that you are committing time to something that is not ""right"" for you? Is it because you believe that you don't want it ""bad"" enough?

You can only fix it if you can acknowledge it, sit down with yourself, or with a friend, try to talk it out because sometimes it takes explaining it to someone else for us to understand it ourselves. 

Don't be hard on yourself, in learning how to draw you are also learning how to learn. Also try to approach it a bit more curiously, rather than getting frustrated, try approaching it like a science experiment. 

Okay, this doesn't work? interesting, let me note that down and try this instead. This way will allow you to learn who you are and what works for you best.

Is it the lack of structure? Do you feel like you have to come up with a plan every day? maybe planning ahead of time for the week or for the month will make it better. Is it that you are trying to build your own syllabus that is so overwhelming? Find an online course or a pre-set program and it can be free too. Maybe its the time? Maybe its that you are doing it alone and that is boring? 

It is okay, take your time, try different things, this will teach much more than you think.",comment_3,r/IWantToLearn,Education,,https://www.reddit.com/r/IWantToLearn/comments/1ksdgdn/iwtl_how_to_keep_learning_after_the_first_week_of/
"I'll just refer to drawing as the topic for this.

I think it could be a handful of issues compounded into one problem, or maybe that's the easy way to think about it. I agree about sitting down and talking it out to figure out the ""why"" to this, I actually tried to do it before making this post but could not come to a concrete conclusion on my own. I thought it could be the lack of structure like you said, trying to decide on what to focus on when I don't understand a lot of it, making it feel aimless and overwhelming and without direction or guidance. I thought having someone else to work with might make the process more enticing to think about, being able to compare progress or bounce ideas off each other. I thought I could have someone teach me or give me things to achieve while they keep tabs on my progress (these rely on there actually being one of these kind of people, though). I found one course I could try, but I think I'm concerned and afraid because of the some things I'll say below. I'm positive there are other ways too, I just haven't thought of them or found them yet. I will keep trying again to think about the root of the issue.

I've mostly had help, restraints, or things done for me when something has to be done throughout my life (usually from family or education). So when I'm presented with something I want to learn myself like drawing, it's this huge open-ended problem where I feel like I'm drowning because there is no definitive answer. In a way, I think I'm searching for an answer rather than finding my own from looking at the problem itself. And I get the impression from my family and others that learning to draw is not what I ""should"" be striving to achieve right now. They're just trying to support me, but I feel some hidden pressure. So as much as I'd like to talk this out with someone else, I don't think it has helped trying to do it with family (sometimes it does, depending on the topic), and I'm not sure any of my friends or acquaintances are the kind of relationship to discuss something like that or at least drawing in specific.



Based on what you said, I thought about how I feel towards certain things related to drawing that may be contributing to this problem:

I'm not as worried as I used to be about the idea of it turning out bad. My intentions and ideas seem to wax and wane, so it further creates doubt on whether my desire to draw is really strong enough, or if it's just something I like the idea of- thoughts like ""should I really go through with this"", ""will I regret this considering the time needed to learn it"". I get envious and frustrated when I can't do things others artists can, even though I know I'm a beginner and I shouldn't expect myself to be able to do things people with years of experience can do. I see others ahead of me and think things like ""damn, how am I supposed to catch up to that?"" I know how long it can take and still I think ""holy shit, that's going to take forever, and I have to learn all of these things to get there."" I acknowledge things, but tend to use them as excuses which is a bad habit I am frustrated by.



I'm not sure I can wrap my head around approaching it more curiously, like a science project, but I'll see what I can do. The one thing I do have is time, which cannot be said for others. I'm fortunate I can take my time to approach this.

"To echo [gurganator](https://www.reddit.com/u/gurganator/s/UkMIIF9ho2), confidence comes from competence, and that means finding something to invest yourself in that you can be good at. Singing is a great venture, and since you just recently broke up, you can channel the emotional turmoils into writing your own lyrics, and maybe with that, you could get into learning how to write poetry. Search for more hobbies and explore.  
  
Your lack of confidence comes from your hyper-awareness of yourself and the pain you associate yourself with; it’s the same thing that makes you emotional intelligence. Instead of swimming in that pool of heartache, you can lose yourself in the quest to build  something in yourself, cultivating creativity and the cerebral departments. The more busy you become with the passions you love, the more confident you’ll become throughout the progress.",comment_4,r/IWantToLearn,Education,,https://www.reddit.com/r/IWantToLearn/comments/1krmqsf/iwtl_how_to_be_more_confident/

"Well, you pointed out three possible places to start: drawing skills, storytelling skills, and design skills. All of them are relevant, and starting with any of them would likely help support the others.

On a base level, you don't strictly NEED a lot of materials. Same as you don't NEED a ton of art supplies to start drawing or painting. Comics can be made with just pencil and paper, if you want. Digital options definitely have advantages, like an Undo button and such, but it's up to you. ProCreate on iPad is a good option, or there's stuff like Wacom drawing tablets to use with a PC.

One place I'd recommend looking is ""Understanding Comics"" by Scott McCloud. It's an examination of comics as an art form, including history and design and the psychology of how we read them, and it's made in the form of a comic book itself. It might help you feel less clueless about how to start and what skills to learn.",comment_1,r/IWantToLearn,Education,,https://www.reddit.com/r/IWantToLearn/comments/1krmg45/iwtl_how_to_do_comics/

"Part 1, start lowering the nicotine content.  Assuming you have a mod or something you put juice in, they oftentimes sell juice that is 0mg of nicotine.  Start by getting a 5mg/3mg and a 0mg and over the next few weeks/months start diluting the juice when you refill by mixing them together.  This takes care of the physical addiction to nicotine.

Part 2, distance is your friend.  Leave your vape on a shelf in another room.  Want a hit? Go to the vape, take the hit, put it back down and go back to the other room and keep doing what you were doing.   After a few days put it on the other side of your place, then leave it in your car.  Always have it close enough that you can get to it but far enough that it becomes a pain in the ass to use.  This takes care of the proximity issue of convenience.

a. how districts go about choosing software to be used in their classrooms

b. to what extent educators are aware of privacy and security policies instituted in the school district or school they work for

c. to what extent educators are aware of legislation pertaining to privacy and security requirements applicable to them

 

The interview questions would be surrounding those topics. Our end goal is to make schools safer for K-12 students, because they are one of the more vulnerable groups for data theft and inappropriate (unsafe) software usage in general. Please consider signing up for an interview if you are able, also feel free to pass this on to anyone who runs IT for your school -- we'd love the opportunity to interview them separately as well.



 Requirements:

1. You have taught in the US at any time in the last 5 years.

2. You have taught in either a public school, or a school that receives public funding (i.e. charter).

1. Basic shape/color/position stuff to get people thinking numerically
2. Variables, setup() and draw(), randomness, some input variables like mouseX and mouseY. Get things moving, or showing up at a random position each time you run the program. You can also do things like acceleration, colors changing over time, things that move with random x and y velocities, etc. The goal here is to get a good sense of the difference between keeping a value between frames, picking an entirely new value, modifying a previous value, etc. It's also useful to get a good sense of velocity vs. position, because that keeps coming up a lot when everything is so graphical.
3. Conditional statements. Start doing things like having an object loop around when it gets to the edge of the screen, clicking on targets, bouncing, etc. Get a good sense of variables changing at a specific time vs. continuously.
4. Loops for displaying many things in a single frame. Things like gradients, many-shape patterns, etc. Also use variables to make those patterns gradually change, etc.
5. Arrays. I present a specific procedure for going from ""do this with one variable"" to ""do this with many variables"".
6. Student-designed independent project.

I've done about that in a semester. It's pretty easy to expand the same material if you have more time by getting more practice, adding other useful programming patterns, getting different kinds of math in there (like getting towards ""this thing always moves straight towards the mouse at constant speed""), having more frequent independent projects, etc. The next programming tool I would add is classes. If you want to reduce the topics covered, just removing from the end is the way to go. I would always do at least one student-designed project, though, that's always the best part of CS classes.

If you want I can send you the set of problem sets that I did when doing this. I gave students a large number of options for problems, some much harder some much easier, and said ""to get full credit you need to do at least X points worth of problems"".",comment_5,r/CSEducation,Education,,https://www.reddit.com/r/CSEducation/comments/1jw41ul/introduction_for_high_school/
"I need help with my research Dear Teacher,
I am currently an undergraduate student at Hacettepe University, Faculty of Education, in Turkey, studying Computer Education and Instructional Technology. As part of a course called Comparative Education, we are asked to reach out to a teacher from a different country. The aim of this project is to gain insight into how a course in our field is taught in different educational systems.
I sincerely thank you in advance for accepting to participate in this short interview. Your responses will not only help me fulfill the requirements of my course but also contribute greatly to my professional development as a future educator.
Below are the questions I would like to ask:
What kind of educational background and training did you go through in order to become a teacher? What steps were involved in the process?
Could you please provide some information about the institution where you currently work? Is it a public or private school? What subjects do you teach and what age group are your students?
What are the main goals or objectives of the course you teach? Could you briefly mention a few of them?
What teaching methods or techniques do you use inside and outside the classroom?
Could you describe the scope and content of the course? What topics does it cover?
What types of materials or resources do you commonly use while teaching this course?
How do you encourage and ensure active student participation in your lessons?
How do you assess whether your students have achieved the course objectives? What is your approach to assessment and evaluation?
What assessment tools do you use during this process?
If you don’t mind, would it be possible to share a short video, a photo from one of your classes, or a visual of a material you use, so I may include it in a presentation for my course?
Finally, is there anything else you would like to share about your teaching experience or instructional approach?
Additionally, how would you describe the value placed on teachers and education in the country you live in? What impact has your educational background had on your career? In your opinion, what are the most rewarding and most challenging aspects of being a teacher in your country?
I truly appreciate your time and support, and I look forward to hearing your insights.
Kind regards,

"What Computer Science topic would you like broken down into a graphic? Hey everyone!

I've started a business to help spread high quality education for a fraction of what it costs at University. I plan on releasing courses that combine the benefits of online courses (practicality & cost) and University (Theory), and want to make it my goal to reduce the barrier into Computer Science.

At the moment I believe University is quite literally robbing thousands of dollars from everyone - and I believe the quality of this education has shot down. Yet - universities are still charging insane prices. I want to change this!

So I've come up with a idea - ask me to breakdown any topic you would like - in any part of Computer Science - and I will break it down into a simple, and pretty graphic. If you like it - you can stick around - if you don't that's okay!

I'm on this mission and am determined to make things right.

"The AI Hype: Why Developers Aren't Going Anywhere Lately, there's been a lot of fear-mongering about AI replacing programmers this year. The truth is, people like Sam Altman and others in this space need people to believe this narrative, so they start investing in and using AI, ultimately devaluing developers. It’s all marketing and the interests of big players.

A similar example is how everyone was pushed onto cloud providers, making developers forget how to host a static site on a cheap $5 VPS. They're deliberately pushing the vibe coding trend.

However, only those outside the IT industry will fall for this. Maybe for an average person, it sounds convincing, but anyone working on a real project understands that even the most advanced AI models today are at best junior-level coders. Building a program is an NP-complete problem, and in this regard, the human brain and genius are several orders of magnitude more efficient. A key factor is intuition, which subconsciously processes all possible development paths.

AI models also have fundamental architectural limitations such as context size, economic efficiency, creativity, and hallucinations. And as the saying goes, ""pick two out of four."" Until AI can comfortably work with a 10–20M token context (which may never happen with the current architecture), developers can enjoy their profession for at least 3–5 more years. Businesses that bet on AI too early will face losses in the next 2–3 years.

If a company thinks programmers are unnecessary, just ask them: ""Are you ready to ship AI-generated code directly to production?""

The recent layoffs in IT have nothing to do with AI. Many talk about mass firings, but no one mentions how many people were hired during the COVID and post-COVID boom. Those leaving now are often people who entered the field randomly. Yes, there are fewer projects overall, but the real reason is the global economic situation, and economies are cyclical.

I fell into the mental trap of this hysteria myself. Our brains are lazy, so I thought AI would write code for me. In the end, I wasted tons of time fixing and rewriting things manually. Eventually, I realized AI is just a powerful assistant, like IntelliSense in an IDE. It’s great for writing templates, quickly testing coding hypotheses, serving as a fast reference guide, and translating tex but not replacing real developers in near future.

PS When an AI PR is accepted into the Linux kernel, hope we all will be growing potatoes on own farms ;)",post,r/CSEducation,Education,29.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CSEducation/comments/1jnanho/the_ai_hype_why_developers_arent_going_anywhere/

"Well, that's tough to nail down because each program and course is different. Generally each class you take you should expect to pay $50-150 per textbook. You can often mitigate that cost by renting, borrowing, or finding online copies. You may also be asked to pay for a subscription to various online platforms that could be up to $10-30 per month.


Having a reliable PC (laptop) will be critical. I would opt not for a gaming laptop because they are large, lound in class, and don't always support things like virtualization or are optimized for other tech workloads. They also don't revel well since they are so large and usually don't have great battery life. You should aim for one that is snappy and reliable (something like a Dell XPS or adjacent). I also think a MacBook Air is a great choice.


But thankfully most of your CS program will likely not have many other costs. Teachers try to use open source when possible, and coding is largely low cost endeavor.

"Can I teach both AP CSP and AP CS A in one year? I teach AP CSP at an early college high school with motivated students, many of whom already have programming experience. Our counseling department only allows seniors and some juniors to take the class. I've quickly found that this material is easy for the students and last year (my first year offering it) we had pass rates wells beyond the international average on the exam. I feel like I'm constantly reviewing material that they already know. 

Do you think it is possible for me to teach the CSP curriculum 1st semester, and then teach CS A 2nd semester, with students having the opportunity to register and take both exams if they choose? I am considering this for next year. My school is committed to officially offering CSP, not CS A, because of the idea of bridging the gap for all students to take classes at our partner community college and opening doors for students who may not have any coding experience. But I'd still like to teach more advanced topics within the year so students can get more depth and take the second exam if they are motivated to do so. I'm just not sure this would be enough time for all of CS A? Are there any topics I could cut out without missing material for the exam?

For anyone who's taught one or both of these classes, do you think this combined curriculum pacing would be feasible? Do you think they'd be able to pass the CS A exam with this pacing?

Take a look at the colleges that your students are considering and see how they handle CSP vs CSA, and use those numbers to help drive any curriculum change.

It’s possible that the course you offer would be fairly in line with APCSP, but instead of then trying to jam CSA in there as well, you could just enhance your CSP course. Either by going further in depth or breadth.

It's a very good free online course with a big community (if you get stuck you can ask for help on discord and other places and people tend to respond quite quickly). It has an official certificate that should help show your experience if needed.

The other big advantage is CS50 has a version of their curriculum approved for AP CS Principles called CS50AP, so you could teach the same thing that you learned.

That said, imo the first 5ish ""weeks"" of CS50 are quite challenging and are not great for high schoolers new to programming, but if you teach a year or semester long intro class then I think CS50AP works well after that.

At the end of each course the students will have an opportunity to take the relevant CompTIA certification. I have taught CS now for 4 years and have included networking and security in my classes but only as a small portion of the class. We mostly focus on coding.

"Ideas for High School Intro to Prog (HTML & CSS) Teaching Style Hi all, I’m a high school computer science teacher. I’ve taught some introduction to programming (JavaScript) and AP CSP classes before, but I’m teaching a different introductory class that focuses on web page design.

The class is extremely small (less than 10 students) and the skills in the class vary. Some students have computer science and/or programming experience, and some don’t. Because of this, I’m looking for some ideas for creative and innovative ways to teach the curriculum. I don’t want to teach normally, since it doesn’t allow the students who have a strong foundation to learn at a more rapid pace, but I can’t speed up the content because I’ll leave the students who are new to this in the dust and confused.

If anyone has any ideas on ways I can enhance the learning experience for all students so everyone feels like they’re understanding the material, while also pushing themselves, I would be extremely grateful to you! In the past, I’ve done different levels of unit projects where students can choose a more challenging, or simpler, project to push or polish their coding skills.

"High school Computer science teacher I'm new to teaching and could use some advice. I have a degree in Computer Science and experience in IT support and cybersecurity, and I was recently hired to teach high school kids cybersecurity and IT in general . Also help them prepare for IT certifications . Most of the kids have very little knowledge about IT, so I'm trying to figure out the best way to approach this.

Initially, I thought about introducing some simple lab exercises on TryHackMe but I’ve realized I should probably start with IT fundamentals first. For now, my goal is to teach the basics, keep them engaged, and gradually build their knowledge.

How do you typically start with students this age? What strategies do you use to keep them busy and interested? Are there any beginner friendly curriculum or resources you’d recommend?

I’ve already registered as an instructor on TestOut, but I haven’t heard back yet. Any advice or tips would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!",post,r/CSEducation,Education,9.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CSEducation/comments/1i8af3r/high_school_computer_science_teacher/

"What kind of ""IT certifications"" are you aiming at? Is the course supposed to be vocational or academic?

Either way, in my experience students appreciate having little projects to do, and some opportunity to be creative in what they do. I've always had much better engagement when asking students to make something (website, game etc) rather than just grind through a series of exercises.

 Online Curriculum/Platforms: Are there any recommended online resources, platforms, or curriculum that you've found effective for these subjects?
Lectures vs. Hands-on Activities: What's the best balance between traditional lectures and hands-on activities? I'm working with limited resources (budget and equipment), so I'm trying to be creative.
Project-Based Learning: Has anyone had success with project-based learning in these areas? If so, what kinds of projects have worked well?

"JavaScript with begin ... end Hello community,

I run a small free JavaScript coding site for code newbies, CS teachers, schools, etc: [codeguppy.com](http://codeguppy.com)

What I've noticed is that most beginners have a hard time to properly open and close the { ... } for functions, code blocks, etc.

I was playing with the idea of introducing a simpler ""javascript"" to [codeguppy.com](http://codeguppy.com) \-- where basically the symbols {  } are replaced with begin ... end.

A simple pre-processor will replace begin ... end with the proper { ... } before sending the code to execution to the JavaScript engine.

**Looking forward to your feedback on this. Do you think this will make coding more approachable to beginners or will create confusion later on when they will have to remove the ""training wheels""?**

Please see below how a function will look like (converted from the Breakout project on the [codeguppy.com](http://codeguppy.com) site):

    function createBricks()
    begin
        let noBricks = Math.floor((width - brickSpace) / ( brickWidth + brickSpace ));
        let arBricks = [];
    
        for(let row = 0; row < 3; row++)
        begin    
            for(let col = 0; col < noBricks; col++ )
            begin
                let x = col * ( brickWidth + brickSpace ) + brickSpace;
                let y = row * (brickHeight + rowSpace) + rowSpace;
                
                let brick = { x : x, y : y };
                arBricks.push(brick);
            end
        end

"Guide Your Students Through Code with Code Playbacks I created a tool to guide students through code examples. It combines the best aspects of books, online tutorials, and videos. I call them ‘code playbacks’, and they allow an instructor to guide learners through a complete coding session, step by step, with explanations.

Here’s how it works:

\- It’s an open source VS Code extension called ‘storyteller’ (repo here: [https://github.com/markm208/storyteller](https://github.com/markm208/storyteller), more info here [https://markm208.github.io](https://markm208.github.io)).

\- Write code with VS Code, run it, refine it, and then go back and tell your story about it. Add whiteboard style drawings, screenshots, videos, and self-graded multiple choice questions.

\- The playbacks created by the tool are just static web pages that you can share anywhere.

[Example Code Playback](https://reddit.com/link/1i5bnuo/video/5bfh123f31ee1/player)

I have built most of my programming-focused courses around code playbacks. I don’t assign textbooks anymore. I present the playbacks during my lectures in class too. My students really like them.

Previously, I hosted all of my playbacks on a GitHub Pages site (this is a good option for most people). I wanted to add some more features to know who was viewing them and to add an AI assistant so I created a dedicated site to share my code playbacks, Playback Press ([https://playbackpress.com/books](https://playbackpress.com/books)). 

I’ve written about a dozen ‘books’ of code playbacks that are available for free (C/C++, Python, Clojure, Elixir, SQL, Web Dev, and more). Each playback on PP has a built-in AI assistant to answer student questions about the material and to generate multiple choice questions. Feel free to use these in your classes.

There is a login required to get full access to all of the playbacks and to use the AI assistant. I do have to pay for hosting and AI API access so I limit some features to logged in users. It may look like I am trying to sell something here, but I am not. It’s all free to use.

I’ve been thinking about exploring something new. With the rise of students using AI tools when learning, I think having students create their own playbacks to explain their work with an AI assistant could be a valuable part of the learning process. 

If this sounds interesting, or if you’d just like to try using playbacks in your classes, I’d love to connect. I’m happy to discuss potential collaborations.",post,r/CSEducation,Education,20.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CSEducation/comments/1i5bnuo/guide_your_students_through_code_with_code/

"How accurate is the American narrative of Bin Laden’s hatred for the US? I’m watching American Manhunter: Osama Bin Laden on Netflix. Honestly, I don’t know much about the events surrounding 9/11 other than the basics (I’m not sure why it never interested me but I’ve never dug deep). However, being Irish and learning about not just general propaganda but specific countries misleading their populations has me thinking: is there a debate on whether Bin Laden just straight up hated Americans because of their capitalism, gender equality, religious freedom, etc? Not trying to fight Bin Laden’s corner or anything, but I’m always curious about differing views.
Do we know what started his hatred for the US? Why did he target the US and not any other countries? Does it go back to his family history? The documentary series just seems to claim it came from nowhere, but I’d love to know if there’s some background info about what lead up to him despising this one country.

"My mother was in two Nazi slave labor camps from mid 1941 to April 1945 (Peenemunde and Mitte Dora). Here is some of her experience: she and some of her fellow former slaves scavenged food for several weeks and slept in the streets as the war came to an end. 

Eventually she was taken to a camp for refugees and because she was originally from Yugoslavia, she was deemed a Displaced Person and was assigned to a DP Camp. She was offered the opportunity to return to Yugoslavia but refused (her family had been killed during the Nazi occupation there and she was an orphan). She worked in the DP Camp and after two years or so (early 1948) was given the opportunity to emigrate to the US. 

So in May of 1948 she sailed into NYC, passed through Ellis Island, and began a new life with a family in New Jersey.

Hi there! While we wait for a Roman historian, I would like to point out that you've internalized some misinformation. Not one part of this is right. Not even a little bit. 

Obviously some very weird stuff happened in a continent over the course of 1,000 years, but as a general rule military equipment was not unaffordable, and it became more affordable as time went on and the European economy recovered from the post-Roman collapse. Basic weapons, like a spear and a shield, or a bow and a few arrows, were within the economic reach of many people. 

At no point was warfare dominated by levied serfs armed only with agricultural implements. Levied men were expected to equip themselves to a certain minimum standard, and those too poor to do so were not generally called up. Consequently, nearly all combatants had access to proper weapons of some kind, even if they lacked armor. If we look at the Assize of Arms of Henry II, we see different expectations for free men of different economic status. The poorest were to equip themselves as light archers, and the wealthiest peasants were to equip themselves as armored spearmen.

The Norse did not routinely fight with wood axes. Axeheads from fighting axes have been recovered by archaeologists, but so have swords and spearheads. If anything, spears were probably the more common weapon, as they were elsewhere in early medieval Europe.",comment_1,r/AskHistorians,Education,,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/1kujtie/how_was_it_possible_for_so_much_of_romes/
"There's a few misconceptions in your question. I'm just going to pick out two.


""Vikings specifically because most couldn’t afford a sword or spear so took the axe their family used for chopping wood.""

The most common weapon in use for vikings, and those they faced in combat was the spear. Viking axes, and those used by North Western Europeans were designed as weapons of war and were not agricultural implements.


""levies basically had to go in with leather and pointy stick""


Leather armour is mostly a fantasy, there is some speculation that North Western European soldiers may have worn boiled leather sculcaps, however none have been discovered and we have copius amounts of preserved leather items from Norse and Anglo-Saxon finds. Norse and Anglo-Saxon metal helmets are also a rarity, but this may be due to their value and repurposing/recycling. The Bayeux Tapestry for example depicts each warrior with a helmet.


We do have records from both Norse and Anglo-Saxon documents that all members of a fyrd and/or here must provide their own weapons and shield. IIRC the weapons listed were called ""folk weapons"" and included a spear, bow and arrows, or sword (seax?)


I'll stick to dealing with North East Europe here before the 12th century as that was my primary area of study (and 17th century), but my understanding is arms just became cheaper and easier to purchase as the era progressed.

"There was a status element to that rather than class. At least not in the modern understanding of class.      
In a European medieval society that was mostly divided between laboratores (those who work) bellatores (those who fight) and oratored (those who pray), being able to fight was a way to say ""I'm a free man"".       
      
The opportunity for loot was also an incentive. Like you said, serving as a soldier meant that you may get a share of the spoils. If you were lucky, you could even be part of some noticeable event and get yourself a gift from your lord. So it was a way for social advancement. Same thing if you were particularly tall or good looking, or had some kind of niche talent, some officer could decide to hand you a mission that would be safer and more rewarding than mere footsoldier.      
     
On the other hand, during certain periods like levees, serving as a soldier was part of the social contract between yourself and your lord. If some agent of your feudal lord came to your village or farm to ask for men to fight, you had to, and to avoid it you had to pay. Under late Merovingians and early Carolingians, it was between ⅓ and ¼ of your farmlands. Under mid or late middle ages, the price was more unified and you could also avoid paying if you found someone to fight in your name (and paid for their equipment the same way you would do for yourself)",comment_3,r/AskHistorians,Education,,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/1kujtie/how_was_it_possible_for_so_much_of_romes/
"Interesting! So I assume then, there is a cultural class element to this? Do we have any idea of how peasants viewed their duties toward war (doubtful but figured I’d ask)? Obviously being able to afford gear sets you aside socially from the “riff raff,” but what was the incentive here for peasants to regularly arm and fight for lords? Was there a lot of opportunity in warfare from spoils or the chance at land? The fear of social ostracization or perhaps an element of masculinity to push able bodied men to fight? 

I know that people always do things that are not necessarily in their best interest, that’s a tale as old as time, but I was always curious what the incentive for medieval western militaries was in an age prior to large standing militaries and nationalism.",comment_4,r/AskHistorians,Education,,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/1kujtie/how_was_it_possible_for_so_much_of_romes/

"Did Nazi paramilitary and SS rank titles sound strange, dramatic, or funny to Germans at the time? Note—not a native German speaker, or fluent aside from the military lingo I pick up from history books. 

Allowing for the martial lineage of terms such as *Sturm* predating the advent of the Third Reich (as with the WW1 Stoßtruppen), the one-to-one translation into English of SS and SA titles in particular has still always sounded a bit grandiose and dramatic to my ear—“senior storm leader”, “senior assault group leader,” particularly in the military context where the whole rank would have to be spelled out when addressing the holder. It strikes me as even more the case when the Nazi Party was still a relatively fringe organization, and evocative titles like Sturmführer or Sturmbannführer would have to be used “within the club” back when it was much less mainstream. 

Was there ever a perception of this amongst other Germans either before or after the Nazi seizure of power, where these martial titles and their connotations of elitism or military assaults provoked derision or eye rolls at the implied grandiosity and self-seriousness of it, rather than any kind of fear or respect? 

And when the Waffen-SS became into being, was standard practice to address these officers by their SS ranks or by their Army equivalents (I.e. Generalmajor, as in Generalmajor der Waffen-SS, instead of Brigadeführer)? Is there any record of Army soldiers viewing these parallel soldiers and their parallel titles with disdain or irony?

"Who was the first guitarist to distort their guitar, and why? How did the distorted guitar sound become ubiquitous in rock music?",post,r/AskHistorians,Education,64.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/1kukjyz/who_was_the_first_guitarist_to_distort_their/
"Distortion was originally a natural byproduct of the low-fidelity early amplifiers being pushed past their “safe” maximum volumes, or of those amps receiving more output gain from the instruments themselves than they could handle, producing clipping. As with all such innovations there is an accepted “legend” as to who was the “first,” but in reality most of the innovations made in this respect were largely concurrent and mutually influential. Western swing guitarists and Chicago blues sidemen were the first ones to experiment with *deliberately* dirtying up their sound in this way, and in the latter case mainly to provide a contrapuntal grittiness to the vocal style of singers like Muddy Waters. 

From there, a positive feedback loop emerged whereby a malfunctioning or damaged amp would produce a sound during, say, a recording session that would become a hit which caused the sound to be sought after by other players excited by the unique possibilities it offered—volume, sustain, aggression, attitude. As the language of the electric guitar developed around the blues grittiness and the jazzier, uptempo content of the Western swing players (in particular, Texas Playboys guitarist Junior Bernard), this sound became increasingly mainstreamed and a phrasing language of faster single note runs and bends evolved in response, which caused the sound to be more sought-out and pushed to bigger extremes. 

Simply put, the sound of a distorted guitar was aggressive and exciting, when coupled with the fast tempos and driving rhythms of what would become rock and roll—the melding of rhythm-and-blues and Western swing styles. This particular sound was probably most impactful on the first generation of British blues-rock players to hear the sounds from imported American rock n roll records during the postwar period, as many of these players were the ones who codified for once and for all time the ubiquity of pre-amp overdrive as the staple sound of rock music and heavy metal. Many of these guitarists, in particular Jeff Beck and Eric Clapton as well as the Rolling Stones’ guitarists, are on record describing how absolutely blown away they were by the loud, brash, assertiveness of this type of guitar playing—with Beck often waxing poetic about Blue Caps guitarist Cliff Gallup, who was also known for his use of “tape echo,” the “slapback” sound ubiquitous on rockabilly, Elvis, and Les Paul records (in fact, slapback tape echo is just as integral as distortion to the impact and excitement these sounds generated). So, one can easily see the through-line by examining these concurrent innovations influencing peers and following players. Aside from Chuck Berry and the like, a definitive early distortion sound can be found on Link Wray’s “Rumble”. 

By the time Beck, Clapton et al were hitting the scene (the mid sixties), engineers were inventing pre-amp devices to replicate deliberately what had been previously the source of things like damaging the amplifiers, like slashing the speaker cones (as with the Kinks) or leaving a vacuum tube partially out of the socket (how the sound on the original “Train Kept a Rollin” was produced—notably covered by Beck’s band the Yardbirds, which highly influenced Joe Perry of Aerosmith…and so on and so on—you see how this works by now).

By the time Hendrix capitalized on what the blues rock guitar heroes in Great Britain were codifying, and especially by the time the Yardbirds gave way to the Jeff Beck Group and Led Zeppelin, that distorted blues-based rock guitar was *the* sound. Much, much, much more can always be said, of course. But hopefully this was a useful crash course.",comment_1,r/AskHistorians,Education,,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/1kukjyz/who_was_the_first_guitarist_to_distort_their/

"Why did the Normans never 'Frenchify' the English population? It is not unheard of for small conquering elites to completely transform larger populations they conquered linguistically. Two examples that come to mind are the Arab conquests and the Magyars in Hungary. So why did the Normans not do this in England, and simply allowed the population to continue speaking English?",post,r/AskHistorians,Education,27.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/1kumx3w/why_did_the_normans_never_frenchify_the_english/
"The Normans were in reality a small force, only around 2000 moved to England permanently to rule over a population of possibly 1.5 million. Added to this, almost all of them were wealthy nobility/knights, who would interact rarely with native Anglo-Saxons. As a result, they needed a way to maintain control over a large population with very few resources. Since the Anglo-Saxons valued familial and community bonds, the Normans kept most of the justice system which relied and emphasised this. They made a few minor changes, increasing the role of the monarch and creating a more rigid social hierarchy with feudalism, but in truth, these probably wouldn't have impacted most of the population.

The cultural transfer was also limited as so many Anglo-Saxon lords were killed in the Battles of 1066 (Fulford Gate, Stamford Bridge and Hastings), there weren't many left to rub shoulders with the Normans.  Even after the Normans had conquered England, they spent as much of their time outside the country as in, with the Kings in particular spending large amounts of time in France and relatively little in England. It wasn't until the 14th Century that the King began to speak English as a primary language. English Kings claimed the French throne until the 19th Century, so the Frenchness of the Monarchy lasted a very long time.

However, they did actually Frenchify England quite significantly. First, the language of the Norman court was Old French, and a huge proportion of modern English is derived from French, often the posher words in English (ask vs enquire, ghost vs phantom, grave vs tomb), words to do with the running of the country (chancellor, parliament, baron) and foodstuffs (beef, pork, sausage). Many started naming their children with French name like William and Henry. Then we have castles which the Normans hugely expanded the use of in England and which are definitely French in origin, and the introductions of Knights. The Normans even introduced a new architectural style for Abbeys and Cathedrals.

In a way though, the sheer amount of time since the Conquest has caused the similarities to diverge again, likely hugely influenced by the French Revolution and later British moves towards Germany with the House of Hanover, and the huge rivalry with France during the 19th Century which pushed us further from any closer cultural ties.",comment_1,r/AskHistorians,Education,,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/1kumx3w/why_did_the_normans_never_frenchify_the_english/

"How did ""credit"" in early modern and medieval society actually work? How could banks in different cities or countries authenticate that an individual actually had the money they claimed to? For reference, I recently reread The Count of Monte Cristo, which got me thinking about this. I've heard a lot about how credit was hugely important in pre-modern societies, that very few to no people carried or did business in ""gold coins"" or physical currency, especially when dealing with large amounts.

But how did banks and other institutions authenticate a letter of credit? If I had a million francs in my Paris bank, then went and spent 500,000 in Rome, how does Paris know to ""update"" my balance? In general, how could a multinational banking system keep the finances of its many account holders consistent and well-tracked across different branches in different cities and countries before the invention of high-speed communication?

"First of all, unless he is referring to Soviet and German casualties, his math seems off. The Soviets suffered a bit less than half that amount of casualties between those dates, which is still, to be clear, astronomical, but not quite so as the bigger number. 

Antony Beevor goes into this in quite a bit of detail in what is essentially a pop-history work, “The Fall of Berlin,” written in 2003. He talks quite a lot about the systemic leadership and discipline problems which contributed to high casualties, as well as the immense competitive pressures Stalin placed on the commanders of the key Soviet front formations involved, Zhukov and Konev to break into Berlin, which led in particular to Zhukov’s issues in front of the final German defensive belt on the Seelow Heights. Considering the pop-history provenance of the book’s intended audience I’d say that’s pretty strong evidence that plenty of historians “talk about” the persistent leadership and tactical issues with the Red Army up until the war’s last days, and also contextualize these practices by talking about the authoritarian political culture of Stalinism and its generic lack of value for the lives of its soldiers—at least when compared with the United States and Great Britain, which as democracies were naturally far less tolerant of mass casualties.

"Why did Protestant denominations found so many universities in the US during the 19th century? I'm doing some research for a college paper and found out that Protestant religious groups founded several of the earliest universities in California (notably USC, Occidental, the school that eventually became UC Berkeley pre land grant, and probably some others that fell out of my brain between thinking about this and drafting a reddit post). I also know of several other mainstream/secular universities founded by mainline Protestant groups in other parts of the US in the same period, like Wesleyan, Emory, and Southern Methodist. 

What was the reason these schools were founded? Were they created as seminaries to generate ministers for these denominations, and then branched out to offer more fields of study and accept secular students? Was it done due to values held by these groups that promoted ideas about ""an educated populace"" being a general good? Or was it for some more tangential reason, like it being more efficient to start a university under the auspices of a church group, or something of that ilk?

Note that the reasons religious denominations founded American universities is not the subject of my college paper in any way (the paper is about California universities and postwar social change).

"Why was there successful industrialization without famines in Japan’s Meiji period? Meanwhile, the Soviets had to starve millions to death to achieve industrialization in the 1930s?",post,r/AskHistorians,Education,155.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/1ku30z7/why_was_there_successful_industrialization/
"First of all, this question is not framed very well because the Meiji period and the 1930s were fundamentally different, as are the predicaments facing the Soviet Union and Japan.

Industrialization requires technical know-how, machinery imports, and the means to purchase them. Unlike Meiji Japan, which was opening up to the West and enjoyed relatively easy access to Western expertise and imports, the Soviet Union was a pariah state that had difficulty in securing that kind of relationship with the West. The old model of exchange under Tsarist Russia, when Russia sold timber and grain to international markets for machinery and technology, financed by French credits, collapsed after peace with Germany in WWI. The new Soviet government lost the Tsarist overseas finance networks; Russian assets overseas were seized; and having repudiated Tsarist Russia's foreign debts, the Soviets were deemed a poor credit risk for Western businessmen. Rather than relying on painless foreign credits, industrialization had to be paid for with reserves of foreign currencies (exhausted by 1922), or by increasing exports of what the USSR produced (grain) to balance out the additional imports needed for industrialization.  


That's where international trade came in. Whereas the Tsarist Russia (and to some extent Japan) enjoyed relatively good terms of trade  (i.e. higher grain prices = more machinery bought per ton of grain sold), the same could not be said for the USSR. WWI encouraged a general trend of increased production, especially in grain, in countries that were not directly on the frontlines to compensate for decreased production in war-torn Europe. Fast forward to 1920s, economic recovery in Europe led to global overproduction of grain and steadily declining world grain prices from the mid-1920s. Then, the Great Depression struck and demand for grain (and prices) declined further and worsened the terms of trade for the Soviets (meaning the USSR had to export way more grain than Tsarist Russia to buy the same amount of machinery). The Great Depression also led to capital flight to the US and credit squeeze in Europe, limiting Soviet capacity for machinery imports further.   
  
All these also came at the time when the Soviets were introducing collectivisation that reduced agricultural output, as well as having a complex of natural problems (drought, livestock crisis in Central Asia) that led to a famine exacerbated by harsh grain requisitons based on wrong estimates, and poor management of supply systems (see Wheatcroft, ""Towards Explaining Soviet Famine of 1931-3""; and his numerous works with R.W. Davies on the topic. But please note that the famine is a very contentious topic and this is only one explanation). And after trying exports of other stuffs like oil, flax, butter, or eggs despite domestic shortage, the Soviets had two options: drastically slow down imports and the pace of industrialization, or push on and dump all the grain they can squeeze out of peasants on Western markets (at lower prices too) for every US Dollar they can get. They chose the latter. Herein lies the key difference with Japan: the Soviet experience was ***forced*** industrialization at all costs.

\[1/2\]",comment_1,r/AskHistorians,Education,,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/1ku30z7/why_was_there_successful_industrialization/
"Now why were they so desperate as to choose the latter? It's because of the recurring fear among Soviet leaders that the capitalist West would one day attack and crush socialism. The Soviet's first taste of the West was Allied intervention in the Russian Civil War, and throughout the 1920s and 1930s there had been several war scares in the USSR. The leadership was convinced that the USSR needed to urgently develop heavy & defense industry to prepare for this coming war (ironically, even before Hitler came to power). Thus you have Stalin in 1930 speaking of the following during a food crisis: 

>The quota for daily shipments (now) should be raised to 3–4 million poods at a minimum. Otherwise we risk being left without our new iron and steel and machine-building factories (Avtozavod, Cheliabzavod, etc.). Some clever people will come along and propose holding off on the shipments until the price of grain on the world markets rises “to its ceiling.” There are quite a few of these clever people in Trade. They ought to be horsewhipped, because they’re dragging us into a trap. In order to hold off, we must have hard currency reserves. But we don’t have them. In order to hold off, we would have to have a secure position on the international grain exchange. And we haven’t had any position at all for a long time there – we’ll only obtain it now if we can exploit conditions that have arisen at the present moment and are particularly favorable to us.  
  
In short, we must push grain exports furiously.

(As quoted in Sanchez-Sibony, Red Globalization, p.49)

In short, in that particular time frame, with those unfavourable international circumstances and domestic agricultural crisis, starvation was an almost unavoidable, if abnormal, price for industrialization, but only ***IF*** industrialization had to proceed at that pace. And Soviet leaders believed forced industrialization had to occur at that pace for national security.

Highly recommend Chapter 1 of Oscar Sanchez-Sibony's *Red Globalization* for further reading.

"How effective was Japan at establishing espionage networks/spies in the United States during World War 2? I am interested in Japanese efforts to spy on the United States. I am aware that there were several German spy networks operating in the US during the Second World War and the Allies' many networks across occupied Europe but to what extent did the Japanese manage to run spies of their own?

If there were spies, what motivated them to spy for Japan? What impact did they have?",post,r/AskHistorians,Education,5.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/1kuo9pd/how_effective_was_japan_at_establishing_espionage/
"Yes, there were Japanese spies in the US prior to World War II. All of them appear to have been  from the Japanese Navy, which had designated the US and the likely future enemy. (Or at least, the Japanese Army spy school in Nakano had none of its graduates sent to the USA, mostly they went to China and Southeast Asia.)

Japan had several disadvantages compared to other countries spying in the US, namely, there was nothing ideological that would make an American spy for the Japanese emperor. Conversely, the Soviets could find many Americans who loved communism to spy for them, and the Nazis had a large population of Germans who had moved to the US in the post WW1 timeframe who were enraptured by Naziism to utlilize. 

The Japanese Navy, therefore, in hiring spies, needed to pay them cash to spy. And it became clear to them that Americans and others that are spying for cash, tend to have lower motivation than Japanese. Furthermore, coin operated spies tend to have low morals and typically have other problems that limit their effectiveness. Therefore, as time went on, Japan tried using more of its own officers, with mixed success.

The most interesting and high paid spy for Japan was Frederick Rutland. An Englishman and hero pilot in World War I, he had been an advisor to the Japanese Navy in the 1920s before moving to Hollywood to spy for Japan in the Early 1930s. A larger than life figure, he fit his way into the British movie star crowd, attending parties with the likes of Charlie Chaplin as he grabbed technical info from Lockheed, Douglas and the like. Apparently, you can get a lot of good info from the manufacturers or the US Navy admirals if you are an English war hero who gets them drunk. His motivations appear complicated, but it seemed he just liked the money and ""being in the game."" 

The Japanese admirals noted that John Semer Farnsworth had gotten a lot of good information for them on things like dive bombing, where America led the world. He, like Rutland, was a genius at engineering. An Annapolis grad who attended MIT, he invented a rangefinder that increased the accuracy of Navy gunnery, but had been kicked out of the navy for all sorts of behavior not befitting an officer and gentleman, , including sleeping around, poor behavior when drunk, and ""borrowing"" money from subordinates. After being kicked out of the Navy, he needed money and thereby became a spy.

Some other Americans were hired by Japanese agents, but the Japanese quickly learned you could get some drunk ex sailor down by the docks on the payroll, but they weren't going to get much useful information.

Another intriguing spy was Shiho Sakanishi, a Japanese national woman who worked at the Library of Congress; she was more able to grab confidential info in Washington DC and could use library research as a cover for getting information from Americans, the Americans apparently trusted her more than an attache from the embassy. Accounts from the period mention her sleeping with Americans to get information, but that isn't something confirmed.

Other Japanese navy officers were spying in the USA, including Itaru Tachibana and Sadatomo Okada, with quite good success in some cases. Okada, based in Seattle, apparenlty grabbed the plans for a new super bomber from Boeing. Two other spy rings operated out of Mexico, including one led by Tsunezo Wachi, who was intercepting America Navy radio transmissions out of Virginia, he may have been a source for convoy information being given to the Germans.


Impact of these spies is a little hard to confirm, since Japanese records of the time were mostly burned. But it seems the impact in the development of Japanese planes was real and significant.

Japanese Americans were not used as spies by Japan. From the Japanese perspective, they  were  ""like Americans"" so the Japanese didn't trust them. Furthermore, there was a color line in US society, and an Asian face stuck out. Therefore, a Japanese American just couldn't operate effectively as a spy anyway.

"Were there specific cultural connotations to guitar playing in the Mid-Atlantic/New England area of America 1850s? Basically in the Herman Melville novel *Pierre* there is a character who owns a guitar of uncertain lineage (it's possible, but not certain, that it belonged to one of her parents, who were of very different status), and I'm just trying to figure out if there are any specific social/cultural implications to be drawn from guitar playing in that moment in time.

"How does the story of Nasala reflect the brutality of Belgian colonialism in Congo? Back when Belgium was bossing Congo around. This dude Nsala couldn't get enough rubber they wanted. It like 15 kilos or something. He went back and told the Belgian guy he couldn't do it but the Belgian and his buddies decided to punish Nsala.
They beat up his wife and his 5 year old daughter then they did some really bad stuff to them. After they ki11ed them, they threw their body parts at Nasala. They even ate what was left and fed some of it to guard dogs then Nsala died after 11 days later. from being so sad and messed up in the head but that picture he left? It still shows how bloody Belgium was in Congo.


It started way back February 5th, 1885. This Belgian King, Leopold II, he just took over Congo. he grabbed a huge chunk of Africa and forced the people to say it was his. They made them sign papers in German and French, languages they didn't even know so the Congo tribes basically signed away their land thinking they were just renting it out for farming and get this in just one year, Leopold II bought Congo from the people for like water, winter clothes, some honey. Then he took the rest of land. That's when their suffering started.
Leopold told his soldiers to kill and torture anyone who didn't do what they said. In just 22 years they killed over a million Congolese people and they chopped off the hands of another million.
After Leopold II died they called him 'King of Mercy' in Belgium. They thought he was one of the nicest kings in Europe but then in 2024 the Belgian people finally got it. They smashed his statues in Brussels to protest what he did in Africa

"There have been some more recent hypothesis, but the most sensational source, the one I suspect you are referring to, is [The Genetic Legacy of the Mongols](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12592608/) by Tatiana Zerjal et. al.

What they found was 8% of the population in a region stretching from the Urals, Kazakhnstan, and Turkmenistan, through much of northern China and into modern Russia bordering the Pacific, sharing descent from a single line that was possibly quite recent:

> We then used two approaches to calculate a TMRCA for the star-cluster chromosomes. The program BATWING (Wilson and Balding 1998) uses models of both mutation and population processes, which were specified as described elsewhere (Qamar et al. 2002). With this program, we estimated ∼1,000 years for the TMRCA (95% confidence interval limits ∼700–1,300 years). The use of alternative demographic models with constant or exponentially increasing population size changed the estimate by !10%. A method that does not consider population structure (Morral et al. 1994), r, suggested ∼860 (∼590–1,300) years.

This caused no small amount of stir at the time, after all, who else could it be?

There are a number of more recent studies. Of them, [this more recent study is available for free](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5839053/), and gives a good overview and puts a solid end to this claim in detail. The haplotype of a direct male-line descendant of Temujin, Batu-Mungke Dayan Khan, is known with reasonable confidence (C2c1a1a1-M407), and the line Zerjal's team found seems to be of Kazakh origin with more refined data.

">The haplotype of a direct male-line descendant of Temujin, Batu-Mungke Dayan Khan, is known with reasonable confidence...

Even if we have reasonable confidence in knowing Dayan Khan's haplotype, should we also have reasonable confidence that Dayan Khan's own direct-male-line descendedness - over a period of about three centuries separating the two men - is unimpeachable, that over maybe ten or twelve generations there were no cases of misattributed parentage?

(I agree with the overall point that at this point it is highly dubious to ascribe to Temujin the lineage identified by Zerjal et al. But such research is scrambled by misattributed parentage often enough in what were thought to be well-documented families - and in contexts rather less shot through with intrigue, conflict, and abduction than the Genghisid family tree. Doubts over whether every son Genghis claimed to be his, were actually his, were already being voiced in the first generation of his children; should we be confident in every paternity link over the next three hundred years?)",comment_3,r/AskHistorians,Education,,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/1ku25ix/how_did_they_actually_trace_genghis_khan_dna_back/

"From a previous [answer](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/m227lr/i_always_believed_the_soviet_union_fell_apart_due/gql70qm/) I wrote:

The referendum in question was held on March 17, 1991, and was worded as follows:

>Считаете ли Вы необходимым сохранение Союза Советских Социалистических Республик как обновлённой федерации равноправных суверенных республик, в которой будут в полной мере гарантироваться права и свободы человека любой национальности?

Which can be translated to English as:

>""Do you consider necessary the preservation of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics as a renewed federation of equal sovereign republics in which the rights and freedom of an individual of any ethnicity will be fully guaranteed?""

A couple things of note: the referendum was not held in six of the fifteen republics (Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, Moldova, Georgia and Armenia). All of these except Armenia had basically elected non-communist governments in republican elections the previous year, and Lithuania had even declared independence in March 1990. Latvia and Estonia held referenda endorsing independence two weeks before the Soviet referendum, and Georgia held a similar referendum two weeks after. So even holding the vote was a fractured, not Union-wide affair. 

It's also important to note the language of the referendum was for a *renewed federation of equal sovereign republics*. This may sound like a platitude, but effectively what it means is ""do you support President Gorbachev renegotiating a new union treaty to replace the 1922 USSR Treaty?"" 

The background here is that after the end of the Communist Party's Constitutional monopoly on power and subsequent republican elections in 1990, the Soviet Socialist Republics, even those controlled by the Communist Party cadres, began a so-called ""war of laws"" with the Soviet federal government, with almost all republics declaring ""sovereignty"". This was essentially a move not so much at complete independence but as part of a political bid to renegotiate powers between the center and the republics. 

Gorbachev in turn agreed to  this renegotiation, and began the so-called ""Novo-Ogaryovo Process"", whereby Soviet representatives and those of nine republics (ie, not the ones who boycotted the referendum) met from January to April 1991 to hash out a treaty for a new, more decentralized federation to replace the USSR (the proposed ""Union of Soviet Sovereign Republics"" is best understood as something that was kinda-sorta maybe like what the EU has become, in terms of it being a collection of sovereign states that had a common presidency, foreign policy and military). Even the passage of the referendum in the participating nine republics wasn't exactly an unqualified success: Russia and Ukraine saw more than a quarter of voters reject the proposal, and Ukraine explicitly added wording to the referendum within its borders that terms for the renegotiated treaty would be based on the Ukrainian Declaration of State Sovereignty, which stated that Ukrainian law could nullify Soviet law. 

That second question, presented to Ukrainian voters, was worded: 

>""Do you agree that Ukraine should be part of a Union of Soviet Sovereign States on the basis on the Declaration of State Sovereignty of Ukraine?""

And interestingly it got *more* yes votes than the first Union-wide question - the OP figures are actually for the second question, while the first question got 22,110,889 votes, or 71.48%.

In any event, the treaty was signed by the negotiating representatives on April 23, and went out to the participating republics for ratification (Ukraine's legislature refused to ratify), and a formal adoption ceremony for the new treaty was scheduled to take place on August 20. 

That never happened, because members of Gorbachev's own government launched a coup the previous day in order to prevent the implementation of the new treaty. The coup fizzled out after two days, but when Gorbachev returned to Moscow from house arrest in Crimea, he had severely diminished power, and Russian President Boris Yeltsin (who publicly resisted the coup plot) had vastly increased power, banning the Communist Party on Russian territory, confiscating its assets, and pushing Gorbachev to appoint Yeltsin picks for Soviet governmental positions.",comment_1,r/AskHistorians,Education,,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/1ktjpw3/why_did_the_ussr_collapse_under_gorbachev_even/
"As for the fate of the Union from there, some further edited info from a [previous answer](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/hfqun0/why_didnt_russia_annex_ethnic_russian_lands_from/fw03geh/) I wrote.

In 1990, during the so-called ""War of Laws"" between the republics and Gorbachev's Soviet center, Yeltsin was very much in favor of the republics exercising their sovereignty and working together as allies. However, once Yeltsin had maneuvered Gorbachev into the sidelines as the still-existing-but-ineffective Soviet President, he actually became the single most powerful political figure in the still-existing Union, and as such found a new love in keeping the Union together, in some form.

While in the immediate aftermath of the August 19-22 coup attempt against Gorbachev (and Yeltsin's ""counter-coup"" thereafter) Yeltsin was fine with publicly recognizing the independence of the Baltic states, the declarations of independence by other SSRs, led by Ukraine, were something of a shock to him and the Russian republican government: Ukraine's legislature voted for independence on August 24 (to be confirmed in a referendum scheduled for December), Belarus declared independence on the 25th, Moldova on the 26th, Azerbaijan on the 30th, Kyrgyzstan on Sept 1st, and Uzbekistan on the 2nd. The practical effect of these declarations was that, where the republics' declarations of ""sovereignty"" in 1990 prioritized republican law over union law, these declarations effectively nullified union law altogether.

A little more context for the August 24 vote. It was adopted by the Ukrainian Rada after a lengthy overnight session, 321 votes in favor out of 360 present. Most of the Rada members were Communist Party Members - in the previous year's legislative elections, the non-communist *Rukh* movement had won 111 seats out of 450 possible, with the majority going to Communist Party members (who later organized into a few different factions, but with the majority of deputies sticking with the Communist Party of Ukraine- CPU). What had changed though was the situation in Moscow - Yeltsin and the RSFSR government had closed the Central Committee of the CPSU and seized its assets, so what remained of the Union seemed to be at real risk of Russian republican takeover. The CPU was very concerned about this and saw independence (followed by a transfer of CPU assets to the Ukrainian state) as a pre-emptive measure to avoid greater control by Yeltsin. A National Guard was created, and the Rada passed a declaration stating that all Soviet military forces on the republic's territory were under its jurisdiction.

The Ukrainian declaration of independence was read aloud (in Russian) at an August 26 meeting of the Soviet parliament, and met with very hostile responses. Perhaps predictably, Gorbachev's face turned red and he stormed out. Yet more surprisingly, Russian democratic reformers rose to also speak out against republican independence. Anatolii Sobchak, the reformist mayor of St. Petersburg (and future mentor to Putin) denounced independence as a means to save ""national communist structures, but with a new face"", and worried about nuclear anarchy. Others spoke of the fear these independence declarations would do to democracy, and the possibility of border wars.

Yeltsin himself, via his press secretary Pavel Voshchanov, released a statement saying that if any republic breaks off Union relations with Russia, ""the RSFSR reserves the right to raise the question of the revision of boundaries."" When asked in a press conference if Yeltsin had particular boundaries in mind, Voshchanov stated those with Ukraine and Kazakhstan.

This statement received public support from Gorbachev (albeit mostly in an ""I told you so"" sort of way), and from figures such as Moscow mayor Gavril Popov, who feared Belarusian and Ukrainian independence would thwart democracy, and that at the very least referenda needed to be held in Crimea, Odessa and Transnistra over their joining the RSFSR.

Opposition to Yeltsin's statement was also immediate - a number of prominent Russian democratic activists released a statement (""We Welcome the Fall of the Empire"") supporting republican independence with no strings attached. Political figures in Moldova, Kazakhstan, and especially Ukraine were likewise quick to denounce Yeltsin's statement, with the Rukh movement in Ukraine going as far as calling it revived Russian imperialism. The Ukrainian parliament's presidium put out a statement noting that any territorial discussions had to proceed starting from a 1990 Russian-Ukrainian treaty recognizing the existing border between the republics.

Ultimately, this statement was more of a threat (or ultimately a bluff) rather than a serious territorial claim. When a Russian/all-Union delegation was dispatched to Kiev on August 28, their objective was to talk Ukraine down from outright independence, rather than press territorial claims. A member of Yeltsin's circle supposedly had even berated Voschanov: ""Do you think we need those territories? We need Nazarbayev [the soon-to-be president of Kazakhstan] and Kravchuk [the soon-to-be-president of Ukraine] to know their place!"" If the delegation's attempt was to convince Ukrainian politicians that they were one nation with Moscow, they seriously bungled the job, with Yeltsin's vice president Alexander Rutskoi, who even spoke Ukrainian, to ask them ""So, you khokhly have decided to separate, have you?"", using a very derogatory Russian term for Ukrainians. If that alone wasn't enough, the Ukrainian parliament issued decrees just before the delegation arrived guaranteeing rights to non-Ukrainian minorities, taking control of all military recruitment centers in the republic, and calling out Kievans to stand in front of the parliament building as the delegation from Moscow came for talks. After a night of prolonged negotiations, the Moscow delegation essentially backed down and left the Ukrainians with what they had. Nazarbayev immediately pushed for a similar deal, and the Moscow delegation flew directly from Kiev to Alma-ata, and signed a similar agreement. The delegation, and then Yeltsin personally, disavowed any knowledge or permission for Vorshchanov's statement, and then Yeltsin (from exhaustion) left on a two week vacation.

Anyway, to fast forward a bit - Ukraine finally held its referendum on the declaration of independence on December 1. The result was a profound shock to both Gorbachev and Yeltsin - 92% of voters supported independence in 84% turnout, and every region supported the measure with a majority of voters (albeit in Sevastopol it was 57% and in Crimea it was 54%).

When Yeltsin went to meet with Leonid Kravchuk, elected Ukrainian president the same day of the referendum, and Belarusian leader Stanislav Shushkevich at Belavezha, Yeltsin still had some hopes of salvaging a Union, but Kravchuk was uninterested - the Ukrainians wanted full independence, and Yeltsin was in turn not interested in a Union that didn't include Ukraine, as he feared such a union would give too much relative power to the barely-ex-communists in the Central Asian republics. The most that could be agreed upon in the Belavezha Accords was the formal dissolution of the USSR (on the premise that Ukraine, Belarus and Russia were the remaining founding republics of the 1922 union) and replacing it with the Commonwealth of Independent States, which 8 other republics formally endorsed in Alma-ata Kazakhstan in December 21. In both meetings, the republican officials affirmed the republican borders and refused recognition of any secessionist movements.
The authorities in Moscow until this time couldn't really settle on whether to try to keep slices of the Soviet pie for Russia, or just try to keep the whole pie under some sort of Moscow control. Ultimately, the republican leaderships, notably in Ukraine, left them with neither option.",comment_2,r/AskHistorians,Education,,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/1ktjpw3/why_did_the_ussr_collapse_under_gorbachev_even/

"Brian Mulroney, the prime minister of Canada, had attended the Ukrainian Canadian Congress of August ‘91 in Edmonton. He (allegedly, it’s not on record as far as I know) promised them that he’d recognize an independent Ukraine as soon as the referendum confirmed it. In September of that year, a Ukrainian delegation including Kravchuk visited Ottawa and Mulroney made the same promise to them; that delegation confirmed this promise to the aforementioned Congress. 

I can’t find contemporary records of these events, but 1991 issues of the Ukrainian Weekly, published by the Ukrainian National Association, mention Canadian-Ukrainian soft power. Canada planned for a consulate to open in Kiyv that summer; i don’t believe the building was staffed, but the foreign minister Joe Clarke appointed Nestor Gayowsky as consul. In October, Roy Romanow was elected Premier of Saskatchewan on a platform that included support for an independent Ukraine. 

Other politicians, such as Governor General Ray Hnatsyshyn were also involved in encouraging Ukrainian national organizations, particularly in relation to religion such as the rebuilding of the Ukrainian Autocephelus Orthodox Church.

"Can someone give me an idea of who would be part of a royal bride's entourage in the Middle Ages and early Renaissance in Europe? Who is likely to stay with her? Who's more likely to be sent home? Most of my research so far mentions specific people or just a ""large entourage"" with few details. And that many of the people escorting her eventually went home.

I know that by the Tudor era, there were some maids of honor, a duenna or governess, and confessor, for certain. I'm also guessing the entourage would include other attendants such as would make up a royal household. But that means a steward, master of horse and grooms, actual maids, pages, etc.

I'm sure the officials/officers like steward (and chamberlain?) would be replaced. But what about grooms, maids, etc? Master of the horse? Or would the entire household, barring a few maids of honor, pages (maybe), and perhaps her confessor, be replaced with people from her new home?",post,r/AskHistorians,Education,38.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/1ku4p5l/can_someone_give_me_an_idea_of_who_would_be_part/
"(1) I can't answer the question in a general way, but I can provide examples. Most of them show that husbands could and often did appoint their own people to their wives' household top offices (chancellors and administrators, porters and cupbearers, etc).

This was so because it was not uncommon that with a new queen, duchess or countess also came a myriad of unknown foreigners to the husband's court, and this could create a new influence bloc, especially if they were united around an ambitious wife. When Sibila de Fortià, daughter of a baron from Empúries, married King Peter the Cerimonious of Aragon, she brought with her dozens of knights and barons from her home area, people that, despite speaking the same language and sharing customs and culture with much of the court of King Peter, were seen as a unified bloc of foreigner inlfuence, and soon enough most of the kingdom's top posts, not just Sibila's household, were occupied by emporitan knights at the bequest of Queen Sibila.

Take the household of Eleanor of Aquitaine, who's described as taking active roles in the policy decisions and councils of her husband's advisors during her French period. When away with Henry II or during her Crusade with king Louis, she is described as being surrounded by a smaller entourage resembling her husband's military command. The top jobs of her household in the time of Henry II were Henry's own picks, underscoring that a husband had great inlfuence in his wife's household, but much of the mid-level or the most intimate posts were held by Potevins (chaplain, butler, chamberlain...)

In the 14th Century, several legal or ceremonial codes expose the supposed role and form of the Queen's household, largely as a feminine, protective “bed-chamber” focused on guarding her honour and purity. Male officers (mayordomo, chancellor, chaplains, scribes) are mentioned only in passing in the *Siete Partidas* of Alfonso X, and a series of royal officials are supposed to oversee the Queen's financial and political duties, but the reality of the situation, which we can see in the numerous donations and grants she made to named individiuals and the titles they hold in these documents (in the cases of Jeanne of Ponthieu and Violant of Aragon), reveal that the Queen's household also had plenty of men working in it, and that these queens used their funds (either from personal wealth or from the repartimentos she had recieved from their husbands, carved out of the Reconquista gains in Andalusia) to create a network of patronage and influence (parallel or opposite to their husband's, depending on your view).

In the case of Jeanne of Ponthieu, we can see that she gave lands and income to people both from her general area of origin, as well as local Castillian noblemen, although almost all of the top jobs in her household were held by Castillians. Her household was listed as 45 people, all Spaniards, but the list seems incomplete, since it includes no women, no maids or ladies-in-waiting, and no mayordomo. It could be that those were the ones who were foreigners. We can infer that she brought with her a majority of her house staff, maids and servants, but that the most presigious positions (cupbearers -essentially wine provisioners-, cook, acemilero -literally mule-driver, but more of a travel planner-, portero -boduguard-, toquero -headdress keeper-, chancellor and chaplains -two of them) were all Spaniards of generally lordly or hidalgo condition.",comment_1,r/AskHistorians,Education,,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/1ku4p5l/can_someone_give_me_an_idea_of_who_would_be_part/
"(2) Violant of Aragon recieved three villages and their lands to use as grants for her household members, and 78 of those were beneficiaries of these grants (of which 76% are men) - mind you, these are the ones who got grants, not the totality of her household. Again we see that the mayordomo, cupearer, acemilero, repostero (baker), porters, tailor, alcaide (judge or lawyer), scribe head and confessor are all Castillians - Evelen ladies-in-waiting are mostly Castillian, but most of the maids have Catalan names or seem to come from Catalan families judging by their surnames, so we can deduce that she did bring most of this mid-level staff with her - meanwhile, the servants are mostly drawn from the local population; not much is said about them in these documents. Sometimes some people are also present in the lists of royal or infante household members, so there seems to have been some permeability or even double roles in the Castillian court. One interesting detail about Violant is that she married very young, and she travelled to Castille accompanied by her preceptor (male, not female) Jofré de Loaysa and his wife Jaumeta or Jacometa. Both of them remained in service of Violant for decades afterwards.

Philippa of Lancaster, queen of Portugal, also had a sizeable household (and an illustrious reputation). We can see in King Joao's Chronicle that she recieved from her husband the King a household and the means to maintain it just after their wedding, and we are told that it fed from the dowers (arras) the king granted her, of its composition: the married women or dames (donhas), among them Beatriz de Castro -wife of the lord of Castro and one of the highest ranking women in court-, the main lady-in-waiting Beatriz Gonçalves de Moura -a widow and preceptor of Philippa in the language and customs of Portugal-, Teresa Vasques Coutinha, her head chambermaid.  Some of these ladies were related, mothers and daughters and sisters.

Then there's the *donzelas*, or maidens, still single, of high birth but most of them orphans of father. They could be struggling financially in some way, and the Queen would have to work her influence to arrange good marriages for them. Essentially the Queen's household was a sort of social care for unmarried ladies of high birth but probably not stellar means.

None of them are English, and neither are the male members of the household: the mordomo-mor (administrator of her domain) was Don Lopo Dias de Sousa, master of the Military Order of Christ -the successors of the Templars in Portugal-, her treasurer was Lourenço Eanes Fogaça, previously the King's chancellor, and her head-butler was the abbot Afonso Martins, among others. She seems to have preserved two English attendants: her confessor Adam Davenport, lawyer and rector in Norwich, and Thomas Payn, Philippa's personal secretary. Later on, she would add to her court two more English men, a cook and a tailor, both called Richard.

Some of the squires who were in her household and were sworn to protect her were English (at least half), and during her queenship English courtiers pop up constantly, but were they invited later by the Queen, sent by her family to help or to accrue influence, or were they there from the beginning, just going unmentioned in the Chronicle? We don't know.

So, all in all, it seems it was rather uncommon that she'd keep a large amount of her original household, probably because the husband preferred to maintain a staff of people that he knew, that he trusted, or simply to reward people that he felt deserved to be paid for their services, and the Lady's household was just another collection of offices with which to reward his *fideles*. That doesn't mean that a wilful lady with a grip on her husband couldn't manage to turn the tables around, like in the case of Sibila de Fortià.",comment_2,r/AskHistorians,Education,,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/1ku4p5l/can_someone_give_me_an_idea_of_who_would_be_part/

"In Robert Graves's novel ""Claudius the God"" the eponymous narrator refers to the God of the Jewish people as the strangest God he's ever heard of. Did Roman people actually believe, having encountered so many foreign faiths, that Judaism was particularly unusual? If so, why? A modern layman's understanding of the ancient world (such as mine) suggests several reasons why this is probable: 

1) The Jewish God of the first centuries BCE and CE was the exclusive subject of worship for most jewish believers (I don't know how many ""hellenized"" Jews remained in the Medditerannean after the Maccabean Revolt in the 2nd century BCE, but I'm assuming they were marginal at best)

2) Jewish cosmology denied the very existence of other deities (I'm aware that scholars generally believe that ancient Jews first worshipped YHWH *over* other powerful supernatural figures they believed existed, but my understanding is that by the time of Emperor Claudius this intense monotheism was well established in Jewish theology) 

3) Jewish religious law forbade idol worship 

4) Jewish theology suggested a less transactional relationship between believer and deity than more widespread ancient polytheistic faiths 

5) Jewish religious law imposed unusual dietary restrictions among the faithful 



I do not know the extent to which these claims/comparisons were true in the lifetime of the emperor Claudius, nor do I know if any of these claims, if true, would make Jewish people seem unusual to a roman emperor. But what do Roman sources, before the rapid rise of Christianity in the empire, say?",post,r/AskHistorians,Education,443.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/1ktmj8a/in_robert_gravess_novel_claudius_the_god_the/
"***I'll say at the outset that perceptions of Jews in Ancient Rome are expansive and could be treated more widely than I will. This includes the fact that Roman Alexandria was the first instance of a pogrom, which happened in 38 CE, and that this antisemitism influenced our current antisemitism today. However, this question specifically asks about perceptions of strangeness, so I will focus on one specific source that explores this question.***

I'd first want to say to think of perceptions of people of different religions in your own time and place: Romans, like people everywhere, had different opinions. So one Roman may have seen them as exceedingly strange, another may have thought them to very normal (and respectable). Perhaps they may have argued about it over dinner: and while we can't be a fly on the wall to overhear such a conversation exactly, Plutarch offers us a literary example in his Moralia. Let's listen in, shall we?

During the fourth question, on whether food from the land or sea is better, we get our first reference to Jewish custom. Lamprias says:

>My grandfather used to say on every occasion, in derision of the Jews, that what they abstained from was precisely the most legitimate meat. But we shall say that of all delicacies the most legitimate kind is that from the sea.

Lamprias continues arguing that surf is better than turf, but Lamprias' reference to the Jews sparks the fifth question:

>When he had finished, and some of those present would have made an extended reply to his arguments, Callistratus headed them off by saying, “What do you think of the assertion that it is precisely the most proper type of meat that the Jews avoid eating?” “I heartily agree with it,” replied Polycrates, “but I have another question: do they abstain from eating pork by reason of some special respect for hogs or from abhorrence of the creature? Their own accounts sound like pure myth, but perhaps they have some serious reasons which they do not publish.”

“My impression,” said Callistratus, “is that the beast enjoys a certain respect among that folka; granted that he is ugly and dirty, still he is no more absurd in appearance or crude in disposition than dung-beetle, field-mouse, crocodile, or cat, each of which is treated as sacred by a different group of Egyptian priests. They say, however, that the pig is honoured for a good reason: according to the story, it was the first to cut the soil with its projecting snout, thus producing a furrow and teaching man the function of a ploughshare. Incidentally, this is the origin, they say, of the word hynis (from hys, ‘swine’) for that implement. The Egyptians who cultivate the soft soil of their low-lying areas have no use for ploughing at all. After the Nile overflows and soaks their acres, they follow the receding water and unload the pigs, which by trampling and rooting quickly turn over the deep soil and cover the seed. We need not be surprised if some people do not eat pork for this reason. Other animals receive even greater honours among the barbarians for slight and in some cases utterly ridiculous reasons.

He goes on to describe Egyptian deification of mice, lions, and ibises. He continues:

>How could anyone blame the Egyptians for such irrationality when it is recorded that the Pythagoreans respect even a white cock, and that they abstain particularly from the red mullet and the sea anemone among marine animals? Or when we remember that the Magi, followers of Zoroaster, especially esteem the hedgehog and abominate water mice, regarding the person who kills the greatest number of the latter as blest and dear to the gods? So I think the Jews would kill pigs if they hated them, as the Magi kill water mice; but in fact it is just as unlawful for Jews to destroy pigs as to eat them.

"Why? Well Tactius hated Jewish people, and hatred, as Jessica Lopez demonstrates in Mean Girls,^(1) is a bit of a chicken and egg situation. Does someone notice something about someone and dislike it because they dislike the person, or do they notice something they dislike about a person and dislike the person afterwards?

I think that's worth keeping in mind when one reads Tactius' descriptions of *why* Jewish people are strange (ibid):

>Whatever their origin, these rites are maintained by their antiquity: the other customs of the Jews are base and abominable, and owe their persistence to their depravity. For the worst rascals among other peoples, renouncing their ancestral religions, always kept sending tribute and contributions to Jerusalem, thereby increasing the wealth of the Jews; again, the Jews are extremely loyal toward one another, and always ready to show compassion, but toward every other people they feel only hate and enmity. They sit apart at meals, and they sleep apart, and although as a race, they are prone to lust, they abstain from intercourse with foreign women; yet among themselves nothing is unlawful. They adopted circumcision to distinguish themselves from other peoples by this difference. Those who are converted to their ways follow the same practice, and the earliest lesson they receive is to despise the gods, to disown their country, and to regard their parents, children, and brothers as of little account.

I hope this helps answer your question, I'll end saying that I've focused on specific perceptions of otherness, not the broader relationships between Jews and non-Jews. Those relationships, as I said at the beginning, did also provide the origins of the antisemitism we know today, so those are well worth investigating as well. A good book I'd recommend for the evolution of antisemitism in Antiquity to today is David Nirenberg's *Anti-Judaism: The Western Tradition*, although I regret to say I can't think of a book that focuses specifically on the Roman perspective of the Jews.

"Lamprias counters: he does not think that Jewish people respect the pig:

>“The Jews apparently abominate pork because barbarians especially abhor skin diseases like lepraa and white scale, and believe that human beings are ravaged by such maladies through contagion. Now we observe that every pig is covered on the under side by lepra and scaly eruptions, which, if there is general weakness and emaciation,b are thought to spread rapidly over the body. What is more, the the very filthiness of their habits produces an inferior quality of meat. We observe no other creature so fond of mud and of dirty, unclean places, if we leave out of account those animals that have their origin and natural habitat there.

Moeragenes then argues that the god of the Jews is Dionysus:

>“First,” he said, “the time and character of the greatest, most sacred holiday of the Jews clearly befit Dionysus. When they celebrate their so-called Fast, at the height of the vintage, they set out tables of all sorts of fruit under tents and huts plaited for the most part of vines and ivy. They call the first of the two days Tabernacles. A few days later they celebrate another festival, this time identified with Bacchus not through obscure hints but plainly called by his name, a festival that is a sort of ‘Procession of Branches’ or ‘Thyrsus Procession,’ in which they enter the temple each carrying a thyrsus. What they do after entering we do not know, but it is probable that the rite is a Bacchic revelry, for in fact they use little trumpets to invoke their god as do the Argives at their Dionysia. Others of them advance playing harps; these players are called in their language Levites, either from Lysios (Releaser) or, better, from Evius (God of the Cry).

>“I believe that even the feast of the Sabbath is not completely unrelated to Dionysus. Many even now call the Bacchants Sabi and utter that cry when celebrating the god. Testimony to this can be found in Demosthenes and Menander. You would not be far off the track if you attributed the use of this name Sabi to the strange excitement (sobesis) that possesses the celebrants. The Jews themselves testify to a connection with Dionysus when they keep the Sabbath by inviting each other to drink and to enjoy wine; when more important business interferes with this custom, they regularly take at least a sip of neat wine. Now thus far one might call the argument only probable; but the opposition is quite demolished, in the first place by the High Priest, who leads the procession at their festival wearing a mitre and clad in a gold-embroidered fawnskin, a robe reaching to the ankles, and buskins, with many bells attached to his clothes and ringing below him as he walks. All this corresponds to our custom. In the second place, they also have noise as an element in their nocturnal festivals, and call the nurses of the god ‘bronze rattlers.’ The carved thyrsus in the relief on the pediment of the Temple and the drums (provide other parallels). All this surely befits (they might say) no divinity but Dionysus.

The dialogue continued when Plutarch wrote it, but unfortunately what follows was lost.

"So what can we see about *these* Romans?

Do they think that the Jews are unusual? Yes, otherwise they wouldn't be discussing them. But in what way do they think they are unusual? 

Well, first and foremost that they disagree amongst each other. So the view is multifaceted. 

Unfortunately we are missing the rest of Question 6, in which someone may likely have spoken up to disagree with Moeragenes about the god of the Jews being Dionysus. But from what survives we can see that they are seen as similar to other 'out-groups', both foreigners like Egyptians and followers of ideologies like Zoroastrianism and Pythagoreanism. Greco-Roman literature has a long history of 'observing the other', which often tells us more about the observer than the observed. But here we can see how this worked:

Lamprias, whose grandfather disparaged Jewish dietary laws, himself seems to find the ban on pork rational, as the animal is unclean. I left out a jibe made by Symmachus at Lamprias:

>“Lamprias, are you enrolling your national god in the calendar of the Hebrews and insinuating into their secret rites ‘him of the orgiastic cry, exciter of women, Dionysus, glorified with mad honours’?”

Lamprias, a Boeotian, would have had Dionysus as his 'national god'. And we can see Moeragenes making the case to back up Lamprias. So here we can see a range in views: Callistratus sees them as foreign, but perhaps not more ridiculous than the Egyptians. Lamprias and Moeragenes seem to esteem them as followers of Dionysus who follow rational dietary laws and similar religious traditions, however it is likely someone else may have been about to chime in to voice disagreement.

Let's invite Tacitus (who predates Plutarch) to this dinner party, because we know he would disagree. Here is his Histories 5.5:

>The Egyptians worship many animals and monstrous images; the Jews conceive of one god only, and that with the mind alone: they regard as impious those who make from perishable materials representations of gods in man’s image; that supreme and eternal being is to them incapable of representation and without end. Therefore they set up no statues in their cities, still less in their temples; this flattery is not paid their kings, nor this honour given to the Caesars. **But since their priests used to chant to the accompaniment of pipes and cymbals and to wear garlands of ivy, and because a golden vine was found in their temple, some have thought that they were devotees of Father Liber, the conqueror of the East, in spite of the incongruity of their customs. For Liber established festive rites of a joyous nature, while the ways of the Jews are preposterous and mean.**

Liber is Dionysus, so certainly not everyone agreed that the Jews honoured Dionysus. With Tacitus we also can see evidence for such a claim as is your original question: Tacitus certainly thinks the Jews are particularly unusual out of the other foreign nations.

"The reasons behind it lie in the secret Treaty of London Italy signed: in it, in exchange for partecipating in the war, the Entente promised Italy all Austro-Hungarian territories that composed *Italia Irredenta* (basically, places where there existed a significant Italian-speaking population), which notably did not include Bozen-- which was granted solely because ambassadors Sidney Sonnino and Vittorio Emanuele Orlando managed to convince the Entente that owning it was necessary for national security-- and Fiume-- which was not included because the expectations was that A-H was going to survive the war and in need of a port-- and, more pertinently, no new colonies.

While there do exist maps out there claiming the Entente had promised Italy new colonies (Italian Togo seems to be an especially popular idea), I cannot find any sources saying this was ever seriously considered. The impression I get is that it's either speculation, or a proposal that was soon discarded because the Italian government of the time was more interested in the project of owning all major Italian-speaking lands left (Nice was too small to be worth it, Corsica had been sold by the Republic of Genoa), than in expanding a colonial empire that was doing fine for the purpose of both prestige and as immigration re-router.

"Drying or salting.

That's why rocky beaches called ""graves"" in French, or ""gallays"" in older French, were so crucial to the fishing merchants in Saint-Pierre and Miquelon where the fish was dried during the fishing season before being shipped back to France or Spain. Not a single foot of good coastline wasn't used. In fact, it was a race every spring, the first Fishing Merchant who made it to the island became the default Harbour Admiral and would decide who got which beach.

In the 19th and the early 20th century, the merchants employed very young boys from impoverished Brittany to spend the days turning over the codfish as it dried on the rocky beaches.

"How much evidence is there that McClellan’s hesitation during the American Civil War was out of sympathy to the CSA? I know the official narrative is that McClellan was a famous perfectionist or disabled by indecision but what evidence is there that he was motivated by sympathy with the CSA cause? His main plank of the 1864 presidential campaign was one of “this isn’t something we should be dealing with” and coming to the negotiating table to end the war. He also maintained some cultural ties to the South through West Point and it seems plausible that he was at the least hesitant to draw arms against fellow Americans. How much of the narrative around his failures of immediacy are incorrect and more likely explained by personal affectations towards the CSA, if at all?",post,r/AskHistorians,Education,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/1kuo5au/how_much_evidence_is_there_that_mcclellans/
"There's been an enormous amount written about McClellan, and various explanations proposed for his ability to organize an army, but inability to wage an offensive or understand and react to the movements of an opposing army. In decades of very intense scholarship, no one has suggested that he was actually in sympathy with the CSA. I mean, if such a claim could be substantiated, it would be enormously significant- everyone would have to talk about it, address it. 

 James McPherson has suggested that McClellan and the earlier generals like Pope and McDowell focused on securing rebel territory and not attacking the Confederate army because they anticipated there would be some sort of negotiated settlement. If they looked at what had happened in the previous forty years, they'd have good reason to expect that: since the Missouri Compromise, the Southern states had repeatedly used threats of secession and violence to expand slavery and rights of slaveowners in the US, and with great success. A few years earlier, the Supreme Court had, with the Dredd Scott decision, extended those rights into every state in the Union. Pope, McDowell, and McClellan had good reason to hope that there'd soon be yet another agreement that would end the war; why not avoid bloodshed? 

Ethan Rafuse's biography of McClellan goes along with that.  McClellan was a Whig, who felt that slavery was something to be decided by each state; he would have been quite happy with such a compromise; as would perhaps the majority of the US voters. Rafuse also suggests that McClellan's training at West Point gave him a  bias towards tactical maneuvering, engineering and defense.

"Did any units of the French Army have any loyalties or strong feelings for Napoleon II? The reason I ask this is because I read An Army at Dawn by Rick Atkinson, and in the chapter Landing, in the subsection To the Last Man, it talks about how at Sidi Ferruch in 1830, a French army claimed Algeria for Naploeon II. I looked at the notes section in the back, and he had no sources on this.

"How was whale hunting possible before modern boats? I just can't figure out how whale hunting could be a possible thing with the technology from, lets say, the X century. How did they maneuver the boats fast enough to catch and countermaneuver a whale? For this you would need a small boat. How did they drag the dead wale to the coast then? How did they shoot the harpoons?",post,r/AskHistorians,Education,2.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/1kug5ws/how_was_whale_hunting_possible_before_modern_boats/
"Lot's of good answers in this [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/197faj/how_did_prehistoric_peoples_hunt_whales/). Which includes a nice video from BBC's Human Planet showing how people in indonesia still hunt using ancient methods today.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwioqBwz7o8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwioqBwz7o8)

To expand on this answer, I'll offer a bit more explanation as to the physics of the process in regards to your questions.

1. How did they maneuver fast enough to catch a whale?
2. How did they tow it?
3. How did they shoot harpoons?

You don't need to be fast, whales often come up for air, you can see that today as whales breach near shipping vessels or whale watching trips. Once someone from the community spots a group of migrating whales off the coast, the hunting ships (usually a wood canoe 7-10 meters in length capable of holding 10-14 people) were launched and sailed to the area of breaching whales. The hunters were armed with hand thrown harpoons.

Once at the location, the harpoons, attached to ropes, were thrown in an attempt to ""stick"" the whale, which will cause the whale to want to dive down to avoid attacks from above. You may have sometimes heard of a ""Nantucket sleigh ride"" in whaling history refers to the harpooning of a whale and the subsequent dangerous and exciting chase as the whale, in pain, pulls the whaleboat away at high speed.

However, diving down with a harpoon attached to a buoyant wooden canoe would be akin to a human trying to swim to the bottom of a pool while attached to a life preserver with a rope. While possible, it's an exhausting effort, and at some point you will need to again come back up for air. As the whale breaches again to get air, more spears are thrown, making it harder and more exhausting for the whale to swim. After many hours, the whale has exhausted itself and lost blood.

At this point the canoes are towing a heavy \*but buoyant\* whale. Whales are covered in blubber, and will float naturally. The effort required to tow a buoyant cargo back to shore is much less that towing an anchor or rock.

TL:DR Whale spotters > launch many canoes > spear the whale with roped harpoons > let the whale exhaust itself > tow back to shore.

Note, this same hunting method is similar to hunting mammoths or other big game. The goal is generally not to outright kill the animal, but to exhaust it.

"Articulate does not care about its users I've been using Storyline 360 for years now, and other than the useless AI assistant thing and a lot of toys, they really aren't doing anything to try and improve it. This morning I've just been frustrated as usual and finally decided to rant here.

The worst thing is the aggravating silence from Articulate about these kinds of things. It's crazy-making to bang up against frustrations constantly and know there's no one who will listen. Instead they throw us baubles we don't need and announce them with childish graphics and lots and lots of exclamation marks. Localization? AI? Morphing? We've got real work to do, Articulate. Why not work at justifying your exorbitant price and make your product better instead of adding bloat?

Here are a few daily frustrations that seem like they would be low-hanging fruit but which remain untouched year after year. These are off the top of my head as I type real-time.

MOTION PATH NAMES

When creating a new motion path, it is given a default name like ""Line Motion Path 1"". However, THE NAME IS TOO BIG TO READ IN THE NAME FIELD! All you can see is ""Line Motion Pat"", which means you are required to manually give each motion path a name, not because you need to, but because all the names look the same if you don't. I mean... people... MAKE THE FIELD BIGGER or else MAKE THE DEFAULT SHORTER. Problem solved. For crying out loud.

https://preview.redd.it/4zhcgjop1k2f1.png?width=333&format=png&auto=webp&s=acdb47ccb6e09b2b488fb39c66472ab584c44011

Also, a trigger is automatically created when you make a motion path that assumes you want the object to move at the start of the slide. Why do they assume that? So every time I make a motion path I need to first go in and change the name so I can read it in the field, and then I have to hunt down and delete the trigger it made.

I won't even get into the lack of ability to see motion paths in a list, or the requirement that you can only delete them by clicking on one of its tiny spots at either end. Which gets me to...

OBJECT SELECTION

IDs who use SL all day have just become used to how difficult it can be to select just the object you want on a slide. It's a constant frustration and waste of time. How about a simple frame around objects when hovering, with a text box indicating the name of the object you're just about to click on? This click-move-ctrlZ-click again-move again-ctrlZ over and over gets really old and should be unnecessary because there are multiple ways you could build the functionality better.

WIRELESS POINTER SUPPORT

Instructors leading a course written in Storyline want to use a wireless pointer mouse while they're up there lecturing. Those devices have buttons for mouse clicks. But you can't design a Storyline project to advance on mouse clicks. You can't tell Storyline ""This is an instructor-led course and they don't want to be pointing their mouse pointer thing at a little button. They just want to click to advance. You know, like PowerPoint."" I can program my project to do it myself, but it makes everything else take way longer to develop.

GROUP STATES

Groups can't have states. They are design time conveniences only. If I've built a nice box with a few images and some text boxes and a button in it, I'll save it as a group so I can move it around. But I CAN'T write a trigger to display and hide the group. OBVIOUS NEED. So I need to put it in its own layer. Which makes everything else in my slide more complicated now. Especially if I want to use a mouse click to advance the slide.

TIMELINE CONTROL

I don't have any control over the base layer timeline from a layer. So in the above example, I had to add my fancy box group to it's own layer so I could display and hide it. But if that fancy box has any interaction in it, I can't create triggers to do anything to the base timeline because now I'm in a layer. Which Storyline forced me to use in the first place because I can't have states on groups.

CUE POINTS

There is no option to move cue points when dragging objects in the timeline. I can't select multiple cue points at once, which means to move them means doing so one by one. I can't see a list of cue points in a dialog box. I can sometimes delete a single cue point, but I don't know when that option is available. By right-clicking on a cue point, I usually am only given the option to delete All cue points. But sometimes I will see the option to delete the one I'm clicking on. I don't know when or why.

AI ASSISTANT

I don't want or need this. My company would never permit it. So we don't own it and never will. But there it sits, taking up valuable ribbon space at all times, basically a BIG AD on my workspace. The pushback against AI assistant here and other places online is rampant. Articulate isn't listening to anyone.

LAYOUTS

Why is it such a secret which slides belong to which layouts? In Slide Master View nothing shows me which slides belong to what layout without right clicking on one and then choosing Apply LAyout and then seeing which layout is already highlighted. I can hover over a layout and it coyly reveals ""Used by 13 slides"". Really? Which 13 slides? Where are they? Clearly you know, so WHY DON'T YOU TELL US? My workaround is to put gigantic text boxes on every layout just so that I know which one I'm using at all times. Again, this should be a simple and obvious fix.

PICTURE EFFECTS

Why can't I save a picture effect to re-use it? I have a specific look I like for shadows on some shapes. I must manually add that shadow effect every single time by messing with the sliders manually, over and over. I can't say ""Save this as a custom shadow effect"". Again, seems like an obvious need. And using the painter won't work because the painter copies everything about the shape, including color and font. I just want to copy the shape effect. No can do.

GRADIENTS

I have a shape and have selected a color for it. But it needs a gradient. There are a bunch of default gradient types based on the color I chose, which is good, but the most obvious one is not provided (radial, light in the middle dark on edges) so I have to do it myself. I go into More Gradients... which takes me to the Format Picture dialog (with the Gradient Fill NOT already selected even though that's what I already said I was doing), so I select Gradient Fill and MY SHAPE COLOR IS CHANGED and there's no way to bring it back, which means Close the dialog, Ctrl-Z, save the color hex value, go all the way back into gradients and set each gradient stop manually. Just so that I can change my button to have a gradient that's list in the middle and dark on the edges. Come on, people.

These are just a few I thought of off the top of my head. They are all completely obvious fixes any self-respecting developer would go in and fix. What's going on over there? I'll tell you how it feels. Articulate doesn't care about existing users and is just trying to squeeze more profit by introducing toys like morphing and AI and assuming existing customers have no choice.

That the product is clearly one of those things that used to be cutting edge, exciting, engaging…but with no clear competitor it feels like all they’ve done over the last five years is jack up prices while offering shitty AI integrations that, as far as I can tell, nobody really asked for or was excited about.

Articulate voiceover question… Currently building out a course in Rise360 and I have the AI Assistant subscription. It seems like voiceovers can be created in Storyline 360 but I’m interested in creating AI-generated voiceovers that I can then upload as its own audio block in my Rise360 course. Is there a way to do this? Like could I create an AI generated voiceover in Storyline and then export the audio file so I could place it in Rise? Thanks in advance!,post,r/InstructionalDesign,Education,0.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/instructionaldesign/comments/1kub9uw/articulate_voiceover_question/
"Yes. Create the audio track in Storyline then right click it (either the speaker icon beside the slide or the audio track's row on the timeline) and choose Export.

"Framer Vector Editor + Animations On the heels of the posts about Articulate not listening to their customers or adding useful features, I wanted to share a company that's doing cool stuff that shows it's possible to innovate. I'm not affiliated with [Framer](http://www.framer.com) but I do use them for my business website. 

They just released a new update that allows you to draw vector paths anywhere on the Canvas (similar to the shape and freeform tools in Storyline) but also fully edit them, save them as components, modify all of their points and attributes, and animate them on hover or on custom interactions:   
[https://www.framer.com/updates/vectors](https://www.framer.com/updates/vectors)

I found Framer easier to learn but it's meant to build websites more than custom vector animations so the use cases are a bit different (and Rive still seems to be more powerful for custom animations compared to the new vector tools in Framer so a steeper learning curve is to be expected). 

In this same update Framer also added actually useful AI features for creating custom structured [layouts](https://www.framer.com/updates/wireframer) and [assets](https://www.framer.com/updates/workshop) AND they didn't raise the price of the subscription to do it.

"Built a tool for animating concept maps and flowcharts without motion graphics software – useful for learning content? I work in tech and often create explainers for non-technical folks. My biggest friction: animating diagrams that evolve step-by-step.

As an experiment, I built a web tool that lets you:  
– **Design visual diagrams** like flowcharts, cycles, or cause-effect maps  
– **Add animation order** with simple numbers (1, 2, 3…)  
– **Export as video or a single image** that is ready for teaching slides or explainer videos  
– Works entirely in-browser — no After Effects, no learning curve

It’s called [**Diagrams.Design**](http://Diagrams.Design), and some early adopters are instructional designers and educators using it to:  
– Animate lesson journeys  
– Show how systems evolve  
– Create engaging content for LMS or videos  
  
Here's a demo video created with my tool:

[Multi-flow Map Video](https://reddit.com/link/1ktdaq3/video/l6gvak3xbh2f1/player)

As someone new to this community, I’d love to ask:  
– Do you face this kind of design/animation bottleneck in your learning materials?  
– Would a tool like this fit into your content creation workflow?  
– Any features or formats (GIF, MP4, transparent PNG, etc.) that would be especially helpful?

">– Would a tool like this fit into your content creation workflow?

Probably not. Like another user said, it looks like something already possible in PPT.

But also, for something like this (with a lot of text), the ideal solution would be accessible in some format - so not a video or image. Perhaps an embedded Storyline in a Rise module or something (just thinking basic idea with common tools) to allow for screen readers and easy editing. 

This example basically just looks like a video with some images made in AI/Visio that have transparency keyframes or even just masks.

"The key difference is that [**Diagrams.Design**](http://Diagrams.Design) **is purpose-built for animating diagrams**, not slides. In authoring mode of **Diagrams Design**, user-experience is just like Lucidchart or [draw.io](http://draw.io) for creating diagrams. And for animation, think of it as **“animate by numbers”** rather than manual tweaking of motion paths and timelines.

PowerPoint is great for presentations, but not ideal for **video production workflows**. With Diagrams Design, you can export diagram videos optimised for all major creator platforms—landscape (YT), portrait (YT Shorts, Pinterest, TikTok), square (IG) and so on - with built-in ratio presets.

The demo above might seem generic, but more tailored examples—like this one for YT Shorts: [https://www.youtube.com/shorts/p3t0bWXa3hg](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/p3t0bWXa3hg) —are totally possible.

"Thanks for the thoughtful response — I really appreciate the accessibility angle you brought up. That’s a valid point, especially in instructional design contexts where screen readers and editable text matter.

To clarify: **Diagrams Design isn’t aiming to replace tools like PPT, Storyline, or Rise**. They’re amazing at building interactive and accessible modules. Instead, this tool is focused more on **diagram-centric videos that can be added into larger instructional videos.**

As mentioned earlier, the demo might look generic at first glance, but you can layer in more context and detail. For instance, this [diagram](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/GUCGkYoFS_Y) shows how technical icons can be incorporated, while this [journey-style example](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/r8wIgrC8R_4) demonstrates how more complex, narrative-driven diagrams can be animated.

"ID Department of One-eLearning Struggles Hey!

I am the only ID within my small organization, my coworker also has experience in ID/corporate L&D but no one else in my organization does (including my supervisor). My role is relatively new. We deal with highly technical (engineering type) content. I keep having projects brought to me that are very large time commitments- 24-40 hours in finished 
elearning content that are required training hours due to industry standards. 

I’ve been giving estimates of 12-18 months to complete this if I work on nothing else (based on previous projects and industry data). Since we are a small organization we do many things (involvement in marketing, sales, LMS admin stuff etc.) as well. They obviously don’t like this answer so I’ve been looking at AI tools but that really seems like it will only help incrementally in development timelines. 

My in person contacts in the industry are saying this is an unrealistic ask, but I feel like I’m going crazy saying the same thing over and over to them. Any suggestions of a way to make this ask doable, or am I setting myself up for failure?",post,r/InstructionalDesign,Education,11.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/instructionaldesign/comments/1ksqpan/id_department_of_oneelearning_struggles/
"I was just in that situation in my job, where I was the sole designer and developer for the whole company. Ultimately, my solution was to sell people on Rise. It cuts down development time and testing time so much. It also is very mobile friendly which was a major consideration for our training. 


I built templates and found tricks to speed up Rise development and make it look less bleh. Like, I made ""borders"" to add between blocks so the transitions were more attractive and it felt less blocky. 


I also set priorities. Compliance training for the whole company got custom graphics, interactions, videos, etc. Trainings for a small group got a much more basic treatment. 


So, I would pitch an alternate solution to them, whether or not it is Rise. As one developer for the whole company, you are not going to be able to do best-in-class, flashy training on a reasonable timeline. What can you do?",comment_1,r/InstructionalDesign,Education,,https://www.reddit.com/r/instructionaldesign/comments/1ksqpan/id_department_of_oneelearning_struggles/
"Give them different levels of interaction and estimates. If they want fast, interaction needs to be less and you should be developing in something fast like Rise vs. Storyline (not necessarily those tools but just as a reference). No voiceover, no audio, little animation, and simple knowledge checks. That will greatly speed up your development and lower the cost. 

If they want something more robust, they need to dedicate the time to it. 

Consider providing 3 options when estimating, a high, mid, and low. Explain what each of those involve, the time it will take, and the final product they can expect to receive. 

It also doesn't have to be a this or that. There could be some places or concepts where a more interactive approach would be beneficial - other places could be completely stripped out or provided as a job aid. If THEY are asking for high quality interactive content built in something like Storyline, your estimates are probably accurate. BUT if they are wanting something smaller in scope and done faster, you should be providing them alternatives. If they are not IDs, they likely don't know all their options and even less about what kind of effort each will take. It's up to you to set the baseline expectations for what kind of content they can expect within their budget and timeframe. 

Your client/supervisor/leadership should decide how they want to prioritize interaction, quality, time, and cost, but you should give them the information to make an informed decision and recommend the best middle ground compromise if they are unsatisfied with an initial estimation.",comment_2,r/InstructionalDesign,Education,,https://www.reddit.com/r/instructionaldesign/comments/1ksqpan/id_department_of_oneelearning_struggles/

"Need advice: stay where I'm at or switch companies? A company I do some part-time contract work with approached me about joining them full-time as a curriculum developer. This is the same work I've done in my contracts with them, so I know what the expectations are and I already know two people on the team. Here's what I've been trying to consider: 

* I am happy at my current company and have learned a lot in my time there. I'm still relatively new to the field and feel I still have more to learn in my current role. I'm not actively looking for another job. 
* The new role would be a $5k-$10k pay raise. However, my current company offers tuition reimbursement and I'm working on my master's degree; if I leave, I have to pay back what I've been reimbursed for. I would consider asking the new company to help me pay that back. The new company also does not have tuition reimbursement, so I would be paying for the rest of my degree out of pocket (but I would also be getting paid more). 
* Benefits are pretty comparable in both roles: they're both remote, have decent PTO and health insurance, etc. 
* The new company is a nonprofit so the retirement match is not as good--3% vs 6%. 
* My contact at the new company let me know that there are not really opportunities for growth, so I would be taking this job with the knowledge that I would probably want to look for another job in a few years if I wanted more money or a different role. 
* The role is developing test prep curriculum for high schoolers (think ACT, SAT), so I wonder if some people would see that as a step back on my resume. I used to be a teacher, got my current role as an ID, and wonder if this role would hurt my chances for future ID roles. 

For those of you who have more experience in the field, what do you think? Again, I'm happy where I'm at; I'm also considering just talking to my boss about this opportunity and saying ""hey, they're offering me this much; can you match that? I'd really like to stay here.""",post,r/InstructionalDesign,Education,0.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/instructionaldesign/comments/1kt192r/need_advice_stay_where_im_at_or_switch_companies/

"If you're happy where you're at, what's the benefit in changing jobs? I mean, beside the immediate salary bump. 

* You'll have to pay back tuition you've already received, plus cover those costs yourself going forward. That's money OUT of your pocket.
* Your 401(k) match will drop by half (3% vs. 6%). Not only will you lose money today, you'll also lose the ability to compound that money in the years ahead. That loss could be substantial, and the younger you are, the more you're losing.
* No opportunity for growth means what you're doing today you'll be doing f-o-r-e-v-e-r. Do you favor predictability enough to make it the theme of your professional life for the foreseeable future?
* Corporate employers rarely know how to evaluate the skill set of people who have a long background in an ""academic"" type job. It's likely that you will be perceived as less capable going forward, even with a master's degree under your belt.

If there's no pressing need to change jobs now, sit tight, finish your degree, then figure out a next step that will actually benefit you, both in terms of career opportunity and financial gain.

"Job Market and AI Hey all, I know there are resources for people considering ID as a career. However, the pinned posts don't seem active/recent, and the questions I have arent in the ""becoming an ID"" thread- so I think these are not considered ""general advice"" and are more specific than that. I hope that's OK. 

I've been working as a UX designer for a few years, and contemplating trying to get into instructional design. I do see a crossover of skills between the 2 trades. Although I love UX, what I have learned the hard way is the sudden volatility in the tech job market, the exporting of jobs overseas, the oversaturation and over-competitiveness, and the trade seems to be in serious danger from AI. 

So if you would like, help me research this potential transition by sharing your experience and thoughts about a few questions I'm wondering about. 

 I know that the job market is tough for everyone right now, outside of ID and I'm assuming inside ID as well. My question is, is it expected to stay that way, and what is it like normally? Is it very difficult finding entry level jobs under normal circumstances? 

 Do instructional designers experience a similar ultra-competitiveness and oversaturation as UX'ers do?

 Is there a fear that the trade will be significantly hurt by AI? Why or why not? 

 In case it matters, I have a bachelors of business admin., a minor in arts (design focus), and a bunch of UX-related certifications. Prior to working in design, I worked as a private investigator. Thanks in advance.",post,r/InstructionalDesign,Education,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/instructionaldesign/comments/1ksz6jl/job_market_and_ai/
"Sorry to be the bearer of bad news but pretty much all the concerns of AI and job market with UX/UI is the same with ID. This can be dependent on location but in general its the same issues - AI streamlining jobs causing less opportunities, influx of people attempting to get an ID job making job opportunities flooded (even if many are not qualified). Getting an initial ID job is probably very difficult now. I'm lucky in that I already have one, but I would imagine its about as tough as getting a junior UX/UI job right now.",comment_1,r/InstructionalDesign,Education,,https://www.reddit.com/r/instructionaldesign/comments/1ksz6jl/job_market_and_ai/
"Also keep in mind that remote jobs are by far the most competitive. If you're able to be on-site, the amount of competition does drop drastically. It's still saturated because...every job is.

"I've been in the L&D world as an ID for 14 years, but have been closely aware of it and what's happening for more than 30 years. L&D is often among the first teams to see cuts and layoffs. Even when a company values learning, it goes away. For more reasons than I care to post about, companies don't see L&D as a profit machine.

One very large company, over 100,000 employees, laid off most of it's North American learning team in the past year. They went from about 75 employees and contractors down to a dozen. Now imagine you're competing for a job with those 65ish experienced, laid off employees.

Over the last 4/5 years many, many teachers have tried to transition to ID work. Minimally they understand something about learning, even if it's not adult learning.

What do you bring that will differentiate you and make you a more desirable candidate than a person educated in instructional systems technology or education?",comment_3,r/InstructionalDesign,Education,,https://www.reddit.com/r/instructionaldesign/comments/1ksz6jl/job_market_and_ai/
"This can depend on your country perhaps. I know in the states, it seems like there was been a large exodus of teachers since COVID with many moving towards ID or ID-adjacent roles. This seemed to cause a lot of saturation in the market.

I'm in Canada, and I'm currently casually browsing for new opportunities and I see a decent amount of job postings. I just started applying without a portfolio developed yet (doing so currently) so no responses yet, but I'm fortunate to live near Toronto and other major cities so there's more jobs around me than someone up north or more down south. As well, teachers in Ontario seem to be better paid than their American counterparts, so there is perhaps less competition from that end (though I do know teachers looking to move out and into ID).

You'll need to stand out in some way in the job market. Whether this is through education or a really strong portfolio (probably both). And if the job requires a technical skillset, standing out from others with higher level of visual design, video editing, etc. can only help.",comment_4,r/InstructionalDesign,Education,,https://www.reddit.com/r/instructionaldesign/comments/1ksz6jl/job_market_and_ai/
"Hey, I’m a very seasoned L&D professional. I once worked in Web design and got into UX before I became a teacher then after 10 years in education-went into corporate L&D. If I can share my experience in my local job market it could possibly help gain some insight. 

The transition back when I moved from education into L&D back in 2016 was really hard. I had to continue teaching while I took on low paying and even free ID work to build my portfolio. All the while I was also scatter gun applying for jobs, attending conferences, networking etc. Eventually, after 2 years of mad hustle I got a 2 month contract in 2018 and quit teaching. After that I monkey barred from one fixed term or contract position to another. Covid hit hard but then after that we did have a little “boom” in ppl wanting learning online. Personally, I got some great brands on my CV during this period and landed my first ever permanent position but many new ppl entered the market too. After that little boom there was a massive shrinking. We currently see org wide layoffs where L&D is deprioritised to the point of entire teams being disestablished. 

I was looking down the barrel of my second restructure in 7 months and found a role in a more lucrative industry. For context, data for this: first pool was hundreds of people. Initial culling rendered a pool of 90 individuals. First round of interviews I was in a pool of 10 learning and development professionals with good experience. Shortlisted to 3 people then finally selected after a gruelling free “project creation and delivery” exercise. 

Even as a seasoned L&D professional I face challenges of not being a Subject Matter Expert in the areas I enter. This shouldn’t be a problem based on good ID methodology but in the shrinkages we see SMEs being prioritised over L&D practitioners as they have business knowledge that can’t be automated.",comment_5,r/InstructionalDesign,Education,,https://www.reddit.com/r/instructionaldesign/comments/1ksz6jl/job_market_and_ai/

"I've been freelance for much of my career. Clients and work come from my personal network. Full transparency, I knew a lot of people in positions to hire me. I didn't have to hustle for clients or work. Unfortunately for me much of my network is now retired.

First, don't assume you'll be making more $. I've seen a shameful decrease in rates over the past few months. One recruiter tried to convince me that $25/hour was a good rate for someone with over a decade of experience.

Other considerations that cost $.

* You don't get paid if you take time off. You don't get paid for holidays or if a company has a mandatory shut down period. Many companies basically close up between Christmas & Jan 2. The expectation is that you will not work or bill if the company has time off. Between holidays and maybe a vacation or two, assume you'll only work, and get paid, for 48 weeks.
* Some companies will require you contract through a staffing agency. You'll have to take a cut in your hourly rate that goes to the agency. This saves the company time, and it helps prevent the possibility that the government will see you as an employee. That's a huge risk for companies.
* Small businesses will require you to provide your own equipment and have your own subscriptions to tools like Articulate, Microsoft, Adobe, etc. Mid-size and larger companies will often provide a laptop and access to the tools you need.
* You may need to set up an LLC or other entity. Some might ask for this information. Cost will vary based on your state. In some states, maybe all of them, you have to pay a fee to register the LLC each year.
* Along with an LLC, some places will require you have business insurance. A basic policy for a year is around $450. For large contracts they will want a larger policy which can be costly.
* Opening a business checking account may have a fee associated with it. You must keep your personal and business expenses and income separate. You pay yourself from your business account.
* Speaking of accounts, you might want to use an accountant for at least the first few years.
* If you are working under a 1099, plan to pay your Social Security and taxes quarterly. No employer is taking care of that for you. You'll also pay the full amount required for Social Security without an employer contribution. That said, I have seen more and more staffing type agencies using a W2 which makes the entire tax and Social Security thing easier.
* If you don't have a partner that can add you to their health insurance policy, prepare to pay for this. BTW-the ACA subsidy will end in 2025. I don't expect the current administration or Congress to extend that. I'm expecting my insurance cost to double next year for really crappy insurance.
* Plan to save for your own retirement via a 401K or other means. You are the ""employer"" contribution.
* Have 3-6 months (at least) of expenses saved up before you make the jump to self-employment. Also always save several months of personal expenses for those times when you are without work. It does happen.
* Prepare to spend some time weekly/month doing the ""business stuff.""

About flexibility-this is only partially true. My clients expect me to be available during normal business hours if I have a 40 hour a week contract. They generally don't care where I'm at when I'm working though. I've worked from other states, but kept my normal time zone appropriate hours. I do tell them if I am taking a vacation or a few days off. I try not to schedule this during a time I know will be critical to a project.

I really don't intend to sound negative here. I've been working this way for a long time. My spouse also was an independent contractor for something else so we've been through it all. It has it's plusses, but there is a downside.",comment_2,r/InstructionalDesign,Education,,https://www.reddit.com/r/instructionaldesign/comments/1ksi5lm/mentorship_connecting_with_fellow_freelance_ids/

"What tools or workflows are actually helping you reduce course creation time? Hi everyone! I’ve been speaking to dozens of instructional designers and educators over the past few weeks, and a recurring theme keeps coming up — how time-consuming course creation still is, even with modern tools.

Some shared how they’re juggling multiple platforms (authoring, LMS, collaboration tools), while others mentioned how difficult it is to keep things updated or aligned with learning goals when the tech stack gets too fragmented.

So I’m curious what tools, hacks, or processes have actually made your instructional design work faster or easier?

"Urgent: Help choosing between two contract offers I have gotten an offer for two contract jobs at once.  I had been an ID focused on systems training at a pharma company for 17 years.  I have been applying for jobs for over 5 months.

Both are W2 contracts through recruiting firms (Teksystems and Insight Global) and both have pretty terrible benefits.  There is no PTO for either job.

One job is a **6 month contract with possible extension or conversion to FTE** with a major logistics company that is merging various parts of their businesses into one business.  The ID would help create the program from the ground up (or that is my impression).  The rate is $5.00 per hour lower than the other job.

The 2nd job is at a hospital/healthcare chain for a **2 year contract** working on eLearning development for a WorkDay supply chain ERP implementation.  The rate is $5.00 more per hour than the other job.

"Just wondering if this is normal Hello everyone. I am an instructional designer in a regulated industry and I've been feeling like I don't do much instructional design work. 80% of our materials are written lessons with PowerPoints and I would say 90% of my role is just editing, not creating new lessons, based on changes in our policy. We are not given the specific changes or informed of what we need to change, we have to go through this massive (600pg) policy handbook, understand the changes, and then figure out which lesson needs to be impacted. We have 250+ lessons so even finding the impacted lesson is extemely time consuming and the subject matter is difficult to understand.  I'm constantly feeling stressed and overwhelemed because I'm expected to be a subject matter expert on something that feels close to impossible to be an expert on in less than 5 years, and I also have no time to methodically go through and study the content because I constantly am just trying to keep up with needed edits. I've brought up a document index but the response I get is we have no time to create it.

"Need inputs regarding freelance project I am an ID with ~2 yrs of experience. Graduated Masters in 2023. I have just now started freelancing. One of my projects include writing scripts for short courses on Rise. Please note, I only write the script (simulation, assessment activities, etc) and it is not developed on Rise by me. 

In my full time role, I was not required to create courses on Rise (there was a separate design team for that), and hence never could learn it. However, my client now wants me to also develop it on Rise. They will help me learn it and give me access to the tool.

I am currently charging only for the script-writing (~60$ per script) and wanted to understand how much extra I should charge for developing the scripts on Rise - keeping in mind that I have no prior experience working on rise and my total work experience. 

These are very simple micro-learnings. Take about 15 mins to complete.",post,r/InstructionalDesign,Education,0.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/instructionaldesign/comments/1kry6bm/need_inputs_regarding_freelance_project/
"It's hard to say, especially since I wouldn't consider 15 minutes of seat time to be a microlearning. Rise is an incredibly simple tool to learn and use, but you have to put time into Rise courses to make them look good and be instructionally effective. So, you could throw something basic together in like an hour or two after you finish the script, but you're probably looking at more like a minimum of 30-40 hours for something worthwhile. If anyone is like ""wtf"" at that timeline, I make a lot of custom graphics and diagrams and interactions for my Rise courses, because I am all about breaking up the text. 


I also used to charge hourly vs per deliverable when I freelanced, and I charged about $50-60 per hour at your level of experience (though I do have a Masters in the field). So, $60 per script for 15 minutes of seat time seems incredibly cheap to me. That's so much content!


So, I guess my advice would be to grab a free trial of Articulate 360 and check Rise out. They have some sample courses in the tool that you can look at to see how they are built. 


I would also consider what would be a minimum workable hourly rate for you, and then use that to calculate the charge. I probably wouldn't do the whole project (script + development) for less than $180, with the understanding that my client would get a nice, clean, but basic course. And that's based on your script rate, rather than my hourly rate. ",comment_1,r/InstructionalDesign,Education,,https://www.reddit.com/r/instructionaldesign/comments/1kry6bm/need_inputs_regarding_freelance_project/

"ID & Project Management How do you deal when you’re in a consistent cycle of terribly managed projects, feedback that could seriously wait to be implemented until you’re over the hump of complete curriculum development and being pressured about deadlines when a project was doomed to fail from the beginning in regards to the ask vs the deadline?

How do you deal when you know the ship is destined to sink but you have to board it?

I’m frustrated. I tried to take initiative and implement PM structure…it was taken over by leadership (when they should’ve done so to begin with if you ask me) and I was essentially told to stay in my lane.

How do you deal when you get feedback saying “I don’t want words on slides” but then pressure and blame about deadlines when you‘re putting in real effort for a long-lasting deliverable?

I truly love ID as a career…but I’m drained and frustrated with feeling like I’m being set up to fail.

Imagine having all the design tools at your disposal…the org invests crazy dollars for subscriptions…to only use them on a rudimentary level.

"This one is probably endemic to the industry: *Imagine having all the design tools at your disposal…the org invests crazy dollars for subscriptions…to only use them on a rudimentary level*. I don't know if that will ever change. One thing you can do is come up with a few tricks with your software that you can do quickly and easily and exploit those. For example, I often take images, and animate them by rotating, having a text bubble pop up, or flying in text. Very simply, done in Photoshop and exported as a gif, or done in most video editing software. I've got a simple workflow, I can do it really quickly, and it adds some flair to what would otherwise be static images. 

This is just my opinion, but I think the biggest skill you can have in a deadline based industry (or any really) is *knowing the difference between good, and good enough*. If words on a page is not enough, then put a pretty picture, or an animated gif, or video that aligns with the text (keep Mayer's principles in mind). That will often be enough to satisfy someone. Or something like the short animation I mentioned above. 

I'll use this example of good vs good enough. The Looney Tunes/Merrie Melodies cartoon shorts were little 3-5 minute cartoons. They took a couple dozen (or more) people about 3-6 months to make *one of them*. When TV came along, that was too long. So they did things like the old Clutch Cargo cartoon. Real mouths superimposed over static images. Planes flying with static backgrounds, switch animations with no tweens. (example: [https://youtu.be/NsBjOWmKGsI?si=0AKRy1vVl985RvYV&t=73](https://youtu.be/NsBjOWmKGsI?si=0AKRy1vVl985RvYV&t=73) ). They sucked, but they were good enough. The Thunderbirds were marionettes, and they're cult classics. Pokemon and Dragon Ball Z did much the same thing, using panning, zooming, and animated backgrounds to create the illusion of motion. South Park's cutout animation is a modern example. It's nowhere as good as the Simpson's animation, but it's just as much in the cultural lexicon. Hallmark movies are another example. They take million dollars and 5 months to complete from script development, location scouting, filming, editing, *everything.* They aren't necessarily good, but they're *good enough*.

What you have to do is decide what are things *you* can do quickly, that will satisfy the stakeholders minimum requirements, while keeping an eye open for doing a little extra when the opportunity presents itself. Maybe try some of these things, they're easy to do but go a bit beyond basic text/images:

* Instead of plain text, record it as a script and use a static image that illustrates or is related to the text.
* Use your phone to take a < 1 minute video of yourself demonstrating a concept.
* Video record your computer screen.
* Take an image, and make several copies of it, rotating each iteration slightly to make it appear to move. Use an online gif maker for this.",comment_1,r/InstructionalDesign,Education,,https://www.reddit.com/r/instructionaldesign/comments/1kqt369/id_project_management/
"This post caught my eye yesterday, but I wanted to take time to write a thoughtful.  I've gone back and forth on whether or not to respond. I’ve faced many of the frustrations you’re describing: poorly scoped projects, leadership interference without accountability, contradictory feedback, and the feeling that you’re being set up to fail. You’re not alone.

At the risk of sounding patronizing or cheesy, this is my list of lessons learned over the past years as an ID.

* **Always be working on the most important thing.** This sounds simple, but in a mess of shifting priorities, it’s surprisingly easy to lose sight. Ask yourself daily: “What matters most right now for this project to move forward?” That clarity reduces wasted effort.
* **If you don’t know what the most important thing is, consult your manager.** Their job is to define that for you. If they can’t or won’t answer, document that. Keep a paper trail. It forces accountability and protects you if things go sideways.
* **You can’t want the solution more than the stakeholder.** This one took me a long time to accept. If you’re trying harder than your SME or your leadership to make the project succeed, that’s a red flag. Match their energy. Do not outpace it. Just make sure it's visible that you did your part.
* **EVERYTHING in writing.** Meeting notes, decisions, scope changes, feedback contradictions—write it all down. Confirm via email. It’s not about being defensive; it’s about staying sane and keeping a record of reality.
* **Be inevitable.** Probably the cheesiest thing on this list, but this quality has done more for my professional image than anything else. When it comes to work, I don't get angry. I don't get frustrated. I simply continue to the next thing. 
   * If people want to pitch a hissy fit and not play ball? Noted. I'll forward that to my manager and let them sort it out. 
   * If people want to focus on systemic issues with the company/management instead of the problem, let them vent and then follow it up with ""Got it. So what's our next step?""
   * The point is you **are always moving towards the goal**, even if it's at a snail's pace, and if you're following the points above, you have a paper trail that indicates that.

I hope that helps. I also understand why you’d consider stepping into management. If you have the temperament for it, that may not be a bad path, just be aware that management brings a different kind of frustration.",comment_2,r/InstructionalDesign,Education,,https://www.reddit.com/r/instructionaldesign/comments/1kqt369/id_project_management/
"Hey, honestly, this is a terrible situation you’re in. But just know - this kind of struggle is something most of us face at some point...

I have faced a similar situation before where the project scope increased 3x during execution. They still expected us to deliver everything within the original deadline. Yes, they provided some extra manpower, but it wasn’t enough. We are not just doing random tasks that anyone can jump in and deliver the same quality. It simply doesn’t work that way.

As expected, the final content wasn’t as good as it could’ve been. But I was able to justify the MVP—because we documented everything.

From the beginning, we noted down the initial scope, timelines, and expectations. When they added more work, I tracked the new requirements, additional manpower, and existing gaps. That documentation helped me to show them why the final outcome turned out the way it did. It wasn’t about blaming—it was about showing the real constraints.

What helped me the most, though, was having colleagues who understood the pressure. Working with people like that made collaboration smoother and really helped manage the stress. I hope you find someone like that too.

"A lot has already been said here, but I also have a take I could contribute:  

I always work in layers—first layer text, second layer images, third layer videos. Each layer is a minimally viable product that could, if necessary, be rolled out or handed off to someone else.  

The next layer is only added once the previous one is finished.  

If the client has a great idea, I tell them we’ll do it at the very end in the final layer. Most of the time, we end up not doing any of those client ideas because we run out of time.  

If the deadline gets pushed back or I don’t have enough time, we simply do fewer layers.  

A fundamental rule is also that the project is never really 'done.' I never label anything as 'Final' because that just annoys the client. I always provide the current status and negotiate with the client about what they still want by the deadline.  

I also usually have a weekly half-hour meeting with the subject matter experts where they have to answer all my questions—and I don’t work on anything until those questions are answered.",comment_5,r/InstructionalDesign,Education,,https://www.reddit.com/r/instructionaldesign/comments/1kqt369/id_project_management/

During the pandemic, a certain YouTube influencer promised the world that it was a quick and easy transition from classroom to online education. And tens of thousands of classroom teachers made the career switch, although it was much more difficult, time consuming, technical, and expensive than the YouTuber had described. 

The market is now quite oversaturated, and that has greatly reduced salaries. Have you considered a career in project management? Technical writing? Contract proposal writing? Grant writing? Animation design? Working as a traveling corporate training presenter? Online sales enablement? Online training sales? Customer satisfaction training? 

I wish you the very best, and I thank you for your service as a classroom teacher.",comment_2,r/InstructionalDesign,Education,,https://www.reddit.com/r/instructionaldesign/comments/1kqmc7o/entry_level_id_positions_and_salary/

"Questions About Articulate Storyline 360 & Being a Self-Taught Instructional Designer Hey everyone! 
I’m still relatively new to instructional design and mostly self-taught. I am using Articulate Storyline 360 and had a few questions that I’d love some guidance on from the pros here:

1. Where should I be saving my Storyline files? 
Right now, I save my .story files to a shared network drive, and I haven’t had any issues yet. But I’ve read a few horror stories online. Should I be saving to my local drive instead? What’s the best practice here?

2. How do you organize your project files?
I’ve got my .story file, voiceover scripts, images, videos, etc.—but I feel like my folders are getting messy. Do you follow a specific file structure that works well for you?

3. Any tips for version control?

4. For self-taught IDs: what helped you grow the most?
I’m learning on the job, but I’d love to hear what resources, courses, or routines helped you build your skills the fastest.

5. How do you stay creative with your designs while also sticking to brand guidelines?
I sometimes feel limited by the templates and branding requirements, but I also don’t want everything to feel the same. Any suggestions?
	
6. Any advice on creating templates in Storyline?
I’ve been tasked with creating a few templates for future trainings, and I’m not sure where to start. What do you usually include? How do you make sure they’re flexible enough to reuse but still polished?

Thanks in advance for your help! I really appreciate this community. It’s been a huge help as I figure things out. 😊",post,r/InstructionalDesign,Education,15.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/instructionaldesign/comments/1kqedt9/questions_about_articulate_storyline_360_being_a/
"1. I think saving .story files to shared network drive is fine. Just DO NOT OPEN AND EDIT from the network drive. Always download to your computer, edit, save, and reupload the new file. I've had files corrupted in the past from either myself or team members not doing this. 

2. I like to do Project Title > .story file + assets folder + docs folder + scorm folder as my files. I also don't save 100 versions of my scripts like Project\_Title\_v02\_DB\_EDITS.docx that drives me BONKERS. It's just Project\_Title\_Script.docx and it just gets saved over every time. If needed I create an Archive folder. 

3. Be thoughtful of your titling and file structure if you need to save older versions. You can also use a spreadsheet to keep track. 

4. Your templates will go through versions as you build more that make sense. At my last job we got up to template\_v10 because we just made it better as we moved along. All the IDs agreed on what went into the template. We curated a DAM of approved icons, graphics, photos.",comment_1,r/InstructionalDesign,Education,,https://www.reddit.com/r/instructionaldesign/comments/1kqedt9/questions_about_articulate_storyline_360_being_a/

"1. Saving to a shared network drive should be fine, but personally, I prefer to work locally and only transfer files to the shared drive once I consider them “done.”
2. My typical folder structure looks like this: **\[Project Name Folder\]** → Storyline file → SCORM package → Assets → Dependencies from Stakeholders/SMEs → Meeting recordings (including handoff/TTT sessions)
3. To stay organized, I use an Excel tracker with review links and course codes. I also maintain a dedicated folder for all active files, everything else goes into an archive folder.
4. I continuously learn by reviewing other projects and sitting in when fellow IDs present their work. We also hold internal “show and tell” sessions to share new discoveries or creative approaches.
5. To keep my courses visually fresh and modern, I regularly draw inspiration from UI/UX design trends.",comment_3,r/InstructionalDesign,Education,,https://www.reddit.com/r/instructionaldesign/comments/1kqedt9/questions_about_articulate_storyline_360_being_a/
"right?!

I prefer version by number instead of date.

And nothing wrong with having a ton of old versions, just keep things clean in the main folder. Use an ""Archive"" or ""Old"" to put anything but the current one in.

"1. Where should I be saving my Storyline files? Local if/when you can, and then move them to a shared drive when you are done. Keep old versions in case of corruption. For most of us, we only need to learn to do these the hard way once.
2. How do you organize your project files? 2 main folders: DEPLOY (where the final SCORM package goes, ONLY the most recent SCORM package goes in here. If you are updating a course, delete out \[or put in an Archive folder\] the older SCORM package. This makes it so that no one in the future hesitates to understand ""Which version is live in the LMS?"") and DEVELOPMENT. In the Development folder you have everything needed/created/were given to make the course. This could mean a bunch of subfolders: Audio, Images, Planning, Original Source Files, etc. ""Archive"" folders are also your friend to keep old versions of SCORM pages, .story files, old scripts, etc. so you can CYA moving forward or so the next person to come behind you can track what happened over time with the course.
3. For self-taught IDs: Learning on the job; there will be projects that come your way that you aren't exactly sure how to do specific development for. Those projects make you think harder and grow your skillset. 
4. How do you stay creative with your designs while also sticking to brand guidelines? Once you learn how to use the template as-is, THEN you can work on ""breaking"" the template in subtle ways to make it more creative.  Also, don't hesitate to recommend a special NEW-ly made template for large scale multi-course learning paths/projects that all go together so you can ""brand"" them special. 
5. Any advice on creating templates in Storyline? Master Slides are your friend and so is the color theme picker. Use wisely and often.",comment_5,r/InstructionalDesign,Education,,https://www.reddit.com/r/instructionaldesign/comments/1kqedt9/questions_about_articulate_storyline_360_being_a/

"ID & Project Management How do you deal when you’re in a consistent cycle of terribly managed projects, feedback that could seriously wait to be implemented until you’re over the hump of complete curriculum development and being pressured about deadlines when a project was doomed to fail from the beginning in regards to the ask vs the deadline?

  
How do you deal when you know the ship is destined to sink but you have to board it? 

I’m frustrated. I tried to take initiative and implement PM structure…it was taken over by leadership (when they should’ve done so to begin with if you ask me)  and I was essentially told to stay in my lane.

How do you deal when you get feedback saying “I don’t want words on slides” but then pressure and blame about deadlines when you‘re putting in real effort for a long-lasting deliverable?

I truly love ID as a career…but I’m drained and frustrated with feeling like I’m being set up to fail.

Imagine having all the design tools at your disposal…the org invests crazy dollars for subscriptions…to only use them on a rudimentary level.

I’m to the point of wanting to step into management solely because I’m fed up with being a scapegoat.

"Hey! I work at Weglot and just wanted to share a few things that might help.

Weglot doesn’t just translate your content, it also handles the technical SEO side automatically. That includes hreflang tags, translated metadata, and clean URLs, which are all super important for multilingual SEO. Without those, Google can get confused and your international pages might not even show up properly.

You get a first layer of automatic translation to get started fast, and then you (or your team or a pro translator) can refine everything in the Weglot dashboard. It also detects new content automatically, so you’re not constantly redoing translations when your site updates.

Bonus: it even supports media translation so you can show different images depending on the language version.

"Best Authoring Tool for a Corporate training company? Looking at Articulate, i-Spring Suite and Adobe Captivate.

Also, an eLearning developer would be a great thing to invest in. You need a different level of quality for content you are going to sell.",comment_2,r/InstructionalDesign,Education,,https://www.reddit.com/r/instructionaldesign/comments/1kq0d9j/best_authoring_tool_for_a_corporate_training/
"So there's a couple considerations here that you should think about in narrowing down your options. Your **authoring tool** is how you create the content but your **website/LMS** is where you will host or sell your content if you want any tracking/metrics from the output.

The next thing you should consider is what type of content you need to create. If you're going mostly video-based, you don't need a tool that has the features of Articulate, iSpring, or Captivate - you just need something to create videos + an LMS. If you're going for complex interactive courses, all three of those could work, but you should consider what return you're getting for the extra cost and time for development. Will your learners benefit from the types of interactions you can do in Storyline or would they be fine with something more akin to the web-based approach like Rise or similar?

Recently, I put together a Storyline course that had a ton of custom interactions and animations and then ended up redoing it in Rise because it just kinda dragged along. Not that the content was boring or not useful, but the client wanted to lock down the learners so they had to watch everything before moving on which just makes it take longer to sit through all the video and interaction. After switching to Rise, they ended up really liking the ability to just read and scroll through the content without having to watch a 2-3 minute video for every concept. This is just one anecdote and your content COULD really benefit from a more interactive or visual approach vs. a more text based approach, but it's important to think about how much ""extra"" you're getting for the tradeoff.

The other thing you mentioned is selling courses. Most authoring tools will not provide hosting AND payment links. I think the only one I know of right now that does that is[ Coassemble](http://coassemble.com) however it's a lot more limited in what you can do. It's similar to Articulate Rise but doesn't have as many options for content blocks.

The Articulate Suite has Reach which functions as a very lightweight LMS so if all you wanted to do was get some basic training metrics and allow people to take the course, it'd work without any of the bells and whistles of a full-blown LMS but it kinda further locks you into their pricing structure and there's additional costs to using Reach after you hit a user threshold.  Either way though, you'd have to figure out a payment gateway to actually sell your course.

If you're already using Wordpress for your website, the[ LearnDash](http://learndash.com) plugin is an easy way to add the payment gateway and LMS features to your existing site. I personally really dislike wordpress but I figured I'd add that here just because it might not make sense to completely redo your entire site.

If you're more site agnostic or open to changing, I've had really good experience using[ LearnWorlds](https://get.learnworlds.com/dah7iecpp3ur) with several of my clients. It's a full LMS + a website builder that supports several different options for payment gateways. It also allows you to build your website there so you don't need to pay for both a website and an LMS - but you can always just link to it for the LMS side and keep your existing website as the front page if you already have a way to sell your courses there.

I guess another consideration here is you could technically get away with skipping the authoring tool entirely and use the functions of the LMS to create your content. Most LMSs these days allow you to create pages and upload videos and create quizzes. So again, the question comes down to what type of content you're really looking to create.

I'm personally starting to ditch Articulate for[ Parta.io](http://parta.io) and so far have been pretty happy with it. It's about a 1/3 of the price for the Teams version and you can pay monthly if you need to scale up and down on additional users. It also allows you to collaborate in real time on courses and has sharing and commenting features similar to Articulate Review. It's a newer company so their still growing and adding features, which is a nice change from Storyline.

I still use Storyline frequently but trying to get more of my clients out of it and into other platforms when possible. I haven't used iSpring that much but it seems like alternative if Storyline is out of your budget and you need similar features. Captivate is sunsetting their Storyline competitor and moved to a more Rise-like web based version with less features. It also doesn't seem like Adobe is that interested in promoting or servicing this product which makes it a little harder to recommend.

As others have mentioned, Camtasia is also a really good choice for video-based content. You can add interactive quizzes in the middle of your videos and it's actually just a really good video editor on its own.

Regardless of the tool, think about what your needs are and look for the thing that best fits that. Don't just settle with Articulate because it's the standard. The only caveat to that is if you are also gonna be hiring people to create your content. It will be a lot easier to find Storyline developers than for Coassemble or Parta. They do exist, and honestly a lot of these skills are transferrable from one platform to another after getting over a small learning curve, but that is something to keep in mind if you're going that route.",comment_3,r/InstructionalDesign,Education,,https://www.reddit.com/r/instructionaldesign/comments/1kq0d9j/best_authoring_tool_for_a_corporate_training/

"How much effort do you put into projects for interviews? In my experience, jobs will have you do some sort of case study or short course. My question is, how much effort do you put into it? I'm a bit torn between going all out with the bells and whistles and giving enough to show my skill. 

I'm not sure which one gives you the better advantage. The first option can be quite time-consuming and that's where my quagmire is. You put all the time and hours in and not getting paid. But also you want to stand out from the crowd and really showcase your skills.

Again, this inquiry is for people who have done or in the mist of doing it. 

I know they are various opinions on whether to do it at all but that's NOT what I'm asking so no need to pontificate on why you don't do these types of projects.",post,r/InstructionalDesign,Education,12.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/instructionaldesign/comments/1kosmlf/how_much_effort_do_you_put_into_projects_for/
"How much do you want that particular job?

Will you be able to use the project in your portfolio if you don't get the job? 

If your portfolio would benefit from the project, then it seems worthwhile to put in more effort. You'd get a benefit that way even if you don't get that specific job, and hopefully it will help you get something else.",comment_1,r/InstructionalDesign,Education,,https://www.reddit.com/r/instructionaldesign/comments/1kosmlf/how_much_effort_do_you_put_into_projects_for/
"If the project has a recommended amount of time it should take, use that as your guideline.

Otherwise, set yourself a time budget and ask ""Okay, what can I reasonably get done in that amount of time?""

What is generally true in projects is that you can adjust your scope to fit a fixed timeline or you can adjust your timeline to fit a fixed scope (you can also adjust both scope and timeline, but you can't have both a fixed scope AND a fixed timeline).

So a skill that I'm _really_ interested in is the ability to recognize which of those cases is happening right now and to then make decisions.

Anyways, set your time budget, then be ready to say ""I gave myself 4 hours. Based on the spec, these items appeared to be the most important, so I did those first. I chose to skip these other items <for these reasons>. If I had another 4 hours, I would have done this, that, and the other thing next.""

This does require that you're able to look at the project brief and ask ""What is the one most important thing here they want to see?""

Is it:

- Skill with designing course materials
- Skill with developing assessments, etc.
- Skill with parsing somewhat ambiguous requirements and outcomes into a thing you can actually build
- Skill with specific tools, e.g. course authoring software, A/V tools, etc.?
- Skill with visual design, adding in high levels of polish, etc.?
- Skill with making decisions about scope and parsing out ambiguity?
- Skill with taking what the SMEs and stakeholders say and turning that into things like learning outcomes?
- Willingness to do significant amounts of unpaid labor?
- Something else?

And who knows... maybe the interviewers themselves don't have a great idea of what they're looking for. That happens a lot.

I'd be absolutely thrilled with something like this: 

""Based on the materials, here were the most important learning outcomes. In real life I'd first solicit feedback before moving forward, but for the sake of the interview I chose to just move forward with my outline as it is. Then I built a module for one of the outcomes, with a moderate amount of visual polish. I also have outlines for other modules, but chose to skip building out the module proper in favor of adding some relatively light-weight visual polish. The whole thing took me 6 hours, which felt like an appropriate amount of time for a take-home project.""

(""6 hours"" is just for the sake of the example, not guidance on how much time you should actually spend).

I, personally, would be really concerned if I saw a project that clearly took a significant amount of time. This is part of the reason I very deliberately set a time limit in the rare cases where I give take home projects (and why I don't give those assignments unless I can pay people for their time). First, don't do that to yourself. And second, people who regularly light themselves on fire for the sake of the team are a giant pain to manage (those fires have a nasty way of spreading), and that's not behavior I'm going to encourage. It's part of why I set very deliberate, very firm time limits.

THAT SAID:

If you're in a spot where you're acting out of need (e.g. ""I need a job soon or I won't be able to afford rent or food""), then sometimes you just gotta do whatever it takes. And it sucks. It sucks so much to be in that spot. But if that's where you are, do whatever it takes.",comment_2,r/InstructionalDesign,Education,,https://www.reddit.com/r/instructionaldesign/comments/1kosmlf/how_much_effort_do_you_put_into_projects_for/

"What extra skills do I need to become an LMS administrator? Hi all,

I’m looking to pivot into a Canvas LMS Administrator role and would love some advice from folks in the field. I currently work in EdTech and have a strong background supporting LMS-integrated tools. In my current and previous roles, I’ve:

* Performed LTI 1.1 to 1.3 upgrades and installations
* Managed tool configurations within LMS subaccounts (mainly Canvas and D2L)
* Worked directly with developer keys and external app configurations
* Trained faculty and staff on integrated tools within Canvas
* Collaborated cross-functionally with QA, engineering, and product teams to resolve integration bugs and feature issues
* Written internal documentation and supported knowledge bases related to LMS usage

I also have experience with customer success, implementation, and training — but I’ve never been the official LMS admin for an institution.

What additional skills, tools, or certifications would make me a stronger candidate for an LMS admin position? Should I be learning more about API work, SIS integrations, backend admin functions, etc.?

"If you find AGES a bit too clinical or abstract, I wanted to share an internal model we use (refined from AGES) to make neuroscience-based learning design more understandable and actionable, specially for business audiences. We call it **CARS**:

**C – Connection:** Start by linking new material to what learners already know (stories, analogies, or discussions).

**A – Attention:** Design for attention *including* engagement, motivation, and emotional resonance. Use stories, feedback, real-world examples, and interactive activities to keep people truly invested.

**R – Retrieval:** Build in frequent opportunities for retrieval (quizzes, teach-backs, reflection). This *also includes* the principle of spacing, that is, revisiting key ideas over time for deeper retention.

**S – Sensory Integration:** Use a mix of visuals, audio, hands-on elements, and discussion. Engaging multiple senses helps learning stick and makes experiences more inclusive.

We created CARS to make these neuroscience concepts more actionable in the real world.
